<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to that Peerless Being Who, through the lights of the Kingdom, hath empowered and enabled the world of creation to receive the word of wisdom and utterance. After the word was cast forth, a creation came into being, and through another word transformation was wrought: some turned toward the realm of oneness, having perceived the fragrance of the Friend, while others busied themselves with investigation, and yet others arose in rejection and protest. But God, our Lord and our Goal, manifested that which He desired despite them. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Glory, radiance, peace, and bounty be upon the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, who have sacrificed their souls in His path. These are servants whom He hath mentioned in His Books and commanded to reform the world and refine the souls of nations, forbidding them from treachery, rancor, and corruption. Exalted is God, our Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! At this moment thy petition hath attained unto the presence and the blessed hands of our Master and Lord, the Most Great Branch - may my spirit and my very being be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps - and after it had been honored to reach the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed and sent down from the Source of verses, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! The Lord of Power hath from His Most Sublime Vision directed His gaze toward that region and maketh mention of thee. Canst thou hear this Call which hath been raised from this Most Exalted Station, that through hearkening there may spring forth from the dust ears that are attentive, eyes that are sharp, and hearts that are illumined for witnessing and hearing? Say: Nay, by Thy Great Announcement, except through Thy grace, Thy generosity, Thy loving-kindness and Thy bounty. And shouldst thou desire to make mention of Me, it behooveth thee to make mention in such wise that the tongues of the world may speak in remembrance of thy Lord, through Whom the mysteries have been revealed, the rivers have flowed, and the trees have spoken forth - sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We have aforetime made mention of thee through verses that have encompassed the East of the earth and its West. Hast thou forgotten, or dost thou say ‘Increase me in utterance, O Lord of the mystics’? We love to behold thee standing amidst the gathering, speaking in My beauteous remembrance, and We love to see thee detached from all else but Me, calling out My Name, clinging to the cord of My loving-kindness and holding fast to My [luminous] robe. We have created thee and cast upon thee that which draweth thee nigh unto God and causeth thee to speak that whereby the hearts of them that have turned towards Him are attracted. Cast aside all else but Me and take what I have commanded thee in My perspicuous Book. This is the Day whereon they that were at Sinai were thunderstruck when the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and the Caller cried out: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the Mighty Throne! This is the Day whereon the seas speak through their waves, the Book through its verses, the suns through their lights, the heaven through its stars, the trees through their fruits, and the earth through its favors; yet most of the people hear not. They see, yet they deny - verily they perceive not. We behold them as worshippers of idle fancies and vain imaginings. This do attested servants bear witness, who have cast the Most Great Ocean behind them, hastening toward the river - verily they know not. O Ibn Abhar! Hear the Call with the ear of thine heart; verily it attracteth thee and draweth thee nigh unto a station that knoweth neither change nor decline. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken - verily He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. We have adorned thy head with the crown of acceptance and thy temple with the ornament of knowledge, that thou mayest proclaim the Cause of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Compassionate, the All-Loving. Thou hast stood before the gate of My grandeur, heard My Call, beheld the waves of the ocean of Mine utterance and the suns of the heavens of My wisdom. Give glad tidings of what We have shown thee and caused thee to hear in this Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious and Most Sublime Station. Thus have the rains of My mercy poured down and the luminary of My grace hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty. Say:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having illumined the horizon of my hope, for having quenched the thirst of my heart, and for having transformed my sorrow and grief. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity, by the lights of Thy Most Great Throne, to strengthen me in all conditions to manifest Thy Cause, Thy days, Thy revelation and Thy power. O Lord! Thou seest me calling out in Thy name amongst Thy servants, and speaking Thy praise throughout Thy lands. From the beginning of days I acknowledged Thy unity and Thy singleness, and became attracted to Thy verses, soaring in Thy atmosphere, and arising to serve Thee. Have mercy upon me, O my God, through Thy great mercy, then cause me to speak Thy sweetest remembrance. I am he, O my God, whose will was rendered powerless, seized by the wonderment of Thy call. I call upon Thee, O my God, by Thy gracious name, I cry unto Thee by Thy merciful name, and I adjure Thee by Thy all-knowing name to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto the court of Thy glorious oneness and the sanctuary of Thy holy uniqueness. Then through them open the doors of Thy servants’ hearts, and through them, O my God, illumine the hearts of Thy creation. Then write down for me and for them the reward of those who have attained unto Thy presence and have drunk the choice wine of reunion from the hand of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can render powerless. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleaseth through Thy power. Furthermore I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom and the effulgent lights of the orb of Thy grace, to ordain for Thy handmaiden who hath ascended unto Thee the reward of attaining Thy presence. Then cause her to enter, O my God, within the precincts of Thy mercy and to hear the melodies of the doves of Thy unity upon the twigs of the tree of Thy knowledge. Then give her to drink, O my Best-Beloved, the Kawthar of Thy utterance from the hand of Thy bounty. Then send down upon her from the clouds of Thy mercy the rains of Thy generosity and munificence. I testify, O my God, that she heard Thy call and responded to Thy summons and Thy command, and held fast to Thy cord in such wise that neither the doubts of the skeptics, nor the cawing of the croakers, nor the onslaught of the polytheists, nor the oppression of the wrongdoers could keep her back. The attraction of Thy call so seized her that her heart was set ablaze with the fire of Thy love and her reality with the heat of Thy affection. There befell her in Thy path that which Thou knowest better than any other. Forgive, O my God, her and those who loved her and mentioned her days and visited her resting-place and what hath been revealed from Thy Most Exalted Pen. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. At Thy command the ocean of forgiveness surgeth and the fragrances of Thy bounty are wafted abroad, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all possibilities. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We have desired at this moment to make mention of Our handmaiden who hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion, she upon whom the decree of destiny and fate from God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of heaven, hath been executed. O My handmaiden and My leaf! We testify that thou didst take the cup of utterance from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and didst drink therefrom, despite those women whom fancies and idle imaginings have held back from God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Thou art in the Most Exalted Paradise while thy Lord is in the prison of ’Akka. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this bounty, the light of which, when it shone forth, caused all names and attributes to bow down before it. We testify that thou didst hear the call and didst turn towards it, saying in thy inmost heart: “Here am I, here am I, O Lord of all beings! At Thy service, at Thy service, O Thou in Whose grasp is the control of all things!” Thou art she who rent asunder the veils of error and the layers of glory, and attained unto the recognition of thy Lord in days wherein men and women denied Him, save those whom the hand of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds, did rescue. Blessed art thou for having acknowledged the unity of God and His singleness, and what He hath revealed in His Book and what His Tongue hath uttered. How many were the days wherein thy sighs ascended and thy tears fell down in thy love for God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, and the Lord of the hereafter and of former times. Thou art she whom the fire of separation consumed and whom the force of estrangement weakened in the days of thy Lord, the Illuminator of the horizons. Sorrows overtook thee whereby thy liver was melted, thy heart was troubled, thy limbs did quake, and thy being was rent asunder. Were it not for thy Lord’s protection, thy members and extremities would have been scattered, and thy veins and features dispersed. Blessed art thou, O leaf that hath clung to the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, O thou who art mentioned by the people of Baha in the kingdom of creation! Through thy grief, sorrows have encompassed the people of the cities of knowledge, and through thy calamity, the dwellers of the garden of utterance have lamented. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee at all times that which befitteth the heaven of His bounty, the ocean of His generosity, and the sun of His grace. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Peace and glory and praise and honor be upon thee, upon thy beginning and thine end, thy outer and inner self, and the mercy of God and His blessings and His might and His favor and His gifts. Verily, grace is in His grasp and bounty in His right hand. He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thus hath it ended. Praise be to God! For that blessed leaf there hath been sent down from the clouds of divine mercy that whose mention, whose fragrance, and whose light shall endure. A hundred thousand thanks that she ascended in the days of God - days whereof all the Prophets and chosen ones had given tidings and had desired for themselves to be present and to attain unto them. O thou beloved of my heart! The power of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” cannot be hindered by the things of earth and heaven. However He willeth, it is decreed and assured. The command is God’s, our Lord, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. His grace hath encompassed all and His mercy hath taken precedence, and those sighs which in the nights and days were manifested from her in separation from the Lord of all beings - their effect hath He made manifest. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good, whether men or women, until in these blessed days there appeared that which hath had and shall have no likeness. Praise be unto Him in all conditions.</p>
<p>The mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Turab, upon him be the glory of God, was made, and his service, devotion and love, after being presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Alif and Ba! He Who is encompassed by the wicked ones among the servants from all directions makes mention of thee at this hour. Among them are those who deny Him, those who turn away from Him, those who oppose Him, and those who cling to tyranny and oppression and to calumnies at which the dwellers of the Kingdom, the Realm of Glory, the Concourse on High and the Most Exalted Paradise have lamented. Thus has the matter been decreed, and We are in manifest joy. We beseech God to assist thee in that which will elevate the station of man, to aid thee with the means of earth and heaven, and to ordain for thee from the heaven of His bounty and the clouds of His mercy that which will open the doors of hearts. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. Take thou the cup of eternity in My Most Glorious Name. It will attract thee to a station wherein thou wilt hear the call of all things in celebration of this Most Great Announcement, whereby the foundations of nations have been shaken, save whom God hath willed, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We have mentioned thee before, and at this hour, that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones. We beseech God to make thy rewards concerning His loved ones treasures with Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Preserver, the Trustworthy.”</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of Jinab-i-Mashhadi Rahim, Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Rahim, and Aqa Muhammad, upon them be the glory of God. After these names were presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed from the heaven of verses - exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O Mashhadi Rahim! The promise hath come to pass and the Command belongeth unto God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. He hath appeared, manifested His Cause, fulfilled His promise, and spoken that which draweth the people nigh unto God, the Lord of existence. O My loved ones! We have heard your call and witnessed your love. We have turned toward you from this forbidden Quarter and revealed for you that which hath diffused the fragrance of God’s grace, the Lord of existence. O Muhammad-i-Rahim! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having mentioned thee in the prison with verses whose fragrance will never cease and will not change throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm of spirit. Say: Thine is the glory, O my God, and Thine is the grandeur, O my Lord, and Thine is the grace, O my Beloved, for having caused me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy verses and the Dawning-Place of Thy clear tokens. I beseech Thee to make me in Thy days a flowing river through Thy name and an immovable mountain in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of the unseen and the visible. We have heard thy verses and what thou hast composed in remembrance of this Cause, through whose appearance the heaven was cleft asunder, the earth was rent, and the heart of every heedless and veiled one was shaken. Rejoice in that We have turned toward thee from this station and revealed for thee that whereby the realities of all things and the hearts of devoted servants have been attracted. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have laid hold upon this extended cord. O Muhammad! Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Countenance and for having turned unto Him from Whom the servants have turned away, save whom God hath willed, the Lord of this praiseworthy station. We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe trustworthiness, chastity and faithfulness. Blessed is he who hath cast away what the people possess and taken what is with God, the Lord of the angels and the Spirit.”</p>
<p>In that thou hast made mention of his honor Aqa Mirza Rida (of the land of Kaf and Ra), upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise hast recorded mention of his ardour and loftiness of understanding and sublimity of knowledge, after these passages were submitted before the Throne of our Lord, the Revealer of verses, this utterance was sent down from the heaven of the will of Him Who is the Desire of the worlds. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor</p>
<p>We have sent down a Book at whose descent all the books of the world bowed down in submission, whereunto beareth witness the Most Great Name, through which the limbs of the nations have quaked, save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, hath willed. The rivers of inner meanings and utterance have flowed in the garden of true knowledge. Blessed is he who hath heard their murmuring and the rustling of their trees, and woe unto every doubting denier. O Mirza Rida! Hearken unto the Call which hath been raised in the prison of Akka from the right hand of the luminous spot, from the Blessed Crimson Tree - God, there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and be not of them that denied God’s Manifestation and His sovereignty, and broke His covenant, and disputed that which appeared from His presence - these are indeed among the opposers in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Great. O Rida! Canst thou leave behind what the people possess, and canst thou proclaim among the servants this Name that holdeth sway over all who are in the heavens and on earth? We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee to exalt His Word and to manifest His Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the hosts of vain imaginings nor the suspicions of the opposers, and to make thee a leader of His servants, and to raise thee up through His Name that holdeth sway over all, whether small or great. Say: O people! This is a Day wherein the Herald calleth out from every direction and summoneth all unto the straight Path of God. When the rapture of My verses seizeth thee and thou drinkest the choice wine of utterance from the cup of My bounty, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanks be unto Thee, O my Desire, for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy manifestation and caused me to hear the Call that hath been raised amongst Thy servants and shown me Thy signs. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and holding fast to the hem of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, nor to withhold me from beholding the effulgences of the sun of Thy bounty. O my Lord! Thou seest the supplicant standing before the gate of Thy grandeur and the pavilion of Thy glory. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which Thou hast ordained for the sincere among Thy servants and the near ones among Thy creatures. O my Lord! Illumine my heart with the lights of Thy Kingdom and enable me to perform such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of Thy acceptance and good-pleasure. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Thus hath it ended. Who is able to reckon what hath appeared from the Kingdom of utterance of God, our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne? Can anyone count the drops of the seas, or the grains of the desert, or the leaves of the trees? Nay, by His Self, save through His might and power! The verses of God have been sent down in such wise that the Pen is powerless to set them down, and the tongue to make mention of them, and the faculty of comprehension to enumerate them. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn His servants with the ornaments of justice and truthfulness. Verily, He is the most powerful of the powerful. There is none other God but He, the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere! Before the Wronged One have been presented the names of those whom thou didst mention. We have desired to make mention of them in such wise as to perpetuate their remembrance amongst all names. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering</p>
<p>O My Tongue! Be thou a herald in the kingdom of My utterance, that perchance the call may attract those who dwell in the realm of creation and draw them nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon - the station which God hath made the circling-point of the Supreme Paradise and the Most Glorious Garden. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O friends of God and His loved ones! Upon you be His glory and His mercy. Your names have been presented before the Wronged One. We make mention of you with such mention that from each letter thereof floweth the river of life for the vivification of the world. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and within His grasp lie the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Take ye hold of the Book of God with such strength as is vouchsafed by Him and such power as proceedeth from His presence, in such wise that the clamor of the ignorant ones who claim knowledge without clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, shall not deter you. These are servants who denied God’s proofs both in the past and in the present, as His Perspicuous Book doth testify.</p>
<p>Read ye what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an that ye may become aware of that which befell the Daysprings of His verses, the Dawning-places of His revelations, the Recipients of His revelation and the Sources of His command, firm and mighty. For their sake did the Apostle lament, the Chaste One cry out, and the Spirit weep by reason of what these oppressors inflicted upon them. In their name did they usurp their station - they are assuredly among the most lost in God’s mighty and praiseworthy Book. They make mention of God with their tongues while they sanction the shedding of the blood of His chosen ones, and they perceive it not. They wrongfully consume the substance of men, and they understand not.</p>
<p>Say: Die in your wrath! Verily He hath come from the horizon of might with the banners of verses for the reformation of the world and the unification of nations. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this exalted station. By God’s life! Neither the vicissitudes of days, nor the oppression of men, nor imprisonment in the land of Ta [Tehran] or ’Akka have deterred Us. We have arisen before all faces and summoned all unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. They have cast the command of God behind their backs, clinging to that which they possess. Verily they know not. Soon shall the world pass away; then shall they behold the recompense of their deeds, and they shall cry for help but none shall help them. Thus hath the Pen revealed its treasures and the Ocean its waves. Blessed are they who recognize the splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy.</p>
<p>Upon you, O dawning-places of My love, and upon those whom the doubts of every heedless one that is veiled have not deterred.</p>
<p>The names are veiled due to the requirements of consummate wisdom. This servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid these blessed souls and ordain for them that which conduceth to eternal life and everlasting glory. Glory be to God! One is astonished to observe how, for the sake of two days, most people veil themselves from God’s eternal bounties and perpetual favors. What a tremendous loss! We hope that through the attention and favors of the Goal of the world’s desire, the veils of all the people of Iran may be rent asunder, and all may attain to that which hath had and hath no likeness or peer. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! One of the passages from your letter was presented before Him Who conversed with God on Sinai, was graced with acceptance, and adorned with the honor of His good-pleasure. As commanded, that passage is recorded here: “Your words and mention: O my God, my God! Those who know and are privy to Your mysteries are aware that these wronged ones, through the education and training of Your Supreme Pen, have desired nothing but the joy and tranquility of Your servants and the progress and advancement of all in the land under the shadow of mercy and kindness of this same Nasiri’d-Din Shah, who at times through wrath and severity - in following ignorant aggressors - and now through kindness and mercy - by his own will and desire - has arisen to aid Your manifest Faith. We have sought nothing else and desire naught from the peoples of the world save the manifestation of pure and goodly deeds and praiseworthy, virtuous character. We wish that those who claim faith among all the peoples of the world, in this realm which is encompassed by extinction, become people of eternity and companions of the highest paradise. Therefore, inspire them through pure grace and bounty with that which will sanctify them from the promptings of self and passion, and confirm them in chastity, virtue, righteousness and fear of God, and that which hath been revealed from Thee in Thy Scriptures and Tablets. There is no God but Thee, the Lord of all beings, the King of the throne on high and of earth below. Verily, Thou art the All-Merciful, the Possessor of great bounty.”</p>
<p>It is hoped that whatever that beloved one has beseeched will be answered, and that the friends of God, exalted be His glory, will be assisted in that which will cause the peoples of the world to turn towards Him. At one time this most exalted and blessed word was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of Names - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “The endeavor of My loved ones - upon them be My glory and loving-kindness - must be directed towards the sanctification and purification of souls, not the arrangement of their own affairs.” We beseech God to illumine and bless the eye of the age with the vision of such souls.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Taqi and Aqa Mirza ’Ali, upon them be the glory of God. After being presented before the throne of the Goal of the worlds, this answer was revealed - exalted be His utterance and all-encompassing His bounty: “O Muhammad-Taqi, upon thee be My glory! This day is a blessed day. God willing, the people of Baha will drink from the chalice of steadfastness, lest names hold them back from their Kingdom and their Creator, and lest the world, its riches and its ornaments prevent them. We have mentioned thee before and at this time with a mention before which all things have bowed down, as the Mother Book beareth witness in this luminous station. And We make mention of him who is named ’Ali that he may hear and be of the thankful ones. O ’Ali! Thy name hath been mentioned before the Wronged One. We have revealed for thee that through which the fragrance of the verses hath wafted throughout all possibility. We beseech God to assist thee to turn wholly unto Him and to exalt thee through His name. Verily, He is powerful over all things. We have desired at this time to make mention of your father as a bounty from Us, and verily We are the Bountiful, the Generous. We beseech God to send down upon him at this time mercy from His presence and to cause him to enter the highest paradise, and to ordain for him every blessing and every heavenly table that He hath ordained for His chosen ones and trusted ones. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. His mercy hath preceded and His generosity hath encompassed all. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>Mention of Jinab-i-Rabi’, upon him be the Glory of God, is remembered and presented, and these verses specifically for him are revealed from the heaven of grace. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks: O Rabi’, praise be to God that in the divine springtime thou hast turned to the flowers of inner meanings and partaken of the flowing spiritual waters. We counsel thee to preserve this most exalted station and We beseech God to protect thee from the doubts of the suspicious ones and the arrows of the transgressors, and to aid thee with the hosts of utterance. He is the Mighty, the Bestower. The verses have been revealed and the evidences have appeared, yet the people are in strange doubt. Blessed art thou for having cast away vain imaginings and chosen the path of certitude from God, the Lord of all religions. We make mention in this station of him who is named Majid, who turned to My horizon and heard My sweetest call, by which the Concourse on High was attracted, and attained that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords. O Rabi’, if thou shouldst see him, give him My glad-tidings. We beseech God to assist him in His remembrance and praise, and in steadfastness in this Great News. We have mentioned him before with verses that nothing can equal, and We have remembered him with a remembrance whose fragrance shall endure as long as the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, endures. He hath drunk the choice wine of utterance from the hand of My bounty and hath attained that which most of the servants have not attained. The glory from Us be upon him and upon thee and upon everyone who hath turned to the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of the two illumined eyes of the exalted and deceased Haji Mirza Kamal’d-Din, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, who attained the presence of the Goal of the world. This is what was revealed for them both from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Answerer. Exalted be His utterance and glorified His proof:</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate, the Generous</p>
<p>O Nuru’d-Din! Verily Kamal’d-Din hath drunk from the hand of the bounty of the Lord of the Worlds the choice wine of utterance and hath attained the presence of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. He is among those who attained that which God revealed in the Bayan and in the Year Nine “ye shall attain unto all good.” We testify that he attained and realized all good, and there was revealed for him the interpretation of what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an in His exalted words “All food was lawful to the Children of Israel.” Thus did the grace of his Lord, the Powerful, the Forgiving, encompass him. O Nur! We saw thy name and made mention of thee as a bounty from Us, that thine eye might be solaced thereby and that thou mightest thank thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. We beseech God to send down upon thee a grace from His presence and a blessing from His side. He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Compelling. And We make mention of thy brother who is named Ali. Verily he was remembered before the Wronged One and was speaking of this Name through which God hath subdued the hearts of His servants. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me in the prison and revealed for me that which delighteth the eyes. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou hast made known to me Thy path and guided me to Thy station. I testify that in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Lamp reveal its lights, and the Book its verses, and the Light its radiance, as a grace from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The call is raised from all directions and the signs are spread abroad, yet the people are heedless and veiled save whom God willeth, our Lord, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. In all conditions We beseech God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of His servants, that perchance in this blessed Day they may not be deprived of the waves of the ocean of bounty and may attain that whose fragrance is everlasting. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>O ’Ata’u’llah! The Wronged One remembers thee and turns unto thee at this hour with a mention from which the fragrance of thy Lord’s mercy is wafted throughout the world. To this beareth witness the Most Great Name in this exalted station.</p>
<p>We make mention of Mahmud who turned unto the Cause when it was manifested, and was so transported by the rapture of the Divine Call that he hastened to the Dawning-Place of Verses, traversing land and sea until he attained the presence of his Lord and bore witness to that whereunto God had testified before the creation of earth and heaven. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. We testify that he is among those who have attained in My perspicuous Book. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon him and upon thee and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. He verily remembereth him who remembereth Him, and loveth him who turneth towards Him. He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the righteous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the knowing.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to each one, and remembereth the loved ones night and day, beseeching God–exalted be His glory–to enable the delight of the eyes, the chosen ones, and His loved ones in that land to achieve that which will exalt His Word and cause His servants to ascend. This is not difficult for our Lord. How many were the servants who, by merely accepting the blessed Word, attained the highest station of victory and triumph, and when the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree was ignited, all became enkindled by that holy and luminous flame and occupied themselves with guiding others. That which was manifested through those sanctified souls was more penetrating than the swords of the world. We hope that in this Most Great Revelation too, God’s loved ones will attain this station, will awaken those who slumber through His Word and guide them through His light. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We also make mention of Sina and Nayyir–upon them be the glory of God–and their arising to serve and their attention to the command to teach. These matters were presented before the Countenance of the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak: O Ibn Abhar! We have mentioned them before with verses from which the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, was diffused. We beseech God to preserve them through His grace, to aid them with the hosts of the seen and unseen, and to assist them in attracting hearts and souls. Blessed are they and blessed is he who hath held fast to the cord of turning unto God in this promised Day. Joy be to the hand that hath been raised to the heaven of His bounty, to the face that hath turned toward the horizon of His loving-kindness, and to the eye that hath beheld that which was hidden from the sight of every heedless and veiled one. This is the Day wherein that which was hidden in knowledge hath appeared and the mysteries of what was and what will be have emerged. We have mentioned them through Our bounty and given them glad-tidings of Our mercy which hath preceded all existence. We beseech God to manifest through them that which will draw people nigh unto His horizon and give them to drink of His choice sealed wine. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the kingdom of My loving-kindness be upon them from this exalted station.</p>
<p>Concerning the son of the Martyr, there was previously revealed regarding the charitable ones that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Blessed is the soul that hath held fast to what is right in His Cause, and blessed is the servant who hath spent what was possible for Him. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the righteous.</p>
<p>O Fakhru’d-Din! God hath come with manifest sovereignty and that which was hidden in knowledge and concealed from the eyes of the heedless hath been revealed. O Fakhru’d-Din! Say: O people, fear God and follow not every heedless and remote one. This is the Day of which the Messengers gave tidings and to which the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, have borne witness. Say: Your divines and what they possess will profit you not. Have ye not heard the Call which was raised in the beginning of days from God? He said, and His Word is the Truth: “O concourse of divines! Put down your pens, for the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised; cast away what ye have composed with the hands of fancy and vain imaginings. The Command hath come, and the Sun of Certitude hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of the Will of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.” They read the Book, yet deny God. Lo! they are among the most lost in My Great Book.</p>
<p>Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for thee that which causeth the hearts of them that know to rejoice. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My verses and art seized by the rapture of My call, say: “My God, my God! Thou seest the poor one seeking the ocean of Thy bounty and desiring the wonders of Thy grace and the manifestations of Thy bestowal. I beseech Thee by the Kawthar through which Thou didst quicken the servants and by the resplendent Light wherewith Thou didst illumine the lands, to make me of those whom the riches of the world, nor the ornaments of nations, nor the treasuries of kings have diverted. O Lord! I have turned with my whole being unto Thee and have laid hold on Thy cord. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which I have desired from the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest through Thy Name, the Mighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for the Leaf, the sister, upon her be the Glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word: O My Leaf and My handmaiden! We have remembered thee with verses whose mention shall not pass away nor shall their warmth be extinguished. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Thy name was revealed in the beginning of days from the tongue of God, the Lord of this mighty station. My favor hath encompassed thee and My mercy hath preceded thee. To this doth this clear Book bear witness. We have remembered thy mother when she ascended to the Most Exalted Horizon and have revealed for her that from which every possessor of spiritual sense perceiveth the fragrance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to send down upon her at all times a table from the heaven of His bounty and mercy from the clouds of His grace. Verily He is the Goal of them that know and the Beloved of the doers of good, both women and men.</p>
<p>And We make mention of thy other sister as a favor from Our presence and a mercy from Our side, and verily We are the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. O My handmaiden and My Leaf! Thy name was presented and the ocean of bounty surged and the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, wafted. We have remembered thee before and at this time with verses by which the hearts of them that are nigh have been attracted. Give thanks unto thy Lord and glorify His praise. Verily He hath remembered thee with that whose mention shall not pass away throughout the duration of My mighty and wondrous Kingdom. The Glory from Our presence be upon thee and upon her and upon every maid-servant who hath believed in the One, the All-Informed. The Essence of Grace proclaimeth and saith:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of the mystics and Beloved of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth! Thou hast illumined the horizons of Thy loved ones’ hearts with the light of Thy knowledge and hast acquainted them with that which most of Thy servants were prevented from knowing. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity to ordain for Thy servants and handmaidens that which shall cause them to be numbered with those who have no fear, nor are they grieved. Then assist them in that which shall raise the standards of Thy guidance and the manifestations of Thy mercy amongst Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the Compassionate, the Bestower, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Mirza Jalil, upon him be the Glory of God. Some time ago his petition reached the Most Holy Court, and each of the names mentioned therein was adorned with the waves of the ocean of divine bounty and utterance. Blessed and welcome be it unto them. And this is what was revealed for his honor Jalil, upon him be the Glory of God, at this time. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! Make mention on My behalf of My servant Jalil. Verily, We have remembered him and those who have believed in the verses that have encompassed existence, both seen and unseen. The events of the world do not prevent thy Lord, nor do the hosts of tyranny cause Him fear. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, a command from His presence. Verily, He is the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Aid your Lord through wisdom and utterance. He shall assist you with deeds and virtues by which minds and hearts shall be attracted. Thus hath the Wronged One spoken on this night wherein He desired to unite a handmaiden from among His handmaidens and a leaf from among His leaves with a mention from His Book who was named ’Abdu’l-Baha in the Supreme Horizon and in the Book of Names. Upon them both be My glory and My loving-kindness which hath preceded all that was and shall be. We beseech God to assist His loved ones in rending the veils. Verily, He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His command “Be!” and it is.</p>
<p>This night is a blessed night, for according to His will, mention was made of His Holiness the King of Martyrs, may the spirit of those near unto God be a sacrifice unto him, and at the dawn of this night the union and unity between the honored leaf and His Holiness the Beloved of hearts, ’Abdu’l-Baha, upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God, shall be outwardly confirmed and adorned, as ordained in the inner world which is the realm of God’s decree, exalted be His glory. In truth, consideration for the family in the Land of ?ad is incumbent upon all. There befell them that which hath befallen no one. The fear of those days prevented the small children from growing and developing; they appear weak. However, praise be to God, they are blessed with His presence and meeting. They dwell beneath the shade of pavilions, their sustenance the water of the Kawthar of meeting, their food the heavenly table, their clothing and garments the gifts and favors of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn them at all times with that which shall draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>O beloved House of Jinab-i-’Ayn va Ta, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious! Ye have ever been remembered and continue to be remembered. At this moment these exalted words have been revealed from the Dayspring of the favors of the Lord of Names and Attributes. His Word, exalted be His glory and mighty His utterance:</p>
<p>The House of ’Ayn va Ta hath ever been remembered in the Most Holy Court. We make mention of them through Our verses, give them glad-tidings of Our favor, and send down for them that from which the fragrance of Our bounty is diffused. O Ibn Abhar! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy. Mention of the people of that House hath flowed from the Will and Purpose, the Pen and the Tongue. Convey on behalf of the Wronged One greetings to Jinab-i-’Ayn va Ta, upon him be My grace and My mercy. Blessed is he! The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified to his acceptance, his turning unto God, his love, his charitable giving and that of his mother, and what he hath done for those who have ascended unto Us on this Straight Path and this Great News.</p>
<p>Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be My glory, hath repeatedly made mention of the two sisters, upon them be My glory, and hath mentioned ’Ayn va Ta and the others. In truth, the people of that house have, from the earliest days, turned unto God and have attained unto mention, praise and service to the Cause. We make mention of the daughter bearing My name, upon them both be My glory and My favor. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid her to hold fast to the cord of My love at all times. Glory be upon her and upon those with her from God, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who attained Our presence and his wife who acted in accordance with what was commanded in My Perspicuous Book. Blessed are they both and joy be unto them. We testify that they are among those who have attained in the presence of their Lord, the Commander, the All-Wise. Glory be from Us upon the people of that House and upon him who hath drunk the Kawthar of meeting from the hand of bounty, a grace from the One Who is All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention of the son of Dhabih and his wife that they may praise their Lord and be among the thankful. We give them glad tidings as We gave them before, and We beseech God to draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Protector of those who do good.</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! Jinab-i-Haji Siyyid Nasru’llah, upon him be My glory, hath been mentioned before the Wronged One. Give him the glad tidings of My turning toward him from the prison, and illumine him with the lights of My wondrous utterance. We have testified to his acceptance, his turning unto God, and his arising to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>We love to make mention in this station of My leaves and My handmaidens. We testify that they have drunk the wine of revelation from the hands of bounty and have witnessed what God witnessed before the creation of the heavens and earths - that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty. In truth, the aforementioned leaves, namely the aunt and her daughter Khadijih and her other daughter, have been and continue to be adorned with mention, praise, service, humility, submissiveness and steadfastness. Blessed are they from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the sons of the aunt have also attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. We beseech God to preserve them from His enemies, to protect them through His sovereignty, and to send down upon them His blessings. Verily, He hath power over all things. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>This servant also conveyeth greetings to each of the leaves and loved ones, and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to open a door for each one through a key from among His most beautiful Names, that all may remember His remembrance, utter His praise, and arise to serve Him. It is hoped that the ocean of mercy will grant what hath been besought. He is the All-Bountiful One Whose grace hath encompassed all and Whose bounty hath taken precedence. He manifesteth what He willeth in the kingdom, despite those who have denied Him and His verses, and have rejected His Manifestation and His evident sovereignty.</p>
<p>The letter from his honored brother, upon him be the Glory of God and His grace, which was written and sent to that person was presented before the Countenance of the Lord of creation and was favored with His hearing. It is hoped that something special will descend from the heaven of grace for him too, that which will sanctify him from the troubles of the world, so that he may ignite those regions with the new fire of love. Now this servant conveys greetings, praise, remembrance and glory to his service. It is hoped that the foundation of these two days will not prevent him from turning to the eternal world and God’s everlasting bounties. Through the power of certitude, may he speak from the pulpit of detachment with the blessed words “Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses.”</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Consider the power of the Supreme Pen, which has caused the call to penetrate all the mysteries of the world. In truth, if the souls of the world were to speak with fairness, they would all proclaim with every limb, even with their very hair, the blessed words “Verily He is the Most Powerful of the powerful ones.” Glory be to God! A call so loud that in these days a well-known great personage in one of the major cities mentioned that nothing worthy of mention is seen from the mystics and spiritual leaders of the world. In truth, today the call is raised from Akka, although outwardly neither blessed with His presence nor His traces; yet the people remain heedless and veiled. If they were to be granted but one drop from the ocean of fairness, all would proclaim “The Call belongs to God,” detached from all that is on earth. Blessed are the fair-minded, and blessed are those possessed of insight. Praise be to God, all the mentioned names have attained and been sustained from the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds.</p>
<p>And after completing the names, He said - and His word is the truth: We love to conclude this utterance with the mention of Ayyub, upon him be My glory and My grace, and those with him. O Ayyub! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Direction and the Supreme Horizon, then give thanks to Him Who has turned to you and sent down that which has caused hearts and minds to soar. We love faithfulness and remember whoever has remembered Me, turned to My countenance, and performed in My path that which has diffused the fragrance of satisfaction. Verily your Lord hears the call of His loved ones and sees their turning to Him. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We have mentioned you before and at this evident time. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect you from His tyrannical servants and to guard you with the hosts of the invisible and visible realms. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Lamp through which the hearts of Thy loved ones were illumined and by which all that was and will be was lit, to assist me to remember Thee and praise Thee with wisdom and utterance, and to aid Thy Cause among the religions. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. O Lord! Deprive me not of the ocean of Thy bounty, nor forbid me from the pearls treasured in the vaults of Thy Supreme Pen. Verily Thou art the Owner of the Kingdom of Names and the Creator of heaven. Every tongue hath testified to Thy power and might, and to Thy grandeur and sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The gaze of loving-kindness hath ever been and still is directed towards the loved ones of God. Should we, God forbid, commit any oversight, the Truth Itself will remind and make mention thereof. We beseech Him at this moment to confirm His loved ones, His servants male and female, and His leaves in their steadfastness in His Cause and their arising to serve His loved ones. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. This servant addresseth all with these words: Glory and remembrance and praise and magnification, which have been honored with acceptance in the presence of our Lord, the Most Glorious, be upon you, O loved ones of God, His handmaidens and leaves. And I beseech for them that which shall adorn their deeds with the ornament of divine acceptance and exalt them through the everlasting Kingdom. Verily He is powerful over all things. There is no God but Him, the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O servant! Hearken to the call of this Youth from the direction of the Throne, that the call of the All-Merciful may draw thee to His paradise, the inaccessible, the mighty, the protected. Then know that whenever this Youth turneth His gaze toward His own self, He findeth it the most insignificant of all existence, but whenever He turneth His sight to the effulgences which have appeared from it, He findeth it the Sovereign of the invisible and visible. Glorified be He Who hath sent forth the Manifestation of His Self in truth and dispatched Him to all who witness and are witnessed, Who hath established Him in His own station and caused Him to speak His praise in such wise that neither the clamor of the nations nor the might of kings hath deterred Him. Say: He is in truth the Possessor of all kings - all are His subjects - and He is the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed art thou for having believed in God and the Manifestation of His Self, and for having associated with those through whom this blessed Tree was raised up to this praiseworthy station. He shall not suffer thy service to them to be lost, and God shall reward thee with a recompense that cannot be equaled by aught that exists or exists not. Soar then in the atmosphere of thy Lord’s love, and detach thyself from those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Loving.

<p>This is the Book of My Testament after Me. O people of the Concourse, hearken unto it!</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal, the Single, the Powerful, the Holy.</p>
<p>O Thou Who art hidden in the unseen realm! Hear the call of this blessed, radiant Leaf which speaketh by the leave of God and addresseth you from behind the veils, from the right side of the Tree of Life in the Mount of Glory, the Holy Land. God, there is no God but Him, the Living, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beloved. He is the One Whom God hath made the Self-Subsisting over all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. And He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Verily, it is the Lamp of Eternity which illumineth the Lantern of Heaven like unto the sun in a crystal dome. O people of the Concourse, before it fall ye down in adoration! Say: Verily, it is the Path of God which is established upon the Throne of the unseen realm. Pass ye thereon that ye may prosper. Verily, it is the Ark of God which saileth upon the sea of light. Embark therein that ye may be preserved.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the Rod of God which became a serpent to those who prostrated not before God, the Single, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy, and a blessing unto those who attained the presence of their Lord. Say: Verily, it is the Cave of Oneness. Whoso entereth therein is saved, and whoso turneth away therefrom perisheth. Yet few of you are mindful.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the Fountain of Life. Whoso drinketh a drop therefrom hath entered the Tablet of Immortality. Hasten, O people of the Concourse, that perchance ye may drink! Say: Verily, it is the Command of God which hath been breathed into the Trumpet of Creation, whereupon all who are in the heavens and the earth have swooned away, save a few of His sincere servants.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the Fire of God which hath been kindled in your hearts, yet ye perceive it not. Say: Verily, it is the Throne of God whereon the Manifestation of His Self hath reclined, and whoso is thereon is on the straight and extended Path of Truth. Say: Verily, it is the Water of the Cloud which floweth by God’s leave in pure rivers, yet few of you ponder.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the White Hand in the Mount of Decree, calling unto you from every direction, yet ye remain heedless. Say: Verily, it is the Sun of Oneness which hath risen from the Horizon of Light. Behold it, O people of the Concourse, if ye have eyes to see! Say: Verily, it is the Moon of the unseen realm which hath appeared from the direction of Heaven. Hasten unto it if ye be of those who believe.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the Handiwork of God. Can any creation of the servants resemble it? Nay, by thy life, even though all may possess power. Say: Verily, it is the Sovereign of Judgment. Can anyone share with Him in authority? Nay, by thy Lord, though all may claim such for themselves.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the Lamp of Command which shineth by God’s leave from behind the glass in the Land of the unseen realm, the hidden Glory, encompassing your hearts so that all may be convinced that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Guardian, the Powerful. Say: Verily, it is the Countenance of Light which hath been established upon the Throne of Bounty. Recognize it that ye may be guided.</p>
<p>Say: Unto whom belongeth the sovereignty this Day? Thou shalt not find any possessor of light who will answer. Then shall We proclaim: Unto God, in Whose grasp of power is the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no God but Him, the Living, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Say: Were ye to search throughout the highest heavens and all therein, and the lowest earths and all that are thereon, would ye find a creator other than God? Say: Glory be to God above that which ye imagine! Say: Verily, in the wonders of the verses are clear proofs for a people who are guided. Say: Verily, in the creation of your souls and hearts and the differences in your stations are signs for you, if ye would know. Say: Verily, in the spirit of the verses are manifest evidences and pervading fragrances for a people who perceive.</p>
<p>Say: Verily, the rivers of utterance have been concealed in the garden of light. Such is the decree of God which was ordained aforetime in the Book of thy Lord, and we all believe in them.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God! Do Thou reveal the rivers of Thy sovereign might that the water of unity may flow within the inmost realities of all things, in such wise that the ensigns of Thy guidance will be upraised in the kingdom of Thy Cause and the stars of Thy luminescence will shine with a scintillating splendor in the heavens of Thy glory. Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Verily, Thou art the Help in peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who sendeth down the verses as He pleaseth, as a bounty from His presence! He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. With Him are the treasuries of light which He revealeth unto whomsoever He willeth among His creation, though the polytheists be averse. His is the creation and the command. He giveth life and causeth death, then giveth life through His grace as He willeth�“a command from His presence unto a people who are grateful.</p>
<p>He it is Who hath subdued all authority by His decree and sent down the light by His leave. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Say: All are submissive unto Him. Say: The decree of thy Lord hath been fulfilled, the veils have been lifted, and the Light hath been established upon the Throne of the unseen realm. How is it that ye perceive not?</p>
<p>O people of the Bayán! Recognize the value of these days, then present yourselves before Him and fall prostrate before Him. Say: Woe unto you! The Beauty shall be concealed in the vestures of Glory, and ye shall then supplicate and lament. Say: This is the Dove of Remembrance, mentioning you more excellently than ye make mention. Say: Woe unto you and unto what your hands have wrought! Do ye call upon what your souls desire and associate partners with God, your Lord?</p>
<p>He it is Who created you and provided for you and made you to grow, that ye might walk upon the earth and believe in God, the Self-Sufficient, the Powerful, the Loving. Say: He it is Who appointed for you the sun for brightness that ye might be illumined thereby, and the moon for light that ye might be guided thereby and be among those who, in the darkness of the earth, are guided by the light of their Lord.</p>
<p>Do ye not see that the heavens of creation were raised up by His command, and upon them is established a sun from the light of thy Lord, and therein He hath ordained moons that shine forth and stars that radiate�“a bounty from His presence unto a people who understand? Say: Verily, your hearts and souls and frames bear witness that there is no God but Him, yet ye comprehend not.</p>
<p>O people of the Concourse! Do ye find any changer besides God or any interpreter apart from Him? Say: Glory be to God above what ye associate with Him! Say: The light of God hath encompassed you from every quarter, and the Spirit of the Command strengtheneth you at all times, if ye would but recognize it. Say: The spirits of the Prophets are attached to His light. How is it that ye are not guided nor do ye see? Say: Is there any withholder or sender apart from God? Say: Glory be to God above what ye know!</p>
<p>Say: Verily, it is the light of your Lord in the wonders of the verses, from the right side of the yellow Tree upon white leaves. God, there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Goal of all desire. Say: He it is Who sendeth the winds as heralds from His presence, Who raiseth the heavens and sendeth down the light, that ye may be assured of the meeting with your Lord. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and unto Him shall all return.</p>
<p>He it is Who hath distinguished for you in the Book the paths of righteousness from error, and hath sent down therein the verses as an exposition of all things, a guidance and a light unto a people who understand. God hath decreed in the Book, after the Remembrance, that ye should turn to the Focal Point of the Command in these days. Whoso turneth away from the decree of his Lord hath indeed strayed from the path of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted.</p>
<p>He it is Who warneth you of the fire of your own selves, as a recompense for what ye have wrought. Unto Him submitteth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and all are assured of Him. Then shall the Announcer cry out from the unseen realm: “Those who have believed in God and His signs and have followed what God hath prescribed in the Book�”these are the companions of divine justice and shall abide forever in the Garden of Light. As for those who have turned away from the command of God, thy Lord, and have obeyed whatsoever their souls desired�“these are the companions of the Fire, and therein shall they be punished.”</p>
<p>O people of the Bayán! Is anyone able to produce the like of what God hath sent down in the Book? Say: Glory be to God! All are His servants and all are humble before Him. Say: He it is Who hath decreed in the Book the exposition of all things, as a guidance and mercy unto a people who remember. There is nothing whose decree hath not been sent down in the Book�“a remembrance from His presence unto a people who perceive.</p>
<p>Say: He is God Who sendeth down tranquillity, lifteth the veils, and dispatcheth the angels of victory with the hosts of the heavens and the earth to aid those who aid Him. Verily, He is the Mystery in the Tree, calling unto you from all directions�“the Throne of Sinai, the Land of Revelation. God! God! The Mighty, the Luminous, the Powerful, the Guardian, the Goal of all desire!</p>
<p>Then are the allusions lifted from the words, and the heavenly maidens appear from behind the veils�“a remembrance from One praised and glorified. Say: The likeness of those who turn away from the Countenance of Light and claim authority without being touched by the fire from the yellow Tree, is as the likeness of a shadow in the presence of the sun. Doth any light remain therein? If ye would but ponder a little!</p>
<p>And the likeness of those who believe in God and His signs and in the Countenance of Light is as the likeness of a light kindled from the Tree of Light, shining therefrom as if it were a yellow, radiant flame, delighting the beholders. And now hath the Command come at this moment from God�“the Guardian, the Mighty, the Jealous�”to purify me from His handmaiden, and accordingly are we acting.</p>
<p>O handmaiden of God! Depart from that house and dwell in another house�“a command from the presence of One beloved and praised. Then seek forgiveness for thy sin and ask God for the wonders of His bounty, for He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and we are all supplicants of His grace.</p>
<p>Then bear witness that the entire Command is from His presence, and the heavens are folded up in His right hand, and the angels prostrate themselves before His Countenance, and the sun and the moon and the stars are apprehensive through fear of Him. He is the Truth in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and all are in dread of His awe. Say:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art verily the Sovereign of the heavens of grandeur and the King of the realm of splendor. Thou forgivest whomsoever Thou willest, and chastisest whomsoever Thou willest; Thou aidest whomsoever Thou willest, and abandonest whomsoever Thou willest. In Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things; Thou rulest whatsoever Thou desirest by Thine irresistible command “Be,” and it is. Unto Him belongeth the unseen of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and He verily knoweth all that ye perform and all that ye conceal.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Lord! Thou knowest full well that I summoned Thy servants only according to that which Thou didst prescribe in the Book, after Thou hadst made me to hearken unto Thy Call upon the Mount of Decree, proclaiming: “O all things! Ye are in truth bereft of that which God Himself hath witnessed, and bear no true witness.”</p>
<p>Thereupon the heavens were upraised by His Command, and the earths drank deep of His waters; the decree of Thy Lord was accomplished; the Ark of God rode securely upon the surging waters of a righteous Cause; and it was proclaimed: “Away with the people of corruption!”</p>
<p>Thus would Thy remembrance endure in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth, and Thy sovereignty be established over all things; for Thou art verily the All-Powerful, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>And verily this is the mystery in the cycle of successive worlds; none shall attain unto the reality of this matter save he who cometh unto God with a thankful heart. Say: Fear ye God, and follow not the promptings of your own selves. Do whatsoever God hath commanded you in the Book, for therein lieth your supreme good, did ye but know. He it is Who hath enjoined upon you righteousness and prosperity, Who hath made manifest unto you the fountains of wisdom, and Who hath taught you that which ye knew not.</p>
<p>It beseemeth no soul to alter a single letter of the Book, nor to exchange a single decree thereof, save him who hath revealed it aforetime, for He it is Who sendeth down again, through His bounty, whatsoever He willeth, for the guidance of a people who are rightly directed. Say: Woe betide you! Can ye find any beside God who maketh lawful or unlawful, or any giver besides Him? How is it that ye are not awakened, that ye reflect not?</p>
<p>I counsel you, O servants, with that wherewith God hath counselled you aforetime in Tablets inscribed with the fingers of might: Bear witness within your hearts that the Remnant of God in these days is the Manifestation of Light, and the fulfillment of the awaited promise �” a truth whereof there is no doubt. Verily, We are all expectant.</p>
<p>Say: Fear ye God, and unite in His Cause, and diverge not. For he, verily, is the Burden borne by the heavens and the earth, and the Most Great Word enshrined in a treasured, exalted Book. They who have turned away from God, thy Lord, and who pervert the words from their rightful places �” these have forsaken the straight Path, and of their plight they remain unaware.</p>
<p>Say: This is indeed the Path of God in the heavens and the earth; upon it have all the Prophets and Messengers trodden, while ye remain heedless. Fear ye God, and exchange not the light for darkness, nor the pearls for stones, nor the morning for the nightfall �” how little is it that ye comprehend!</p>
<p>He it is Who created you, and fashioned you, and thereafter shed upon you the radiance of His wondrous bounty, and strengthened you with the hosts of the heavens and the earth, that haply ye might be thankful.</p>
<p>Bear ye witness then that I am but a servant who hath believed in God and in the Manifestation of Light, and hath taken his seat at the Point of Sorrow, in utmost abasement, moved by naught save the thread of grief traced upon the Tablets of might and grandeur.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the deniers! Have ye heard aught from me save the words of servitude? Say: Woe betide you! Do ye profess to believe in God, yet against His servant do ye devise falsehoods and trespass His right?</p>
<p>Say: Were I to recount but a drop from the oceans of grief that beset Me in these days, the souls of all created things would perish, and the skins of the sincere would shudder with terror.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Lord! Bring Thou nigh the days of my ascension unto Thee, and uplift me unto the court of Thy sanctity. Wert Thou not the One Who respondeth to the cry of the distressed when he calleth upon Thee? Behold, I am the first who hath cried out unto Thee; answer, then, my prayer, and remove from me all affliction, for Thou art verily potent over all things. Verily, Thou art the True One, the All-Knowing, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Thou hearest my lamentations and my cries, and beholdest the agitation of my heart and the burning of my soul in the depths of my bosom, as though it were consumed even as oil in vessels firmly set upon a sea of fire. Wilt Thou not, after all this, show mercy unto me�“after Thou hast uplifted me unto the heavens of Thy majesty, and after mine own certitude that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Forgiving?</p>
<p>And shouldst Thou withhold my ascent, then strengthen Thou mine arms in the promotion of Thy victory, and make firm my steps upon Thy straight Path, for Thou art verily the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Verily, those who have uttered against Me that which they heard not from Me�“these are but the creeping things of the earth, void of knowledge of the Cause and bereft of any understanding. Say: Doth not suffice you the Radiance of the Light Who is seated upon the Throne of Command, dispensing from behind the veils of concealment a Cause sent down from God, the All-Compelling, the All-Subsisting?</p>
<p>O concourse of the deniers! Did I not summon you by God and His signs, by the Manifestation of the Light, and did I not bear witness unto you the paths of guidance and the Remnant of the Awaited One? Better indeed would it be for you, did ye but know.</p>
<p>Say: Are many lords better, or God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Well-Beloved?</p>
<p>He it is Who hath raised up the heavens and sent down the Book with the truth, wherein are clear and manifest signs, and scriptures firmly established. How is it that ye reflect not, nor take heed?</p>
<p>He it is Who hath revealed unto you the wonders of Paradise, wherein are fashioned houris who mirror forth the very essence of beauty, a bounty bestowed by One Who is Wise and Compassionate. Verily, therein are trees as though planted upon the Mount of Fire, and yet, there is none other God but He, the Sovereign, the All-Feared.</p>
<p>And therein are rivers, where the waters flow from the Ocean of Pre-existence, gleaming like unto pearls of purest white, that haply ye may drink thereof. All this hath been prepared for you, yet how little is it that ye perceive!</p>
<p>Hasten then, O concourse of men, that perchance ye may enter the Paradise of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and therein partake of the delights thereof. This is but an admonition unto you and unto such as have prostrated themselves before the face of God.</p>

This is that which the Tongue of the Unconstrained hath voiced regarding the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar; He, exalted be His majesty and power, sayeth:</p>
<p>“Give thou praise unto the Desire of the World for having confirmed thee in service to His Cause! Thou and the friends have clearly manifested the remembrance and mention of God despite the tumult of the people of the world and the mischief, sedition, and arising of all to quench the Light. This structure shall be remembered eternally, for it hath been reared up in the name of God and during the days of God, and hath been adorned with the ornament of approval. Beseech thou God to confirm all in service to the Cause and in steadfastness, and in that which God hath revealed in the Book. Erelong, the world shall pass away, and all shall return to nothingness. What endureth is that which the Most Exalted Pen hath ordained at the bidding of God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal.”</p>
<p>All praise, all glory, and all remembrance befitteth the most holy, most exalted, most sublime and wondrous court of the Desired One, whose threshold hath ever been and shall forever remain the dwelling-place of them that are nigh unto God, the refuge of them that profess His oneness and are sincere in their devotion. He is the One Almighty whom neither the barking of the dogs of the earth nor the grunting of the swine of diverse lands could deter from His purpose. The swords and hosts of the world could not withhold Him from His will. At times His call was raised from the land, at others from the sea, and at still others from the mountains, in such wise that every hearing ear hearkened thereto and every conscious heart was made aware. The more the heedless among His servants sought to harm Him, the more manifest became His Cause and the more exalted His call. Those who were honored and renowned through His Name arose at the outset of His Revelation to voice such objections and protests as the world had never before witnessed. The primary cause and reason for their turning away and protesting were the divines of that age, whom the ignorant people blindly followed. To such an extent did they arise to harm Him that all things were moved to lamentation and weeping, and so difficult became the situation for the loved ones of God that they could find neither refuge nor repose. Yet despite all the tribulations that befell them and the afflictions that descended upon them, these steadfast souls shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of constancy like unto the Greater Luminary, for the world and all that is therein were regarded by them as worth less than a gnat’s wing, nay less still. They are the Hands of God’s Cause and His signs amongst His servants and His standards in His lands - servants who have bowed their necks before the countenance of God, the Lord of all beings, whose voices are hushed at the mention of His Most Glorious Name, and whose eyes overflow with tears at what hath befallen God at the hands of them that have broken His Covenant and His Testament, cast behind their backs His Book, disputed His verses, and finally warred against His very Self and with manifest tyranny sent Him to this place which hath been named the Most Great Prison by the tongue of Him Who is our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the standards have been raised aloft, the tokens have appeared, the trees of utterance have been planted in the garden of true understanding, and the river of life hath flowed throughout all contingent being! I beseech Thee to assist those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from Thy remembrance, O Lord of all names, and whom no earthly might hath kept back from the Most Sublime Horizon. I moreover beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen realms, to aid Thy loved ones with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>And furthermore, thy letters were received, and each bore true witness and gave eloquent testimony to the praise and glorification of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal, the Object of worship of all who dwell on earth and in heaven. In truth, the fragrance of that honored one’s love was diffused therefrom. Well is it with thee, and again, well is it with thee, for thou hast drunk from the cup of the All-Merciful’s love and partaken of the outpourings of the ocean of certitude. This servant was so delighted and gladdened by his words that the pen fails to describe it, for it is abundantly clear that every utterance and expression from which the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds is wafted brings fresh life to the soul and boundless joy to the spirit. In truth, this station transcends description and is sanctified above all praise. A hundred thousand blessings upon that honored one who has attained to that which the world, after long anticipation, was found to be heedless of, save those whom God has willed. In any case, after reading and becoming acquainted with it, I repaired to that station where “God was, and there was none beside Him.” After attaining to the presence and observing silence, permission was granted, and thy petition and letter were presented in their entirety. These sublime words were then revealed in response from the Kingdom of Divine utterance - exalted be His might and majesty - and these are His mighty words:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Hearer, in My Name, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli! In these days, at every moment, from the murmuring of the Kawthar of inner meanings, flowing from the right hand of the Divine Throne, a word is heard, and this exalted word has now attained to the hearing of the Lord of Names. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded, and hath arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. By the life of the Desired One! Whoso hath attained unto it is longed for by the highest Paradise and the dwellers of the most exalted Heaven and those who circle round His mighty Throne. O Muhammad-Qabli! Thou hast heard the call of the Wronged One time and again, and this is yet another time, a bounty from His presence - and He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Noble. The servant who is present came with thy letter and presented it before the Face while the Wronged One was in evident sorrow. By God’s life! My sorrow is not for My imprisonment, nor for what hath befallen Me at the hands of Mine enemies, but rather for those who attribute themselves to Us yet commit that which causeth the tears to flow from the eyes of them that know. This is a Day whereon it behooveth every soul who hath turned to the Face to adopt My attributes and to hold fast to that which hath been sent down in My wondrous Book.</p>
<p>Hear in the Persian tongue! The grief of God hath ever been due to the deeds that have appeared from His loved ones. The imprisonment of Mihdi and those who were with him, and what befell Me in the path of God, have not been and are not the cause of sorrow. Rather, this station is one of supreme joy, greatest delight and complete gladness. Today in one of the Tablets this most great verse was revealed from the Supreme Pen: “Blessed are they who have entered prison in My path and whom tribulation hath befallen for My Name. By God’s life! Their abasement is not equaled by the glory of the world, nor their poverty by the wealth of princes, nor by the treasures of those whom riches have kept back from the Ultimate Goal.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli! The opposition and objections of princes, divines and doctors are as water for the Divine Lote-Tree and as the spring breezes for it. Its effects are manifest and its fruits evident. However, unseemly deeds and conduct that conflict with God’s Book are observed to be as poison, for the heedless people attribute them to the Truth. Today one must aid the Cause of God through the hosts of spiritual virtues, goodly words, and deeds that are pleasing and acceptable. These hosts are and have ever been mightier than the hosts of the world.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! In truth I say, every word that shineth forth from the Dayspring of Divine utterance is as the sun, and every letter is as an ocean. How excellent is the state of him who is illumined by the splendors of the Sun of His utterance and who hath drunk from the ocean of meanings. O ’Ali! The heedless have not entered the school of awareness nor drunk from the ocean of knowledge. The fingers of power have fashioned from the tablets of utterance the armor of certitude, yet most of the people of the realm of possibilities have passed by the first adorning and clung to the garments of fancy and idle imaginings. Fie upon them and upon those who followed them without clear proof from Us and evidence from Our presence!</p>
<p>Gladden the loved ones of those regions and that place through God’s - glorified be His majesty - care and kindness. Say: Know ye the value of these divine days and arise as behooveth you. Today the Balance is visible, the Path manifest, the Call raised high, and the Mother Book speaking. Strive that perchance ye may be blessed with a word of acceptance from the Supreme Pen, or be assisted to perform a deed whose fragrance shall never fade. I swear by the Sun of Truth which shineth resplendent from the horizon of the Most Great Prison! If anyone were to become aware of the reward for good deeds, even to the extent of a mustard seed, he would freely sacrifice his life to attain it.</p>
<p>O friends! These are days around which all centuries and ages revolve, and this is a time before which all times in the world bow down in humility. Let not the diverse colors of the world deprive you of everlasting bounty and eternal, enduring blessings. We beseech God - glorified be His majesty - not to deprive those cities and lands that are the dwelling-places of His loved ones from the effulgences of the lights of the sun of religion, truthfulness and trustworthiness. He is the One with power whom the veils of the world have not hindered.</p>
<p>He is the All-Powerful One Whom the veils of the world have not hindered and the might of nations has not prevented from His purpose. Thou shalt not grieve over anything. Rejoice in this Most Great Tablet, from which the Concourse on High has inhaled the fragrance of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings. The splendor shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have been awakened by the Call and have answered their Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>The tongue of the All-Merciful speaketh; it is its own interpreter and its own expounder. The words, utterances and petitions of this evanescent one are as nothingness before His presence and as feeble before the kingdom of utterance. Yet since this is the day of supreme bounty and greatest favor, every soul may confidently engage in mentioning the Beloved. Had mercy not preceded and grace not been witnessed, this evanescent one would never have dared to speak a word. In all conditions, I beseech pardon from God, exalted be His glory, and entreat His loved ones not to forget this servant in their moments of remembrance, meditation and tranquility of heart.</p>
<p>That which hath flowed from the tongue of grandeur clearly manifests the degrees of love, mercy, grace and kindness of God, exalted be His glory, towards you. Praise be to God, you have attained unto that which hath no likeness or equal. You and this evanescent one and the other friends must beseech God to adorn the world with the light of justice and fairness and to guide the transgressors. He is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>As to your mention of Ridvan and the arrival of divine verses and the joy and gladness of the friends - these matters were presented before the throne and attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. His word, exalted be His grandeur, once again:</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned towards Me! Blessed is he who hath attained unto My good-pleasure in My Ridvan and hath acted according to what was commanded in the Book of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thou hast heard the Call before and after; hearken now in this moment wherein the Ancient Beauty hath spoken: Verily there is no God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. Counsel My loved ones with wisdom and utterance lest there appear that which would trouble the hearts of the weak ones. This is what hath been sent down at this moment and before in the tablets of thy Lord, the Knower of the seen and unseen. Say: O people of the village! Do what ye have been commanded in My Book. Verily He will be with you in every world of the worlds of your Lord, did ye but know. Rejoice in My remembrance of you, for nothing that hath been created on earth can equal it, to this do honored servants bear witness. None should speak that which would cause clamor to arise between the cities and villages. He counseleth you as a grace from His presence, and He is the Counselor, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Blessed are those souls who have attained unto the good-pleasure of God in His Ridvan. Happy are they and joy be unto them. May the bestowal of this cup never cease and may His loved ones never be deprived of the outpourings of this chalice. Verily He is the Bestower, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>As to their desire for circumambulation and turning towards the Most Exalted Horizon, these two matters were presented at the Threshold of Divine Unity. Permission for circumambulation was granted, and this servant proudly performed it as your representative. Praise be to God in all conditions! I swear by the Beloved of the world that if this servant were to declare that a single circumambulation around Him exceeds the worship of all humanity and the jinn, it would be truth itself. Rather, he considers himself lacking and deficient in making even this statement, for the rewards of this deed are and have been unlimited, and none save divine knowledge has encompassed it. As the Bab - may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake - addressed the honored Azim, upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory, saying: “Verily, to sit for one hour in His presence is better than the worship of both worlds.”</p>
<p>As for the matter of attaining His presence, after it was presented at the Most Holy Court, this exalted Word was revealed from the Most Exalted Horizon. He says, exalted be His glory and majesty:</p>
<p>“O Muhammad-Qabli-Ali! God created the world for the purpose of turning to My countenance, standing before My gate, gazing toward My horizon, and speaking My beautiful praise. Yet when the Supreme Luminary illumined the horizon of the world, the nations turned away, save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, willed. The Books of God have spoken of this Name and given glad tidings of this Day wherein He Who conversed on Sinai proclaims: ‘There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful.’ The Cry has been raised, the Tree has called out, the Calamity has struck, the Inevitable has come to pass, the Trump has sounded, and the hidden Secret has been revealed, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have risen in opposition to such an extent that they have denied what was revealed in the Books of God, the Exalted, the Great. They have broken God’s Covenant and cast His Book behind their backs. Verily, they are among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>“O Muhammad-Qabli-Ali! Hear in the Persian tongue what is sweeter: The whole world was created for the recognition of and meeting with Him on this blessed Day, and no deed can equal this deed. This act is seated upon the throne of glory and established at the fore of all existence. Nevertheless, the people have failed to recognize the worth of this Day and what has appeared therein, and have perpetrated that which has caused all atoms of creation, the dwellers of the highest chambers, and the manifestations of verses to lament and weep. By God’s life! The path to attaining His presence is clear and evident, and His loved ones are seeking it, yet heedless servants have prevented the people of Baha from reaching the Most Exalted Horizon and have held back the companions of the Crimson Ark from movement. The darkness of oppression has encompassed the world, and until this oppression ceases, neither kings nor subjects, neither rulers nor others shall find rest. Each day brings new hardship and fresh corruption, as you have seen and heard. In these days, due to the sedition in the Land of Ta, improper talk has somewhat spread even in this land. Therefore, we have paused in granting permission, and we beseech God, exalted be His glory, to record from the Supreme Pen the reward for attaining His presence. Verily, He has power over all things and is worthy to answer.”</p>
<p>Man needs a hundred thousand eyes to weep at what hath been inflicted upon the Self of God, exalted be His glory - that which all created things and beings are powerless to recount. They have attributed corruption to the Ocean of reformation, and injustice to the Dayspring of everlasting lights. Glory be to God! What heedlessness is this, that hath bewildered all the realms of knowledge. In any case, since the mercy of the Desired One hath taken precedence, we must, with utmost supplication and imploring, beseech the Almighty not to deprive His servants and to grant them a portion from the ocean of vision, that perchance they may attain unto consciousness and arise to do what behooveth them. He is the Generous, He is the Merciful, and He is the Bestower, the Kind. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the bathhouse and the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, it was presented before Him from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden. This is what the Tongue of the Chosen One hath spoken regarding the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar, exalted be His majesty and His power:</p>
<p>Praise be to the Desired One of the world Who hath enabled thee to serve His Cause. Despite the clamor of the people of the world, their sedition and corruption, and the uprising of all to extinguish the divine light of remembrance, from you and His loved ones this edifice hath become manifest and evident. This structure shall be accompanied by everlasting remembrance, for it was built in the name of God during the days of God and hath been adorned with the ornament of His approval. Beseech ye God that He may enable all to serve His Cause with steadfastness and to observe what God hath revealed in His Book. This world is evanescent; soon shall all return to nothingness, and there shall endure only that which hath been ordained by the Supreme Pen from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst mention concerning the bathhouse and the assistance of the friends in that land, this utterance hath been revealed from the Dayspring of divine revelation. His words, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>Blessed are they who have acted with goodness and who have arisen to serve the Cause in the days of God. Blessed are they who have labored and they who have rendered assistance. Convey to all of them greetings from the Wronged One and say: The recompense for goodly deeds is preserved and treasured with God. Rejoice in this most exalted Word. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Announcer, the All-Knowing. Every deed that appeareth today in the path of God is recorded as the sovereign of deeds in the Book of Names and is inscribed by the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they that act and blessed are they that understand. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The friends whose deeds are mentioned before the Divine Throne and whose praise floweth from the Tongue of Grandeur, by the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, such souls stand in the highest station and are accounted among the most exalted of creation in the sight of God. We hope from His grace and favor that He may enable this evanescent one and other gentlemen and friends to make up for what hath escaped us in the days of God. A whole world of tongues would be needed to make mention of that which is hidden from eyes. None is aware of the requirements of consummate wisdom. Verily our Lord, the All-Wise, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Another glad-tiding is that mention of your parents was made before His presence, and the word of forgiveness was uttered from the tongue of the All-Desired One. Verily doth the Servant praise Him and thank Him for the wondrous tokens of His grace and bounty unto him who hath turned unto Him and arisen to serve Him.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning thy wife and sister and others, it was laid before the Divine Throne. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in reply, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Give glad-tidings to thy wife on My behalf and make mention of her through My verses. Verily thy Lord answereth him who calleth upon Him, remembereth him who remembereth Him, and turneth unto him who turneth unto Him, as a token of His grace, for He is the Forgiving, the Generous. We have made mention of her and We have made mention of thy sister as a mercy from thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Blessed is the servant who hath believed in God on the Last Day, and blessed is the handmaiden who hath turned unto Him and attained unto the lights of the Throne whereon thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, is seated. Convey My greetings unto them both from the Wronged One, and unto those handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. How many a king have We found heedless of this Day, and how many a handmaiden hath attained unto this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped, save whom God hath willed, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Soon shall pass away that which the queens possess, and there shall endure that which hath been sent down for My handmaidens from the Ancient Revealer. The glory be upon thee and upon them and upon every handmaiden whom the clamor of the idolaters hath not kept back.</p>
<p>Grace upon grace, mercy upon mercy, bounty upon bounty, loving-kindness upon loving-kindness, are manifest and evident. What praiser can adequately render praise, and what thanksgiver can render sufficient thanks? Within each loving-kindness lie concealed a hundred thousand bounties, and for each bounty a hundred thousand thanks are required. God forgive this meaningless limitation! Nay, infinite thanks are not sufficient, let alone limited, numbered thanks. Who is able to thank Him as He deserves to be thanked? Who is able to praise Him as He deserves to be praised? Nay, by His very Self, all are powerless, all fall short.</p>
<p>In reference to what thou didst write concerning the testament of the departed, ascended, exalted leaf, the daughter of the sister of the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious – these words were heard in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, He Who was God and there was naught else besides Him. Blessed is she, for she hath drunk from the chalice of My love, soared in My atmosphere, spoken My praise, attained unto the hearing of My call, submitted to My Cause, and turned with her heart to My horizon. We make mention of her with such remembrance as shall cause the near ones to perceive the fragrance of eternity. To this beareth witness the Lord of all beings in this manifest Prison.</p>
<p>We have accepted from those related to the Leaf such deeds as have not yet come to pass. We have previously said: The intention of the believer is better than his deed. The intention of that honored lady, upon her be the Glory of God and His mercy, hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Blessed is she and joy be unto her. We have mentioned her before and make mention of her from this time forth. Every bearer of a name testifieth to My loving-kindness, My bounty, and My mercy, which encompasseth all who are in the heavens and on earth. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness unto her as it bore witness before – that she heard the call of her Lord, turned unto Him, and responded to her Master, the Mighty, the Generous. That which creation beholdeth cannot be compared with My testimony. To this beareth witness He Who proclaimeth in every state that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who readeth what hath been sent down for her from the heaven of My loving-kindness. We testify that he is among the triumphant ones. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon her and upon those who have turned to God when the Intended One came with a mighty command.</p>
<p>The mention of that company hath ever been, from the first day until now, in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. The servant beareth witness that they have attained unto that which hath been revealed in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. I beseech God to protect them and aid them in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Likewise, I convey greetings to each one, and with utmost humility and supplication, I request them to seek divine confirmation for this evanescent one, that he may perchance fulfill this mighty service.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding uncertainty about whether certain matters may be mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence – it is certainly permissible, nay rather, necessary, for judgment proceedeth according to what is apparent, and the affairs of the chosen ones, particularly those souls who are under the glance of divine favor, must assuredly be mentioned so that the decree may issue forth from the Source of the Cause.</p>
<p>The mention of his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, was made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. He saith, exalted be His glory and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer and the Answerer […]</p>
<p>This is a Remembrance from Us to one who has turned to God, the Lord of all worlds, that from My remembrance the fragrance of My loving-kindness may be diffused among My servants. Verily, I am the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen moveth at all times and maketh mention of the loved ones of the All-Merciful. Indeed, it is the Kawthar of Life amidst all created things. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto, and woe betide the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the precincts of the Throne - this place that hath been named the Most Great Prison in the Book of Names, and the Heaven of heavens in My perspicuous Tablet. Thou didst hear thy Lord’s call once from the Prison, and again from this Spot that hath been named the Most Exalted Paradise in the Crimson Scroll, which none hath understood save thy Lord, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We counsel thee with that whereby the Cause of thy Lord may be exalted, and with such deeds as the Concourse on High may bear witness unto. This behooveth thee and thy kinship with this momentous Announcement. We have heard thy call and have answered thee out of Our grace at this hour when the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh, and We make mention of him who hath held fast to His sure cord.</p>
<p>We heard thy call aforetime and sent unto thee that wherefrom the fragrance of My luminous garment was wafted. Beware lest the affairs of the world grieve thee. Leave them behind thee, placing thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Remember My loved ones on My behalf and give them the joyful tidings of this wondrous Remembrance. The Glory shining from the horizon of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whom neither the might of the world hath kept back from the Most Great Name, nor have the weapons of the nations frightened - they who denied God’s right and His Manifestation by following the sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Praise be to God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Here endeth that which was revealed for His honor Abu’l-Hasan. The splendor of God rest upon them both. His word, blessed and exalted is He:</p>
<p>He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! At this moment from the sighing of the fire of the Blessed Tree was heard this goodly word: By God! He who attaineth today unto one word from God hath attained unto all good. Blessed are they who attain! Beseech ye God that He may aid His servants, that perchance He may not deprive them of the waves of the ocean of meanings which in every instant speaketh forth through a book, and withhold them not from the lights of the Sun of Truth. This Wronged One hath accepted the tribulations of the world for the guidance of His servants, and there hath befallen Him that which none save God can reckon. Today it beseemeth all to make mention of the Beloved of all possibility with the utmost wisdom, eloquence, sanctity and detachment; and should they find a receptive soil, let them cast the Word therein, otherwise He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Powerful. The condition of the people of the earth is observed to be so base that the Supreme Pen hath uttered the previous word and reminded His loved ones of the words “Dissimulation is My religion and the religion of My forefathers.” Today it behooveth no one to confess before the faces of men. This is a command that hath been sent down anew from God, the Ancient Commander. O Baha! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Mention hath been made of thee before the Wronged One. We make mention of thee as We made mention of thee before. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the ear that hath attained unto the hearing of My utterance, and the servant who hath acted according to that which was sent down in My perspicuous Book. From this spot We send Our greetings unto thee and unto those who have believed in the One, the All-Informed, and We counsel you to perform pure deeds and to show forth such virtues as God hath made the cause of the attraction of His servants and the glory and honor of them that are turned unto Him. We make mention of those whom We have not mentioned in the Tablet and give them the glad-tidings of My grace, My mercy and My loving-kindness, and We counsel them with that which beseemeth the days of their Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. And We make mention of My handmaidens there and send Our greetings unto them from this far station. The glory of God be upon them from God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Here endeth that which was sent down from the Kingdom of the loving-kindness of our Bountiful Lord unto the people of the village. His word - exalted be His utterance and glorified be His grandeur - is: In My Name, the One Who ruleth over all names.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of those among the people of My village who heard, turned unto, and answered their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. We made mention of you before with such remembrance that when it issued forth from the mouth of My Will, the remembrances of the world bowed down before it. To this beareth witness he who possesseth the Manifest Book. This is the Day wherein the rivers of utterance have flowed forth in the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Blessed are ye for having hearkened unto the call of your Lord from the Most Exalted Horizon and turned unto Him with such submission as caused all created things to bow down, and beyond them every discerning soul. Beware lest the might of princes frighten you, or the denial of the ignorant who claim knowledge without clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, deter you. Take the chalice of utterance in the name of your Lord, the Most Merciful, then drink therefrom with the wisdom We have sent down in diverse Tablets and in this wondrous Tablet. This is the Cause at whose appearance the idols wailed, and every stubborn oppressor was thunderstruck. Blessed is he who hath spoken that which God hath testified, and blessed is he who hath heard that which hath been sent down from His mighty Kingdom. Thus hath the Tongue of Eternity spoken from His Most Great Prison, as a token of His grace unto those who have turned unto Him with radiant faces and have acted in accordance with that which they were bidden by God, the Mighty, the Great. O people of the village! Upon you be My Glory, upon you be My loving-kindness, upon you be My mercy throughout the eternity of My kingdom and My dominion, and the dwellers of the cities of My might which none hath discovered save he who proclaimeth at this moment that there is none other God but I, the Manifest Truth.</p>
<p>Here endeth what was revealed for his honor Mulla Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God. He - exalted be His grandeur - hath spoken:</p>
<p>He is the Witness from His most exalted horizon.</p>
<p>Today the Euphrates of divine mercy is flowing, and the heavenly Kawthar is streaming forth. The rays of the Sun of Truth have encompassed the world, and the call of unity has taken hold of all realities of existence. All the appointed times mentioned in the divine Books have been fulfilled, and the heavenly promises have been made manifest. The hidden secret and treasured mystery that lay concealed in the heart of the Holy Books has been revealed and made evident before the faces of all peoples in the gathering of the world. Yet the people’s attachment to self and desire has so veiled them that they remain heedless and unaware of all things. The Spirit of Truth continuously calls out from the highest horizon, heralding to creation the Sovereign of Revelation and the Speaker on Sinai, but love of the world has so encompassed them that they are deprived of hearing the call and forbidden from beholding the lights. Have they deemed these transient ornaments to be everlasting, or have they taken varying colors as their lords? Woe unto them and unto those who follow them without any clear proof from Us or evidence from Our presence. We testify that they are among the companions of the Fire.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Face! Rejoice in My remembrance of thee. By My life! Nothing in all creation can equal it. God will soon reveal the stations of those who have attained unto His remembrance, and will manifest in the realm of being whatsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.

From this spot We send Our greetings unto thee and unto him who was named Muhammad-Taqi, and We give him glad tidings of that which We have sent down for him from the heaven of Our mercy - the rain of My wondrous utterance.

We counsel thee to be patient and tranquil, and to that which will manifest the station of man in the contingent world. Thy Lord, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Let not the barking of every clamorous one who hath taken fancy as his lord instead of God cause thee to grieve. He is assuredly among the polytheists in the Book of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: By God! All the books of the world cannot equal that which We possess. Judge fairly within thyself, O heedless and veiled one! This is the Day whereon the Cock of the Throne hath crowed, and the Dove of Utterance hath cooed upon the branches, and the Bird of Proof hath warbled. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ghulam and counsel him to be steadfast in this Cause, at whose appearance the hearts of those who ascend the pulpits and occupy the chief seats were troubled. Place thy trust in all things in God and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast aided me to recognize Thy hidden Mystery, whereof Thou didst give glad tidings through the tongues of Thy Prophets and Chosen Ones in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, and Thy Tablets. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth. There is no God but Thee, the Everlasting, the Eternal, the Sovereign over the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>This lowly servant conveys his greetings and salutations to each of the people of the village and states that all must be engaged in service to the Cause with the utmost wisdom, and arise to make up for what has been lost, for other days are not possible. I beseech and implore God to preserve the deeds, actions and spiritual virtuous character of His friends in the treasuries of His protection and store them up for each one. He is the Just, and He is the Trustworthy. He Himself hath said: “Verily, He does not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.” Strive that there may appear from you such deeds as the extinction and forgetfulness of the mortal world cannot obliterate nor veil from sight. He is powerful and mighty over all things. Likewise, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for his honor Aqa Mulla Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may he be assisted to read it - by its reading hearts are gladdened and eyes are consoled. And concerning those servants of God and handmaidens who were enabled to pay the Rights of God and sent them - these were received. Praise be to God, they were confirmed in that which was revealed in the Book from the Supreme Pen. And some of the sent leaves attained their ultimate purpose and the Purpose of the world - that is, they were blessed by touching the Sacred Body. Blessed are those who sent them and those who wove them, and blessed are they themselves. Every single thing that attains the presence today has attained the fruit of its own existence. As commanded, convey greetings to each one and gladden them with words of acceptance. Glory, praise and exaltation be upon you and upon those who have attained the days of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God Himself hath testified: that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond mention and utterance, and exalted above the comprehension of all created things. All necks have bowed down before His grandeur and all names have prostrated themselves before His sovereignty. He hath shown the Way unto His loved ones and, through His bounty, grace, favor and generosity, revealed unto them the Proof. He it is Who, ere the creation of the heavens and earth, bore witness unto His own oneness and the singularity of His Being, and testified unto Him Who came with the Truth that He is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Book, and His irrevocable Decree. Through Him the Herald raised his call from every direction, the verses were sent down, the clear proofs appeared, the clouds spoke forth and rained upon all peoples. He it is Who hath stood in His place in all things and been established upon the throne of Revelation. Whoso acknowledgeth Him hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, and whoso denieth and turneth away is accounted among the wrongdoers in a Book which none but He hath seen. Thus hath He appeared and made manifest His Cause through His sovereignty, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the rivers have flowed and the mysteries been revealed! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy Tablets, and to Thy power before which all created things have bowed down, and Thy might which hath encompassed all contingent beings. O my Lord! Thou seest this servant of Thine who hath turned toward Thy most exalted horizon after hearing Thy sweetest call, and who standeth detached from all else but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, by Thy Command through which Thou didst transform the earth into heaven and caused all things to speak forth before the faces of humanity, to make me one of those whom the oppression of the oppressors and the tyranny of the transgressors - they who have cast behind them the choice wine of Thy utterance and the Kawthar of Thy bounty, and seized that which they were forbidden in Thy Book - hath not frightened. O my Lord! Thou seest the evanescent one desiring the cup of immortality in meeting Thee, the thirsty one Thy choice wine, the poor one the ocean of Thy riches, the weak one the horizon of Thy power, the stranger the pavilions of Thy grandeur, the oppressed one the deep ocean of Thy justice, the weary one the kingdom of Thy remembrance, the sick one the sea of Thy healing, the unlettered one the Mount of Thy knowledge and proof, the sleeping one Thy sweetest call, the naked one the robe of Thy grace, O Thou Who art the Possessor of the kingdom of names, and the sorrowful one the shore of the sea of Thy joy, O Lord of the Throne and earth! By Thy glory, O my God, my Goal and my Beloved! The heart findeth no rest save through the Day-Star of assurance from the direction of Thy grace, nor doth the eye become tranquil except by beholding the horizon of Thy manifestation, nor doth the soul find repose save through the appearances of Thy generosity and bounty. O my Lord! Thou seest me circling round Thy will and purpose, and submissive unto that which hath appeared from Thee. I beseech Thee by the suns of the heaven of Thy wisdom and the waves of the ocean of Thy grace to make me in all circumstances turned toward the lights of Thy countenance and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity. I testify that this Day is Thy Day, and the Command Thy Command, and the Light Thy Light. I beseech Thee by these to aid me in that which shall cause my remembrance to endure in Thy Book and my station among the people of Thy Kingdom. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, nor can the power of the wicked weaken. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest by Thy will. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O my Lord! Change Thou the hardship of Thy loved ones into ease, their difficulty into comfort, their abasement into glory, and their sorrow into the greatest joy, O Thou in Whose hand is the reins of mankind! Verily Thou art the Single, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of them who have recognized Thee!</p>

<p>Praise be unto Him Who speaketh, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar, upon thee be the Glory of God! Verily, We desire to remember and to recite that which We revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God: “Has not the time come for those who believe that their hearts should be humbled at the remembrance of God?” Glory be to God! In the days and nights divine verses and celestial evidences descend like the outpouring rain from the heaven of will. Nevertheless, all remain heedless save those whom the hand of divine power hath seized and delivered from the mire of idle fancies. Today hath appeared that which God’s Pen hath heralded and mentioned as glad tidings in all the Books of the past and future. What hath befallen the people that their ears are barred from hearing and their eyes deprived of witnessing? The divine Hand of bounty hath, in these luminous days, bestowed the choice wine of utterance and the fountain of true knowledge. No sincere seeker hath been denied a share of this most great bounty and supreme favor.</p>
<p>O people of God! This is the Day of joy and delight. In one of the Tablets these sublime words were revealed from the Supreme Pen: We say the day is the day of joy and delight. Joy from what? From the divine wine of the love of God in this spiritual morn. Blessed is the soul that hath sanctified itself with the living waters of the utterance of the Lord of all worlds and hath arisen with complete steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of all names–a steadfastness which neither the might of the enemy nor the wealth of the wicked can shake or deter from true constancy.</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! This Day is God’s Day. Cast behind you that which the people possess–their glory, their wealth, their power, their arts, their sciences, and their riches–and hold fast unto that which hath shone forth, gleamed, and diffused its fragrance from the horizon of the heaven of the Will of God, the Lord of all worlds. In truth I say: should anyone arise to promote the Cause solely for the sake of God, his word shall undoubtedly penetrate all things, his remembrance shall prevail, and his call shall encompass all. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Most Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His light! His honor Asad, upon him be My Glory, is present and hath repeatedly made mention of thee, seeking bounty from the True Bestower, and hath forwarded thy letters to the Most Holy Court. Every word thereof hath testified to thy devotion, steadfastness and service. Thou didst mention the resolution of certain matters - this hath been accepted and adorned with the honor of His good-pleasure. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee to exalt His Word amongst His heedless servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>In these days, without veil or hindrance, without delay or postponement, the Ship of Utterance moveth upon the sea of inner meanings. Say: O people of God! Turn ye unto Him. The Day is the Day of victory - deprive not yourselves. Glory be to God! Some heedless souls who have turned away are deprived of hearing the divine call and beholding the pearls and jewels from the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen. By what proof and evidence did they believe in the Herald, while remaining heedless and veiled from Him Who sent Him and from that which He revealed? Today all the Messengers cry out from the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven, saying: “O peoples of the earth! Purify yourselves from the promptings of self and desire, and set your faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Today He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation, and His call is raised from all directions.”</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Gird up the loins of service and occupy thyself with the mention and praise of the Intended One, that perchance those who are far may draw nigh, and those who are astray may find the path. That which hath appeared hath no parallel or likeness from the beginning of creation until now. Blessed is the ear that hath heard the call of God, the Self-Subsisting, and blessed the eye that hath beheld His Most Glorious, the Best-Beloved Countenance.</p>
<p>The Book of God speaketh before all faces, walking and giving glad tidings unto the servants concerning the horizon from which hath dawned the Sun of thy Lord’s grace, the All-Forgiving. Say: O company of the heedless! Leave what ye possess. By God! The Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty. Through Him the ocean of utterance hath surged, the breeze of divine knowledge hath wafted, and the mysteries of what was and what will be have been revealed. Behold! Behold! The river of proof hath flowed from His utterance, and the hidden treasure of God, the Mighty, hath appeared. By My life! Neither the doubts of those who have turned away from His Face, nor the allusions of every heedless and veiled one shall withhold Him.</p>
<p>Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My grace and mercy which have preceded existence, both seen and unseen. Say: Is there any doubt about God, or about that which hath been sent down from the clouds of His Will, or about His sovereignty which hath encompassed the hosts and ranks? Say: He desireth naught save to manifest the Cause of God, the Self-Subsisting, and to elevate your stations. To this testifieth He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in His mighty, treasured Book.</p>
<p>Say: O friends of God and His loved ones! Rejoice that your names have flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and your mention is preserved in His blessed, mighty and irrevocable Tablet. Thus hath the sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof, as a grace from God, the Revealer of this unfurled scroll. The glory that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon My loved ones and friends, and upon all who are firm, steadfast and hold fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention certain ones who speak without understanding. In reply it must be said: Praise be to God that among the people of truth there hath not been and is not anyone like that heedless, oppressive and mendacious soul. This is cause for gratitude, not complaint. His survival from the beginning until now is evidence of his hypocrisy, deceit and falsehood. For had he spoken with truthfulness, he would have ascended like the two luminous lights and the chosen ones before and after. By the life of God! He spoke from the pulpit of the land of Sad and in the presence of Ibn Shaykh Baqir that which inflamed the hearts of those near and sincere ones. Now reflect upon the martyrdom, sacrifice, submission and contentment of the assured and sanctified souls, and likewise upon the false and lying souls. Every day thou seest to what intrigues they cling - before the opposer claiming opposition, before the acceptor claiming faith. By the life of God! They have sullied the realm of truth and sincerity. Each day through some scheme he preserveth his troubled existence. Say: O friends! Today the Sun of Truth hath appeared and is manifest and speaking from the horizon of the heaven of the prison of Akka. Neither the oppression of tyrants, nor the assault of Pharaohs, nor the doubts of those who denied the Day of Judgment have deterred It. Praise be to God! We have not concealed ourselves for an instant. Without concealment or dissimulation have we proclaimed the Cause of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him believe, and whosoever wisheth, let him deny. Verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>In these days a new thought hath occurred to those false [treacherous] souls. They have intended to steal and erase the Book of God. Say: Woe unto you, O enemies of God and His Manifestation and His Cause! Fear ye God and be not among the oppressors. The Persian Bayan is a mighty book, for it indicateth and proveth the manifestation of Truth, exalted be His glory. In truth one is astonished. We beseech God to seize them with His might and prevent them through His sovereignty. O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance with His eyes! Words were previously uttered like unto the deluded faction who conversed with one of the companions. The assured one held fast to the Bayan. The other party mentioned that your Bayan is not correct. He said: Then bring forth that Bayan which you have. He said that too is not correct. He asked: Where is the correct Bayan? He replied: On the intended island. Now observe what an offensive odor emanateth from those words. We beseech God to aid them to return and be truthful, and to prosper them in turning towards the gate of His grace. Verily He is the Generous, the Munificent.</p>

<p>O ’Ali-before-Akbar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny. My Afnan, upon him be My glory, hath informed Me of thy departure and thy journey with him whom God hath loved. Blessed is he who hath attained to the recognition of the Intended One, and the seeker who hath turned unto Him in this wondrous and glorious Day. We have manifested the Cause, revealed the verses, and summoned all to God, the Lord of the worlds. Yet when God’s proof appeared and His evidence was made manifest, the people turned away and opposed it through their own evil doings. They are assuredly among the losers. Among the people are those who turned away, those who opposed, those who pronounced judgment, and those who shed blood at the bidding of every remote oppressor. They killed and plundered in such wise that grief overtook the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and those whom God made the inheritors of His exalted House. The more they increased in their wretchedness, the more did the Glory increase in manifesting His firm and mighty Cause. By God’s life! Nothing hath deterred Us, nor hath the oppression of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, caused Us fear.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Every deed performed for God’s sake shall be accepted. Work in the new land accordeth with wisdom, and the tongue of consultation hath confirmed it. Today all must arise with complete dedication to promote God’s Cause, but only when wisdom requireth it. In all cases, observe its requirements. For instance, silence is preferable to speech when wisdom so dictates, and likewise the reverse. In these days silence is nearer to piety, as its opposite causeth mischief. God, exalted be His glory, hath ever been and will continue to be mindful of His servants in all conditions.</p>
<p>O Akbar! May God willing, thou be assisted in that which exalteth the Cause of God. Whatsoever causeth tumult is unacceptable in the sight of the Wronged One. If a pure and holy land be found, deposit therein God’s trust, which is His Word. Otherwise, barren lands are not and never will be worthy. We have chosen wisdom and revealed it in the Book as a command from Us, and We are verily the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! For ages and centuries people have been enslaved by vain imaginings and idle fancies, bereft of understanding. Even after the manifestation of the Cause and the dawning of the Sun of Certitude, they remain heedless and unaware. They are oblivious to and deprived of the gate of mercy that hath been opened today before the face of all the worlds, yet they inquire about tales of the ancients. In truth, most ears are unworthy of this call, though this is the Day of hearing and seeing. All are deprived of hearkening and forbidden from beholding.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto God for the turning of the Ancient Beauty’s countenance toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and for His revelation of that which delighteth the eyes of the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and dawn. Praise God for having revealed for every name mentioned in thy book that which proclaimeth in the most exalted voice between earth and heaven and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the Final Return.</p>
<p>We make mention of the friends of God in Yazd and in Alif and Ra [Ardakan], and counsel them with that whereby His mighty and impregnable Cause may be exalted. O My friends in that land! Beware lest the affairs of men prevent you from the Truth. Cast aside what is with the people, clinging fast to God, the Lord of lords. Beware lest the might of the world frighten you. Take the chalice of steadfastness in the name of the Dawning-Place of the light of oneness, then drink therefrom with mention of His name, the Mighty, the Bestower. It behooveth you to manifest that which will cause the hearts to tremble of those who violated God’s Covenant and Testament, who denied His signs and rejected His proof and evidence, until they pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the clouds to lament. O people of Baha! The treacherous ones and clamourers have risen in opposition - those ignorant ones who appear in the garb of the learned. By God’s life! They have manifested such tyranny as no oppressor had ever intended before. From the days when the Day-Star of the horizons shone forth from the horizon of Iraq, We informed all of the appearance of the clamourers and birds of darkness. The people of truth must be so steadfast in the Cause that the entire world will find itself powerless to prevent them. In this Most Great Revelation all are commanded to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears. Whoso desireth to know Him, let him look with his own eyes. Thus hath the Tongue of the Bayan spoken in the Kingdom of wisdom. Blessed is he who hath heard and hastened and drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to My friends who have held fast to the cord of My loving-kindness and clung to the hem of My luminous robe. We make mention in this station of servants whose names were mentioned before, as a grace from Us upon thee and upon those who have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness in the days of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad ibn Ghulam! The Wronged One desireth to make mention of thee that thou mayest find the fragrance of utterance in the days of the All-Merciful and be of those who are assured. How many were the servants who considered themselves among God’s chosen ones and the noblest of creation, yet when the winds of tests moved even as much as the eye of a needle, they broke God’s Covenant and joined the hosts of polytheism. After divine recognition, steadfastness is necessary. O friends! Guard yourselves through the name of Truth from Satan’s hosts. Falsehood hath spread its snares in the name of truth. Fear God and be of those who are firmly established. We beseech God to preserve all from the putrid pool and guide them to the living waters. He is powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Ibrahim that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and be of those who stand firm in the Cause of his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O Ibrahim! Today the thirsty ones are turned toward the ocean of God’s loving-kindness and the rebellious ones toward the river of forgiveness. Blessed is the poor one who turned toward the horizon of wealth and the stranger who set his face toward the most exalted homeland. And blessed are those whom the whisperings of devils did not prevent from the manifest horizon, who arose with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of creation and spoke that which caused the denizens of the Supreme Paradise to rejoice. Blessed are they that have attained.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Asadu’llah and counsel him with My attributes and My character and with that whereby My mighty Cause may be uplifted. Take thou the Book of God with power from Him and be not of the patient ones. The promise hath come and the appointed time hath been fulfilled. The command is God’s, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the one standing firm whom Satan’s doubts did not cause to sit, and the steadfast one whom the signals of the rebellious did not cause to move, and the one who turned toward God whom the hosts of the oppressors did not frighten. Blessed is he who fulfilled God’s Covenant and Testament, and woe unto the violators. Beware lest vain imaginings veil thee or the traces of those who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, prevent thee.</p>

Verily We have given him and those who have believed the glad tidings of the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai, Who was promised in the Tablets of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Be thou steadfast and firm in the Cause of thy Lord and say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee for having created me and manifested me. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of what is with Thee. O Lord! Thou hearest the clamor of Thy servants and creatures and what the oppressors among Thy creation utter. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the prison of ’Akka. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord and be of them who render thanks. We have manifested Our Self and have sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance that which hath diffused the fragrance of the Ancient Garment throughout the world. Yet the peoples are in manifest loss. They have cast the Covenant of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies. Blessed is the strong one who hath broken the chains of allusions, and the one with insight who hath beheld what the Beloved beheld when He ascended to the Most Sublime Station by the command of the Ancient Ordainer.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of Muhammad-’Ali and give him the glad tidings of My remembrance of him, for I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Cast aside what the peoples possess and take what thou hast been commanded by God, the Mighty, the Peerless. Let not the power of princes weaken thee, nor the whisperings of the devils hinder thee. Hold fast unto the Most Great Handle and say:</p>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having remembered me, guided me and caused me to recognize Thee. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me what is with Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of ’Abdu’r-Rahim and counsel him with that which will manifest the station of man in the contingent world and that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We have called unto all, yet the people hear not; We have manifested the Supreme Horizon, yet most of the people see not. Say: Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and follow not vain imaginings and idle fancies. O people! This is a Day wherein the sun of certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s Will, the Mighty, the Loving. Be thou eloquent in My remembrance, turning unto My horizon, steadfast in the service of My Cause, and firm in My love, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus hath the Tree of Knowledge yielded the fruits of utterance. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto, and woe unto every obstinate infidel.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-’Ali! God willing, thou shalt lay an impregnable foundation from the pure iron of certitude and build a mighty bulwark that the Gog of passion may not overcome the hearts of the people of God nor find a way therein. Reflect upon the Most Great News. By the life of God! Thou shalt find thyself in joy and delight, then in rapture and bewilderment. Thy Lord is verily the Expositor, the All-Knowing. Thou wert mentioned before the Wronged One, but We have tarried in responding. The Most Exalted Pen hath been silent for a time, as a wisdom from Our presence. Thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The intoxication of pride hath seized the people and made them heedless of the Cause of God. In some lands, clamor hath been raised. The friends of God must protect themselves through His Name. Falsehood, clothed in the garment of truth, preventeth the people from the straight path, for were it to appear in its own garment, none among the servants would turn unto it. Hold fast unto the cord of the Name of thy Lord and be of them who are steadfast. Say: […]</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things, not to disappoint me of that which is with Thee, and not to make me one of those who turned toward Thee and then turned away, and who believed and then denied. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the destiny of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! For each of those souls whom thou didst previously mention, wondrous verses have now been sent down and dispatched from the Kingdom of the favors of God, glorified be His majesty. The delay therein was due to wisdom, and the reason is manifest and evident. Beseech God to preserve all His servants, to keep them steadfast in His Cause, and to confirm them in such deeds as will lead to its exaltation. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to thy intention to turn toward the Dawning-Place of divine verses, there hath been and is no objection to its achievement in a spirit of joy and delight. However, thou must be mindful of wisdom and not let slip the requirements of the time. Thus hath commanded He Who hath been the Ruler from time immemorial. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have arisen and said: “We believe in God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>The fragment of the Tablet that has been received shall be taken as fully authentic. The Almighty shall grant all that which they seek. Every matter hath been set down in His perspicuous Book. Every soul that turneth humbly toward God shall find his prayers answered and his needs fulfilled. For He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and His knowledge encompasseth all things. […]</p>

<p>O My brother who has been named Radi - may God increase his glory and honor! - He is manifest upon the throne of grief. These are verses of the Command revealed from the heaven of eternity, which none understand except those who have soared on wings of detachment to an exalted heaven. In them is that which severs the hearts of the Messengers and causes tears to flow down illumined holy cheeks. Whoso God opens the eye of the Command will witness every letter of these verses upon the human temple. Blessed be God Who has manifested him in the most beauteous form. The chambers of words weep with crimson tears, which none know save those endowed with insight. In them is mentioned My loved one whom God has related to My Self - this is God’s bounty to him, were he to be aware of it.</p>
<p>O My brother! Hear the call of thy Lord from the direction of the Throne, then turn to Him with pure and lofty hearing, that thou mayest become aware of the mysteries of the Command in these days when souls are wrapped in thick veils of fancy. Hearken to what the Spirit imparts to thee from the direction of the Throne, then rend asunder the veils with holy and mighty fingers, that thou mayest enter behind the veil and witness that which will refresh thine eyes and gladden thy heart, for behind it is what no creatures have comprehended. By God, O My brother, wert thou to look with the eye of the spirit thou wouldst witness the Kingdom of God circling round the words of these verses which have been sent down from an exalted heaven of glory. It weeps for itself and its dwellers weep for what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty from those who opposed God after being created by His command. Thus was the matter recorded by the Holy Pen in the Mother Book. Behind it the eyes of God weep at the ultimate station with a cry that would shatter the pillars of every knowing one. Thereby all atoms weep, and all who have entered beneath the shadow of the names and attributes. Thus do We inform thee of the truth that thou mayest possess wondrous knowledge.</p>

And blessing and peace be upon the Hands of His Cause, through whom His commandments and laws were spread among His servants, and through whom was revealed that which was hidden in knowledge and treasured in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Ali, upon thee be My everlasting glory! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto that which hath been revealed in the perspicuous Book from the Pen of the Will of the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We bear witness to thy turning and devotion in days when most of the people of the world were observed to be heedless and in denial. This Day is God’s Day, and this Cause His Cause. Happy is he who hath renounced this world, and clung to Him Who is the Dayspring of God’s Revelation. We beseech God to assist thee to serve His Cause with wisdom and utterance.

Blessed art thou, O Ali, in that thou hast acknowledged in His days that which was revealed in His mighty and wondrous Book.</p>

Strengthen my limbs through Thy strength and Thy sovereignty and Thy might and Thy power, in such wise that the happenings of the world shall not prevent me from Thy remembrance and Thy praise.

<p>O Haydar-’Ali! O ’Ali-Haydar!</p>
<p>Glad tidings We give unto all eyes, and We exhort you: Withhold not yourselves from beholding the signs of the Purpose of the world and the Lord of nations. This Day is your day, for ye have been brought from nothingness into being for the sake of sight, and the purpose of this sight, in its primary station and foremost rank, hath been and is the witnessing of the signs of God. And unto all ears We give glad tidings: Deprive not yourselves of the outpourings of the True Bestower in these divine days. There hath been and is no doubt that ye were created to hearken unto the Call, and the purpose of this hearkening, as set forth in the Qayyumu’l-Asma, is to hear this Call which is raised from the Supreme Horizon at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>Peerless is this Day, for it is as the eye to past ages and centuries, and as a light unto the darkness of the times. In truth, days that are deprived of the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Truth are accounted as nights, nay, as darker still. Thus hath spoken the Lord of Eternity when sorrows encompassed Him from those who cast the Trust behind their backs and spoke that which caused Truth to lament and wrought that which made Zion cry out.</p>
<p>The loved ones of God have known and do know that this Wronged One, having regard to the pillar of faithfulness which is accounted as the greatest of pillars in the sight of the Lord of all possibilities, sought to aid and support His Majesty the Shah. However, from another station and a different horizon did the Luminary of victory and triumph shed its radiance. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Manifestation through which the Prophets and Messengers arose and whereby Thou didst raise the standard of “There is none other God but Thee” upon the most exalted station of existence, to adorn the Shah of Iran with the lights of grace and beneficence. O Lord! Aid him in pure justice that through it the horizons of Thy dominion may be illumined. Then inspire him, O my God, with that which Thou desirest for the elevation of his station and the preservation of his realm. O Lord! Through Thy mercy make him successful, then preserve him through the hosts of Thy invisible realm that he may arise to exalt Thy Word amongst the kings of Thy earth unto whom Thou hast entrusted the affairs of Thy creation. O Lord! Increase his power, his sovereignty, his might, and his strength that he may rule among Thy servants according to what Thou hast commanded him in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>This wronged people must, by day and by night, pray for and seek after the justice of His Majesty the Shah. However, God hath manifested what He desired and will manifest what He willeth. Assuredly, the justice of His Majesty the Shah of Iran is most excellent and beloved for its people. But as for the horizon from which in these days the light of justice hath dawned, its reward and recompense must not be effaced from the sight of God’s loved ones. The essence of all heavenly Books beareth witness and proclaimeth the recompense of those who do good and act aright. We beseech God to aid you in carrying out that which ye have been commanded by His Most Exalted Pen. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>It is not permissible to turn to foreign powers. This is what the Wronged One hath decreed in His perspicuous Book. Since your wishes and prayers are for the sake of God, assuredly upon His Majesty - may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him - will shine forth the Luminary of justice.</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Assist him to perpetuate his name in Thy Book and to elevate his station among Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the One Who chooseth.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My everlasting Baha! The gate of grace is opened and the river of bounty is flowing from the Divine Pen. Grace hath reached such heights that were any of the atoms of creation to be asked “To whom belongeth grace?”, they would respond “To God, the Lord of Lords!” Give thou glad tidings of His favors to the loved ones of God and make them aware of His infinite grace, lest the croaking of frogs sadden them. Under all conditions, hold fast to the cord of mercy and regard all with grace. Ye are the flowing rivers that branch from the Most Great Ocean; ye must sacrifice yourselves for the advancement of the world.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Haydar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Destiny! Though outwardly thou hast fallen into hardship, inwardly thou art in the station of the cloud of mercy, for the signs of trustworthiness, religion, chastity, truthfulness and sincerity have been spread through thee to all parts of the world. The description of this station is beyond expression. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all beings. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. Say: We counsel you to perform deeds by which the world will be illumined. Hold fast to the hem of justice and grasp the cord of wisdom. The hatred and animosity of the people in these days stem from ignorance and lack of understanding; otherwise, if they were to discover your purpose and mission, all would openly and secretly circle round you in adoration. Verily, He knoweth and speaketh, while people speak but know not.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Specifically regarding the sons of Khalil in the land of Ha and Mim: Some time ago, holy Tablets were revealed from the heaven of will and were sent forth. If all the peoples of the world were to attain but one drop from the concealed oceans within the divine words, they would detach themselves from all they possess, such that neither the world’s possessions, ornaments, nor colors would deprive them from the News of God or prevent them from the fruits of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Your judgment that the mentioned person should not become involved in the affairs of ’Ayn and Shin was sound. Well done! Your opinion in this matter hath been adorned with the ornament of divine acceptance.</p>
<p>And concerning the compilation of Tablets from your previous Tablet, and from Ishraqat, Tarazat, Tajalliyat, and others, as well as from Tablets containing prohibitions against the sword, corruption and conflict, and such as the Tablet of Burhan, and Tablets speaking of love, fellowship and the unity of all - which you mentioned - this intention is blessed, encompassing and effective, and is truly considered and reckoned among the mightiest of deeds before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed are they who act! God willing, may the mentioned scribe be assisted to write that which is the cause of permanence and the means of tranquility for the peoples of the world. We have indeed mentioned the sons of Khalil in various Tablets, and the son of him who was named Yahuda, and through their mention We have kindled a fire in the upraised Tree in the Most Exalted Paradise [which proclaimeth] that there is none other God but He, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Convey My greetings to them and give them glad tidings of that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of the Tablet through the light of their Lord’s grace, the All-Forgiving, the Generous. We beseech God to assist them and strengthen them in such steadfastness as would cause the limbs of the polytheists to quake.</p>
<p>Make mention of Hadi Dawlat-Abadi - in truth he hath not attained unto a single drop from the ocean of fairness. We have made mention of the loved ones of the land of Qaf and Mim in numerous Tablets. God willing, may they attain unto the honor of steadfastness. Hadi hath manifested oppression and striveth diligently to lead people astray. Thou didst mention the names of the loved ones of the land of Qaf and Mim - a special Tablet was revealed and sent for each one. We beseech God to make the souls in that land as firm, steadfast and unmoveable as mountains. The Two Rivers have flowed from the beginning of days until now; they have surpassed most of the servants in their acceptance and their turning toward God - to this beareth witness the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Hadi’s books of doctrine. Glory be to God! From the day they attributed to him the name of Babi until now, he hath found no rest, preserving his worthless life through all manner of schemes and devices. Nevertheless, he hath perpetrated against the knights in the arena of detachment that which no oppressor hath ever done. Convey My greetings to the people of Sihdih. Say: O people! Behold the signs of God, His mercy, His glory, His grandeur and His power, and remember that which hath appeared from Me. I stood in the earliest days before the faces of the world and conveyed unto the princes, divines and mystics that which I desired for the reformation of the world and the advancement of nations, such that I concealed not My face for less than a moment. Then consider those who have spent their wealth and lives in My path - neither riches, nor ornaments, nor glory prevented them. They advanced to the place of sacrifice with radiant faces and attained unto the Kawthar of detachment and spending in the love of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Hadi, like one of the divines of the Furqan, is occupied with organizing a party like the Shi’ih. Call the people by the power of God, then follow the path of those whom neither the might of the oppressors, nor the power of the aggressors, nor all the armies of the earth could deter. Thus doth the Supreme Pen remind you in its Most Great Prison that ye may know and be of the thankful. We hope that all may be set ablaze by the breezes of revelation and the fire of the Word, and be illumined by the light of the Cause.</p>
<p>The schemes and plots of Siyyid Mahdi Najaf-Abadi were evident before the Most Holy Court. We had previously revealed verses for him whereby the cities of wisdom, utterance, knowledge and mystic truth were perfumed, and whereby the hearts of those near unto God were attracted. Glory be to God! Like a solid rock, he was not and is not capable of hearing the Word of God. Say: O Mahdi! The verses have encompassed all directions and the sun of clear proofs hath shone forth before the faces of all parties. If thou deniest God’s grace and His verses, and God’s proof and His evidence, by what means canst thou establish that which thou hast, and by what proof dost thou call people to your delusions and idle fancies? We testify that he hath not known the Way nor the Guide. He followeth his own desires just as the people followed their desires. Lo! He and those with him are among the most lost in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Your servant praises You for having mentioned the name of Allah-Jim and likewise their steadfastness in the Cause of Truth, exalted be His glory. In these days there hath been sent down from the heaven of grace that which cannot be equaled by the pearls of the oceans of utterance and knowledge. Today all must occupy themselves with bringing hearts together and hold fast to that which God hath willed. We send greetings to him from this station and give him glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for him from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The Hands of the Cause are each remembered before the Wronged One, and these few must, by day and by night, strive with wisdom and utterance to foster love and unity. Thus hath God decreed in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! At every moment when signs of the exaltation of the Cause appeared somewhat, the unfair ones of the world emerged from behind the veils and did that which ye have heard and seen. Where is fairness and where is justice? Were it not for the Glory (Baha), who could stand before the faces, and who could speak amidst the parties? God knoweth that the calumniators and the clamorous ones know and recognize that We have raised up the Cause through a power from Us and a sovereignty from Our presence, yet they deny it, following their idle fancies and vain imaginings. We beseech God to return the liars and calumniators to the ocean of truthfulness. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower, the Glorious, the Wise.</p>
<p>The journey of Muhammad Isma’il was approved beforehand, and We also give permission to Haji Siyyid Asadu’llah, provided wisdom so requires. And if they travel by another route it would be more beloved and preferable, for in that great city the calumniators and traitors lie in wait, casting doubt and suspicion in every heart, even though the treachery of these souls hath been proven and demonstrated to the people of that city.</p>
<p>O Haydar! Upon thee be My Baha! Some time ago a special Tablet was revealed for the son of the martyr, upon them both be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and in that Tablet mention was made of the martyr who sacrificed his life in the path of God, and We revealed for him that whose fragrance shall not cease and whose traces shall not change, and that which was ordained therein. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Care for the son is incumbent upon all. He must surely engage in some profession or occupation lest he remain without effect and fruit. Praise be to God Who hath adorned his head with the crown of My name and his temple with the ornament of My kinship, and We beseech Him to aid him to preserve this most exalted station and most glorious dwelling place.</p>
<p>We are saddened by what has befallen the son of Abhar through the firm decree. Verily she had station and rank before God. We have mentioned her before and mention her at this time: O My handmaiden and My leaf! I testify that thou didst turn when the Call was raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, and with thy right hand thou didst take the Kawthar of contentment and with the other the Salsabil of eternity, and thou didst drink from them once in My Most Exalted Name and again in My Most Glorious Name. We testify that thou didst bear hardships and tribulations in the path of God, the Lord of the Throne and earth. The turning away of the handmaidens did not prevent thee, nor their malicious joy, nor what issued from their mouths. I testify that thou didst outstrip most of the servants, let alone the handmaidens, and didst turn to the horizon of the Manifestation when the men of the regions turned away from it. The first light that shone from the ocean of light and the first radiance that dawned from the horizon of Sinai be upon thee, O handmaiden of God, the King of the Day of Resurrection. Thou art she who answered the call of thy Lord and attained unto His verses and His traces and what appeared from His presence. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to rain down upon thee from the clouds of His grace the rain of His mercy, and to ordain for thee the reward of those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn, and in the morning and at sunset. O My leaf! Thou art in the Most Glorious Horizon and the Wronged One mentioneth thee in the prison of Akka. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee. Rejoice, O My handmaiden, in this mention which, when it issueth from My mouth, causeth the ocean of forgiveness to surge and the fragrance of mercy and bounty to waft from the presence of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who turneth unto thee and mentioneth thee with that which the Tongue of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, hath spoken. The glory from Us be upon thee, and the light from Us be upon thee and upon whomsoever draweth nigh unto thee and presenteth himself before thy resting-place and visiteth thee according to what hath been sent down from God, the Possessor of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>The mention of Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be My glory, hath been and is before the Most Holy Court, and what thou hast mentioned regarding his stations of attraction, yearning, enkindlement and teaching hath attained unto the honor of being heard. It is hoped that with pure detachment and utmost sanctity he will be occupied with teaching the Cause of God. Verily We have heard his mention and his call in this firm Cause, and We were with him in the gatherings and assemblies. Thy Lord verily heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Some time ago the answer to Ibn-i-Abhar’s questions was sent down from the heaven of bounty and dispatched, but it hath not arrived. We beseech God to honor him with it and cause him to attain unto meeting with it.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Ask of the Truth to raise up souls who, detached from the world, will arise to assist the Wronged One, and to confirm the existing Hands of the Cause in that which will cause the servants to enter into the depths of the ocean of true unity. The Son of Mary saith: “O sheep of God! I send you forth amidst wolves. When ye depart from one land intending to proceed to another, let not even the dust of that land remain upon your garments.” However, in view of the changes in means and people, one must reflect upon and act according to what befitteth the day.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the mindlessness of certain deniers of the Bayan. In truth, thou speakest aright. The Point (the Bab), may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake, with loudest voice doth plead and with utmost humility doth declare: “On that Day, be not veiled by the Bayan.” Nevertheless, Hadi Dawlat-Abadi, meeting with every seeker, attempts to lead them astray by citing passages from the Bayan, heedless that in that very moment he is engaged in opposition to His Holiness. Beseech the Lord of existence to grant him fairness. Glory be to God! They believe in the precursor yet turn away from the source; they acknowledge the herald yet remain veiled from the Sovereign of the Manifestation. In truth, this is the station of this most exalted Word. O Haydar-’Ali! These impure hands were not and are not worthy to grasp His most holy and pure hem.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Do Thou raise up one from Thy presence who will remember Thee and aid Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Answerer, Thou art the Hearer, Thou art the All-Knowing. There is no God but Thee, the Helper, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Mirza Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be My Baha. We have indeed mentioned him in diverse stations, and We beseech God to protect him and His loved ones from every remote oppressor and every sinful transgressor. We counsel all the loved ones to show forbearance and wisdom, and to that which attracts hearts and souls. In all conditions We have forbidden whatsoever giveth rise to clamor and kindleth the fire of hatred, for most people are ignorant and unaware of the purpose, and thus become inflamed.</p>
<p>The sacred month of Mu?arram hath ever been revered, and ultimately, through the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs (Imam Husayn), peace be upon him, it attained the most exalted station and highest rank. And in this Revelation, by virtue of the appearance of the Primal Point (the Bab) and His birth, it hath acquired yet another station. From the first arose lamentation, cry and wailing, and from the second, joy and gladness. However, this matter is known and evident to the people of God, while hidden and concealed from others. Therefore, in view of God’s mercy which hath preceded all and His divine grace and bounty, the people of God should observe the sanctity of those days. The Primal Point Himself also observed its sanctity.</p>
<p>In closing, We hope that the loved ones of God will hold fast to that which draweth the peoples together and likewise causeth the reformation of the world and its nations. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace and bounty be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have cast away that which they were forbidden and acted according to that which they were commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>

<p>We are lovers of Thy face, frequenters of Thine abode, fastened to Thine hair.</p>
<p>Thy decree, I desire. Thy favour, I desire. May all souls be offered up for Thy sake.</p>
<p>Hark! Beg it from God. Hark! Beg it from Baha.</p>
<p>We are gazelles of Thy desert, fishes of Thy river, seekers of Thy way.</p>
<p>Thy Beauty, I desire. Thy Majesty, I desire. May all souls be offered up for Thy sake.</p>
<p>Hark! Beg it from God. Hark! Beg it from Baha.</p>
<p>We are bound for Thy mansion. We circumambulate Thy city. We are servants of Thy Cause.</p>
<p>Thy Light, I desire. Thy Blessing, I desire. May all souls be sacrificed for Thy sake.</p>
<p>Hark! Beg it from God. Hark! Beg it from Baha.</p>
<p>We are killed by Thy love, extinguished in our separation from Thee, annihilated in Thy Name.</p>
<p>Thy trials, I desire. Thy decree, I desire. May all souls be offered up for Thy sake.</p>
<p>Hark! Beg it from God. Hark! Beg it from Baha.</p>
<p>We are birds tamed by Thee, we are fish in Thy net, we are cup-bearers of Thy chalice;</p>
<p>I desire Thy faithfulness, I desire Thy persecution, O I sacrifice myself for Thee!</p>
<p>Seek thou from God, seek thou from Baha!</p>
<p>We are wanderers in Thy prison, we are guardians of Thy Egypt, we are treasurers of Thy mystery;</p>
<p>I desire Thy call, I desire Thy air, souls are scattered for Thee!</p>

<p>We are drinkers of Thy cup, we are bearers of Thy throne, we are observers of Thy treasure;</p>
<p>I desire Thy praise, I desire Thy melody, O I sacrifice myself for Thee!</p>
<p>Seek thou from Baha, seek thou from God!</p>
<p>We are enchanted by Thy glance, we are keepers of Thy treasure, we are cognizant of Thy mystery;</p>
<p>I desire Thy motto, I desire Thy protection, souls are sacrificed for Thee!</p>
<p>Seek thou from God, seek thou from Baha!</p>
<p>O Furughiyyih, this Tablet reached the lady and now reacheth thee. Give thanks unto the Desired One of the world that He hath crowned thee with the crown of nearness. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this great bounty.</p>
<p>O lady! The Truth sometimes speaketh in the tongue of the people. This very leaf is witness and proof thereof. We commanded the servant present to write and send it. The glory be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Praise be sanctified above the mention of all created things unto the Manifestation of evident signs, Who befitteth and deserveth it, Who hath conquered contingent being through utterance. In the realm of lovers He is the Manifestation of Beauty, and in the world of perfection the Dawning-Place of the knowledge of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. He hath bestowed the water of life upon the thirsty and granted eternal life unto the dead. The denial of the divines hindered Him not, nor did the turning away of princes hold back His purpose. He hath rolled up the carpet of idle fancies and locked fast the world of vain imaginings. With utmost expansion He spread out a new carpet and summoned the drinkers of the Kawthar of certitude, bestowing upon each from His hand the chalice of immortality. Whosoever attained thereunto beheld himself detached from the world and all who dwell therein. At this station the effulgences of the lights of the Most Exalted Word “Verily He doeth what He willeth” shine forth and entirely take possession of the world of being. This power is not diminished by the ranks of hatred, nor are the hosts of names an obstacle thereunto. By the cord of grace He drew those who were detached from the gulf of names unto the ocean of inner meanings. How lofty is the station of that being who hath attained unto this bounty, and how great the rank of that soul who hath won this most pure sustenance and this most great favor! Such a one beholdeth the people of the world as non-existent and seeth naught but the Truth. The croaking of the croakers hath not nor ever shall have any access to this arena. The tyrants and pharaohs - that is to say, the divines and doctors of the earth - are not mentioned at this station. He beholdeth the Peerless Friend Who hath come from the horizon of power bearing the banner “Verily He is God.” And whosoever hath found the fragrance of the Word of God hath attained unto true wealth and been adorned with the supreme ornament. Blessed are they who know, blessed are they who drink, and blessed are they who are detached!</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of all beings and Educator of all things possible! I beseech Thee by Thy greatest signs and the breezes of Thy Revelation, O Lord of all mankind, and by Thy power which hath conquered all things, and by Thy will which hath subdued all names, to assist Thy loved ones to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause. Then aid them in that whereby Thy Being may be sanctified and Thy Reality glorified. O Lord! Thou seest him who hath turned unto Thee in numbered years and hath arisen to serve Thy Cause among Thy servants and Thy creatures, and hath testified to Thy oneness and singleness and to that which hath flowed from the Pen of Thy Command and been uttered by the Tongue of Thy grandeur. Assist him, O my God, with the hosts of wisdom and utterance that he may subdue hearts through Thy Name and open the doors of souls with the key of Thy remembrance. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and King of eternity, by Thy Most Great Prison, to strengthen him with the legions of power and might, then inscribe for him by Thy Most Exalted Pen that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of Thy names and attributes. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Send down Thy blessings, O my God, upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones who broke not Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and who spoke among Thy servants that which draweth them nigh unto Thee and guideth them unto Thy path, and who heard in Thy path the taunts of Thine enemies, and who were visited in their love for Thee by that which caused the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy protection to lament. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>I render praise that thy precious letter was received - both the previous and subsequent ones - each attesting to that spiritual friend’s acceptance, orientation and steadfastness in the Cause of the Desired One of the world. After reading and becoming apprised thereof, on this occasion it was taken to the Most Exalted Presence and the Supreme Height, presented before His countenance and achieved the honor of His hearing. These are His blessed and exalted words:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>This is a mention from Us to him who heard the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, who turned his face and advanced with his heart toward the Supreme Horizon - the Station wherein the Lote Tree of the Uttermost Boundary called out from the pole of the Most Exalted Paradise: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords!” - that the remembrance and praise might once again draw him to the Most Exalted Paradise, this Station whereon the Ancient Beauty and the Most Great Announcement was established upon the Throne with power and sovereignty. We have named this Station at times the Most Great Prison, at others the Most Exalted Paradise, and yet again the Supreme Paradise and the Heaven of heavens. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>We have mentioned thee time and again and have revealed for thee that which hath made the skin of the idolators to quiver and hath delighted the eyes. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He hath come from the horizon of might with the banners of signs. He stood before the faces of princes and divines, speaking that which caused all in the heavens and earth to swoon, save those whom God preserved through a power from Him and guided to the straight path. Each day there hath befallen Us that which hath caused the Tablet to lament and the Pens to cry out. We desired for them life, while they desired to shed the blood of the Wronged One without proof or scripture.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the earth! By God, the horizons of the world have been illumined by the lights of the Manifestation. Draw nigh with radiant hearts and follow not every doubtful idolator. This is the Cause foretold in God’s Books of old. Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an and in the Scrolls, Psalms and Tablets. By the life of God! No Manifestation hath appeared except that He took My Covenant before His own, and no Book hath been revealed except that the fragrance of My mention and praise wafted therefrom. The Mother Book in the Final Return beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful, then judge with fairness concerning this Cause, at Whose appearance the verses bowed down in submission. Fear God, O people, and deny not Him through Whom the Trump was blown, the Bridge was set up, the heaven was cleft asunder and the mountains were moved. Say: Where were ye when they bound Me with chains and fettered Me with that which caused hearts to melt?</p>
<p>Remember My loved ones on My behalf, remind them of My verses, illumine them with the lights of My utterance, and give them the glad tidings of the heaven of My grace and mercy which hath preceded all who are in earth and heaven. Say: O friends of God in all lands! Take heed lest the clamor of the nations frighten you or the might of the wicked hinder you. Arise to aid the Cause through wisdom and utterance. Thus have ye been commanded in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords. Hasten to what pleaseth God - this is better for you. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this: There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hearken unto the call of Him Who is wronged. He hath remembered thee time and again, and hath given thee to drink from the Kawthar of divine knowledge through the hands of grace and bounty, and hath taught thee that which the servants were prevented from knowing. Blessed is he whom the might of those who disbelieved in God and broke the Covenant on the Day of Meeting could not weaken, and blessed is he whom the power of the servants could not hold back from standing, and blessed is he whom the clamor of the foolhardy could not silence from speaking. Thus hath the Pen of God revealed the pearls of wisdom and utterance, and thus hath the Most Great Ocean revealed that which was concealed within it, from God, the Cleaver of Dawn.</p>
<p>When thou art inebriated with the wine of My utterance and the waves of the ocean of My knowledge, say: My God, my God! Thou seest me advancing toward the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, and turning my face to the lights of Thy countenance on a day whereon most of Thy servants and creatures have turned away from Thee. I am he, O my God, whom Thy most sweet call and the sound of Thy Most Exalted Pen have attracted, in such wise that neither the happenings of the world nor the doubts of the nations have hindered me. I have laid hold on Thy strong cord and Thy mighty announcement wherewith Thou didst give glad tidings in Thy Books and through Thy Messengers.</p>
<p>By Thy glory, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the mystics and the Beloved of the souls of them that are nigh unto Thee! The waves of the ocean of my hope can be stilled only by the light of meeting Thee, and the sorrow of my heart can be dispelled only by standing before Thy face. My God, my God! Thou hearest the cry of the lovers in their separation from Thee, and beholdest the yearning of them that long for Thee in their remoteness from Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy command whereby Thou hast subdued both the unseen and the visible, that Thou ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have, by Thy leave, attained unto the stations of nearness and reunion and meeting, until they stood before a door which opened upon all who are in earth and heaven. Strengthen me to remember Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause and to stand before Thy face and to enter a station round which circle the Highest Paradise and the denizens of the all-highest heaven.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! I know not what Thou hast ordained for me by Thy binding command and Thy firm decree. By Thy glory! Because of this my liver hath melted, my limbs have trembled, and my whole being hath been shaken. Alas, alas! Should the decree of destiny prevent me from attaining unto Thy presence, O Lord of all being, I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy oneness and the lights of the sun of Thy grace and the mysteries that lay hidden in the treasuries of Thy Books and Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets, that Thou write down for me, with the Pen of Thy bounty, the recompense of meeting Thee. O Thou at Whose finger’s motion Thy earth and Thy heaven are set in motion! I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in every world of Thy worlds, and to provide me with the good of the hereafter and of this present life. Verily Thou art the Lord of all names and the Creator of the heavens.</p>
<p>O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! O Lord! Dispel the grief of Thy loved ones and Thy chosen ones, and remove their anguish through Thy power and might, and illumine their hearts with the lights of the Day-Star of Thy oneness. Then send down upon them, from the heaven of Thy bounty, the rain of Thy mercy. Thou art indeed the Almighty, unto Whose power all created things have testified, and all things possible have witnessed to Thy strength and Thy conquest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We have desired to change from the most eloquent tongue to the luminous tongue, that God’s favor to thee, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, may be completed, and His grace may be manifested once again, that thou mayest give thanks to Him by night and by day, at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>Today it is incumbent upon all to arise for the promotion of the Cause of God and engage in such deeds as lead to the exaltation of His Word. Today the river of divine mercy is flowing and the ocean of utterance of the All-Merciful is surging; the Balance is set up and the Path made clear; the proof is revealed. Yet the people of the world are seen to be veiled. Each day the cry of the Calf is raised. Beseech ye God that He may guide the people of the Bayan and protect them from whatsoever causeth division, that all may hold fast unto unity and concord. Unity hath ever been and will continue to be the cause of the exaltation of the Word. Praise be to God that whatsoever leadeth to strife, conflict and corruption hath been strictly forbidden in the Books and Tablets. The triumph of God’s Cause hath been and will ever be achieved through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. From the beginning of days this exalted Word hath shone forth from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen: blessed is he who hath attained unto that which beseemeth the Day of God. Your honor should inform and give glad-tidings to the loved ones in that land and its surroundings of that which hath dawned forth from the Dayspring of the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Awaken those who slumber and make mindful those who are heedless, that perchance they may become aware of that for which they were created and act as beseemeth them. We beseech God that all may drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness in such wise that no thing among all things, no matter among all matters, and no tale among the tales of the ancients and the moderns may withhold them from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Say: Know ye the value of these days. Today He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Manifestation and speaketh forth. Whosoever drinketh from the Kawthar hidden within the blessed words “He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth” shall find himself established upon the throne of certitude. This blessed Word shall guide the seekers to the ocean of faith and draw those who search unto the horizon of certitude. He shall see naught but God and regard all else as non-existent. Well is it with them that attain thereunto, blessed are they that drink thereof. Ask thou God to assist His loved ones and aid them to recognize this most exalted station and to succeed in that which draweth them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And We beseech Him, exalted be He, to manifest through thee that which attracteth the hearts and souls and guideth them to a station wherein the hosts of doubts and allusions shall not prevent them, nor shall they be frightened by the ranks of those who have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to their own idle fancies and vain imaginings. Make mention of the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One. By the Sun of Utterance which shineth from the horizon of the heaven of proof, the men and women who have turned towards God have been and are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One, and there hath been ordained for the steadfast men and steadfast women that which the world is powerless to mention. Thus hath the Tongue of the Wronged One spoken in His Most Great Prison, that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who render thanks.</p>
<p>Praised be God, the breezes of the All-Merciful’s utterance have wafted upon that spiritual friend from all directions. If the people of the world were in truth to attain unto but one word from the Book of Equity or the Volume of Justice, all would turn from what they possess to that which is with God. O beloved of my heart! The gate of equity is barred and the path of justice forbidden. The recompense of the nations’ deeds hath deprived them of the immortal waters and kept them from the straight path. They witness the divine verses descending like the spring rains and hear them, yet they deny and turn away. After that spiritual friend’s last letter, the blessed verse “We shall make thee to recite, so thou shalt not forget” was heard from the Dawning-Place of the Cause and the Day-spring of Revelation. What was written was correct, but the honored Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, sent your letters, and likewise the funds you dispatched and other items all arrived and were accepted. Should any act proceed from this servant wherein forgetfulness or oversight becomes apparent, pardon is hoped for. God is witness and testimony that night and day I am immersed in the sea of occupation - writings before the presence of the Intended One, as well as replies to letters and engagement with prison matters which each day appear in a different form and are marked by new events. It is therefore clear and evident to that spiritual friend what matters cause delay and postponement. God is witness and the All-Knowing that that honored friend hath ever been and continues to be mentioned before the countenance of the Intended One of all worlds. Your expressions in proving God’s Cause are in truth a treasure hidden with God, and there is and hath been no harm in attributing them to you or to Mir Samiy, upon him be the Glory of God, who stands in service. In one station He hath said “We make no distinction between any of them.” I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to aid you to exalt the Word and manifest the Cause as He hath ordained. At this moment this exalted Word hath appeared from the Kingdom of utterance of the Lord of all beings. His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O Husayn! With the key of the Most Great Name, open the gates of men’s hearts, and with the wings of detachment soar in this spiritual atmosphere, that those who tarry may follow and learn. We have ordained for thee that which causeth bodies to take flight, how much more the spirits.”</p>
<p>Praised be God, that beloved of the heart hath attained unto the supreme bounty, and there hath been revealed that which, should all on earth discover its sweetness, they would turn wholly sanctified unto God. You have been and continue to be confirmed, and with the sword of life you have broken the backs of the idolaters - a breaking that will not mend, which skilled physicians and accomplished healers are powerless to repair. Exalted be our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven and the Master of the hereafter and this world.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote concerning forgiveness, it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and these sublime words descended from the Kingdom of utterance of the Intended One of all worlds. His word, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>“O thou who hearkenest to thy Lord’s utterance! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and enabled thee and taught thee and caused thee to know Him and made thee speak His mention and praise amongst His servants. He hath aided thee as a bounty from Him and enabled thee as a gift from His presence and forgiven thee as a mercy from His side. By My life! Through My remembrance the ocean of forgiveness hath surged and the breezes of thy Lord’s tender mercy, the Forgiving, the Bountiful, have wafted. We beseech God to assist thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance that thou mayest assist Him amongst His servants. Verily He is the Hearing, the Answering.”</p>
<p>I convey that in these days all must gaze toward a single horizon and hold fast to service to the Cause. Praise be to God, in most lands the light of the Cause is manifest, yet some among the people of the Bayan remained veiled and concealed in times of hardship. Now that some measure of assurance has been attained and seekers are evident, they have emerged from behind the veil like flies and seek to organize a party like the previous party. Glory be to God! If this was the purpose, why did they initially separate from the first path? And some, despite claims of faith and certitude, have been and are thinking of the Calf, seeking through a hundred thousand lies and calumnies to guide helpless souls according to their own desires. In any case, such souls have been and are rejected before God. Beseech the Truth to protect His servants and not afflict them with the associating of the hopes of the ignorant. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. In all cases that spiritual friend must be vigilant and, to the extent possible, be occupied with protecting the servants. Verily He is the Helper, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about Muhammad-Hasan and Mulla Muhammad-Taqi, upon them be the Glory of God, who requested mention of them in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, after submission before the Presence these decisive verses descended from the Kingdom of the Will of Truth, exalted be His glory. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks:</p>
<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! Thou hast attained unto the traces of My Pen following thy turning to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou didst hear and respond on a day wherein the servants denied the appearance of God and His evidences, and the greatness of God and His sovereignty. Thus did their lying tongues describe for them what they followed of every remote ignorant one. We have mentioned the people of the village with a mention before which every wondrous mention bows down. We counsel thee and those who have believed to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. The Dispensations have ended with this Most Great Dispensation and this Mighty Announcement. Whosoever claims a matter is verily a lying impostor. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this, even as it bore witness before in a Book named the Most Holy before God, the Mighty, the Praised. Remember My loved ones there and give them glad tidings of My attention and My turning toward them and My mention and My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the Ancient Commander. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of utterance and aided me to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance and to acknowledge that which the tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken. Verily Thou art He Whom the conditions of Thy creation withhold not, nor the turning away of Thy servants. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Muhammad-Hasan:</p>
<p>He is the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hasan! The Wronged One desireth to make mention of thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of Lords. Hearken unto the Call from this Most Great Quarter, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of Necks. Verily He hath appeared and made manifest His Most Great Cause. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every doubting denier. Take the Book with strength from Us and rely in all matters upon God, the Revealer of verses. Let nothing among all things sadden thee, nor let the veils of those who have disbelieved in God in the return withhold thee. Take the cup of utterance in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, then drink therefrom despite every denier who hath turned away from God, the Possessor of creation. Say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me and made me aware. I beseech Thee by Thy signs and Thy manifestations to assist me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. Then ordain for me that which will protect me from the evil of Thine enemies. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that these two souls who were mentioned have attained unto bounty and have been nourished from the chalice of the utterance of the All-Merciful. Well is it with them, and again, well is it with them. This evanescent servant remembers the loved ones of that land with praise, glory, exaltation and greetings. God is my witness that the loved ones of that land have been and are ever present before my eyes. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make that land ready for the outpouring of the fire of love for the Desired One of all worlds, and I ask for each one that which hath had and hath no likeness or equal. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you, and upon all who are firm, steadfast, resolute and faithful. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be unto the one true God, Who hath adorned the world of being and the kingdom on high with the presence of the perfect man, Who hath commanded justice that the very root of the tree of oppression might be plucked from the earth and returned to that which is meet and destined for it. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! How great is His dominion, how mighty His utterance! His consummate wisdom is manifest and evident in all things, and the luminary of His Cause shineth resplendent and ready above all things. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, and blessed the helper who hath arisen to render Him victorious, and blessed the supporter who hath aided Him in the days of His imprisonment. And peace and blessings be upon the Hands of His Cause who have traversed the lands to exalt His Word, who have not violated His Covenant and Testament, and who have attained unto the choice wine of revelation in His days. These are among the most exalted of creatures in His Book. The angels and the Spirit pray for them by His leave. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them and assist them in a manner befitting their connection to His firm and mighty Cause. We are all, verily, among those who return unto Him.</p>
<p>May my spirit be offered up for your remembrance! Your esteemed letter from Baku and from other places hath shone forth like a brilliant light and hath been the cause and means of illumining this heart that was afflicted with the darkness of sorrows. The mention and remembrance of the Afnan is a true sustenance, for through it is strength imparted to one’s being. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His Afnan in a manner befitting His days. Verily, He is the Revealer of verses and the Fulfiller of needs. After reading it, we proceeded to the Most Exalted Station, and after attaining presence and receiving full permission, all of it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of the worlds and was honored to be heard. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of utterance - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Commanding, the All-Wise […]</p>
<p>O Afnan! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! In view of the world’s lack of capacity, countless calamities have encompassed the nations. This Wronged One hath informed all of that which would protect and elevate them. The outpourings of God’s Most Great Ocean have, in the days of His Manifestation, been lavished upon all creation. God, exalted be His glory, beareth witness that this Wronged One hath desired naught but the triumph of His Cause, the exaltation of His Word, and the guidance of all humanity. I speak the truth, and for the sake of God do I speak: Today the people of Baha must arise to aid the Cause, and with spirit and joy, with wisdom and utterance, must revive and refresh those who are withered and faded, turning them from that which they possess to that which God possesseth, and clinging to that which draweth souls near unto Him.</p>
<p>Your honor and all the Afnan know well what the deeds of this community were before and what they became thereafter. The polytheists and the deluded ones among the people of the Bayan have now, contrary to the past, outwardly clung to that which leadeth to attainment and meeting. Jinab-i-Haydar-’Ali hath written that Hadi of Dawlatabad hath arrived in the Land of ?a and on Fridays ascendeth the pulpit to commemorate the tribulations of the Prince of Martyrs. In ’Iraq, some have engaged, without divine permission, in revelry and merriment during the first of Mu?arram, conduct which is opposed to all the peoples of the world. Until now some of that land’s inhabitants have imagined that this community, God forbid, hath not and doth not love the Prince of Martyrs, peace be upon him; nay, that their hearts are aflame with the fire of hatred and animosity.</p>
<p>In truth this matter hath caused the stumbling of souls, for they know not the bounty and grace that were manifested on that Day. Moreover, these companions know with absolute certitude that His Holiness hath arisen from the grave by God’s leave; therefore the Concourse on High, the dwellers of the All-Highest Paradise and the Supreme Heaven are all engaged with Him in joy and gladness. In any case, while the veils of ignorance and unawareness persist, one must adhere to the customs of the people for the sake of drawing near and guiding souls. Most people are ignorant, and this ignorance hath resulted from lack of education. The turbaned ones in Iran, devoid of justice, have uttered that which was born of fancy and conjecture, and most are still unable to rend these veils asunder unless divine grace assist them and deliver these poor ones.</p>
<p>The people of the Bayan are observed to be even more veiled than those souls. They themselves acknowledge that after the Qa’im will come the Manifestation of Husayn, and all the Prophets will gather beneath His standard. Nevertheless they see yet deny, they witness yet recognize not. Indeed, the proofs of truth are beyond counting, but hearing ears are lacking. Those who were clinging to that which is rejected now make show of that which is accepted. Deception hath reached such a point that the pen is powerless to describe it.</p>
<p>This Wronged One hath, from the beginning until now, commanded all to perform such deeds as would guide souls and draw them near, and hath dedicated two days of Mu?arram to Husayn ibn ’Ali, peace be upon him - the first by virtue of the Primal Point’s deputyship, and the second in his own right. Blessed is the soul that hath done what was commanded in the Book. O people of God! Hold fast to goodly character and praiseworthy deeds, for these two […]</p>
<p>Secondly, by inherently blessed is the soul that acts according to what is commanded in the Book. O party of God! Hold fast to pure morals and praiseworthy deeds, for these two attract the hearts and minds of the world. God, exalted be His glory, has in this Revelation ordained these two as helpers and supporters. The people of Baha must with complete determination hold fast to these two and occupy themselves with the conquest of hearts and minds. We beseech God, the Most High, to aid them and assist them in that which will cause His Cause to be exalted amongst His servants. In truth, the companions of love, upon them be the glory of God, His mercy and His care, have attained to that which hath had and hath no likeness or equal. We hope that henceforth they will behave toward all people as would a kind and loving father and exert utmost effort in preserving a pure and goodly reputation.</p>
<p>O ’Ali, O Afnan! Make mention of all the friends on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of God’s bounty and mercy. We beseech God to manifest through you that which will cause the people of the world to become detached. From the Land of Ta numerous petitions have arrived, but he who stands in service hath shown submission and contentment. No complaint hath been manifested from him; rather, with complete determination he hath striven to prevent these reports from reaching the Most Holy Court. Blessed is he and happy is he. All the Afnan and friends must arise to reward this rare and meritorious deed. Verily, God is the Helper, the All-Wise, and He is the Enabler, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>God is witness and testifier that from the deeds of him who stands in service hath appeared that which causeth joy and happiness to those near and sincere. This evanescent servant saith: My God, my God! Take the hands of Thy Afnan and Thy loved ones and assist them in the service of Thy Cause. Thou seest them, O my God, holding fast unto Thee and unto Thy Strong Cord. Send down, then, upon them the rain of Thy mercy from the clouds of Thy grace, and open before their faces the doors of Thy bounty and generosity. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Commander, the Wise. In view of the deed manifested by him who stands in service, it is certain that divine reward shall reach this pure and holy deed, and in this world and the next shall clothe this deed with eternal honor and everlasting acceptance. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. In these days, mention of this praiseworthy deed hath repeatedly been heard from the tongue of grandeur. Inevitably grace shall encompass, mercy shall be bestowed, and the hand of power shall assist. Verily, He hath power over all things. He answereth him who calleth upon Him and giveth unto him who asketh of Him. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the friends in Badkubih, upon them be the glory of God, the Lord of Oneness, they are truly aflame and mention of them hath been and is repeatedly made in the Most Holy Court, especially the teachers who are the cause of the turning of the servants and their orientation toward the Source and Return. We ask and beseech God to increase their determination and steadfastness in such wise that they may become known and mentioned among the people of the world for their service to the Cause. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to exalt His loved ones there and make firm their feet upon the path. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower. Within His grasp are the reins of all affairs and in His right hand is the kingdom of the dominion of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the attention of Karbila’i Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God, after presenting it they said that in these days the cold weather and the turbulence of the sea do not allow for travel, but permission has been granted that whenever the severity of cold subsides, there would be no objection to his turning towards the prison. This is what the Wise Commander has ordained.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning the stay of the beloved of hearts, Jinab-i-Varqa, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, that he should stay for some time - truly today all must be engaged in service to the Cause, and service to the Cause is teaching. God willing, may all be assisted. They said: “O Varqa! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all beings. God willing, thou art holding fast to divine counsels and, detached from all else, art clinging to Him. This station is the most glorious of stations and the cause of the turning of hearts and faces. Praise be to God, thou hast repeatedly attained His presence, meeting, vision and hearing. He verily will assist thee and aid thee, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.” The sons are remembered before His face and are blessed with grace and mercy. We beseech God to assist them in His remembrance, His praise, and His service, the Mighty, the Exalted.</p>
<p>God willing, may that beloved of hearts make the servants aware of the divine verses and what hath appeared from His presence, and awaken them from the slumber of heedlessness. In these days the servants are seen to be better than before; most have intended to understand this Cause. Now that beloved one must, while in that land, engage in guiding people with the utmost joy and fragrance. They have repeatedly made teaching conditional upon wisdom, lest something occur that might cause the weak to waver. You have been present in the prison and have seen and witnessed the wisdom with which the chosen ones are commanded. It is hoped that all the chosen ones in that land will hold fast unto wisdom and act in ways that cause the nearness of the servants. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. Please gladden the eyes of Azizu’llah and Ruhu’llah, upon them be the Glory of God, who are truly remembered in heart and tongue and are visible before His face. We beseech God, our Lord, to ordain for them what beseemeth His greatness, His favors, His generosity and His gifts. He is verily the Hearer, the Answerer. God willing, these prayers will be answered. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the Afnan, Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, he has arrived and attained the honor of presence and meeting, and was honored at the feast the previous night. We beseech God to assist him and ordain for him glory and wealth. He is verily the Lord of all beings and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Concerning your request for permission to return and bring one or two souls with you, after presenting it in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, it was honored with acceptance - may my soul be a sacrifice for His favor. It is hoped that from your honor will appear that which is befitting, so that its fame may encompass the world and straighten the crookedness of this faithless world. This matter is most precious and desirable, and surely divine confirmations will assist and make it manifest. He is verily the Generous, the Possessor of Great Grace.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the land of the Holy Shrine, God willing, it will be arranged and accomplished. For nearly a month or more during these days, the heavens have both wept and lamented due to the heedlessness of the heedless ones and the oppression of the oppressors. Therefore, the paths were blocked and the ways forbidden. However, when divine grace provides assistance and the paths and ways become temperate through the spring breezes of the All-Merciful, your honor’s instructions will be carried out. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the Enabler, the Powerful, the Wise. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon those who love you and hear your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord, the Lord of the visible and invisible, the Lord of all worlds, and praise be to Him for He is the Master of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about sending trees and their saplings and the hidden fruits therein, which in truth are the very essence of mysteries - indeed these matters are worthy of eternal praise and remembrance, for the purpose is the presence of the delicate, blessed, gathered fruits before the face of the Intended One and His chosen ones, saints and servants. Therefore, every person of capability should consider this according to their ability, especially the Afnan of the Blessed Tree, upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God, who are themselves related. Surely they have not hesitated and will not hesitate in services that are in the name of the Truth, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to assist them, exalt them, strengthen them, and open before their faces the gates of grace, wealth and glory. Verily He is the Giver, the Forgiving, the Mighty, the Great. And we beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to enable its supporter, its receiver, its sender, and its bearer who takes and delivers to the place God has ordained for its planting. Then we beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for the sender what befits His generosity and bounty, and to make his remembrance as enduring as the endurance of the trees and their fruits in the earth. Verily He is the Protector of those who intend by their deeds and actions the benefit of the servants and the prosperity of lands. Verily He hears the voice of whoever calls upon Him and remembers whoever communes with Him, and He is the Fulfiller of needs from before and after. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Remembrance and the Utterance</p>
<p>This is a Book from the Wronged One to him who has turned and hastened unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Muhammad! We testify that thou hast soared on the wings of longing unto the Lord of the Day of the Covenant. Thou didst arrive and present thyself before the Gate, and didst hear the Call from the Dawning-Place of grandeur, and didst attain that which the near ones have attained. Render thanks unto God for this great bounty.</p>
<p>O Taqi! Hear My call once again. Counsel the people to fear God and to that whereby His wondrous Cause may be uplifted. Say: Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan withhold you from your Lord, the All-Merciful. Leave them behind you, turning unto the Tree of Revelation whereon the Interlocutor of the Mount doth speak: “Verily, there is no God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny. Be thou vocal in My remembrance, turn thy face unto My countenance, take hold of My Book with the strength bestowed by Me, arise to serve My Cause, and turn unto Mine all-glorious horizon, at whose appearance the horizons prostrated themselves and the lights bowed down in humility. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth, as a grace from Us upon thee, and I am the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Go forth with My Book unto My lands and remind My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy. Say: God is with you under all conditions. We hear and We see, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Fear God, O people, and follow not those who have exchanged the ocean for a drop and certitude for idle fancies. These are among the most lost, as recorded in a clear tablet.</p>
<p>We testify that thou wert present and didst mention the people of Qaf who fulfilled God’s Covenant and His Testament and were among the steadfast. And thou didst mention the people of Za who cast away vain imaginings, clinging to the cord of certitude. We testify that We heard from thee mention of the people of Ta who believed in the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, and the people of Qaf and Mim and Kaf. Rejoice thou at My testimony and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones in Sad and give them glad-tidings of the signs of God, the Lord of the worlds. O people of Sad! The Lord of creation hath turned toward you from the prison quarter and beareth witness to your acceptance, your devotion, your humility and your submissiveness to a Cause before which the necks of the idolaters have bowed. There hath befallen you in the path of God that which hath caused the Holy Spirit and them that circle round My mighty Throne to weep. Ye have been forced to leave your homes by reason of what hath befallen you. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, to this every discerning mystic doth testify. What aileth Me that I behold the wolf pursuing My sheep? Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. We counsel you to manifest the greatest steadfastness in this Cause whereby the faces of the idolaters have been darkened.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Abhar! The Wronged One hath turned toward you from the prison quarter and hath mentioned you in such wise as cannot be equaled by the wealth of the rich nor by all that the kings and rulers possess. He who was present before Us made mention of you; thus have We remembered you in this clear Tablet.</p>
<p>O Qamsar! The breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over thee and thou hast attained that which most cities of the world have not attained. Recognize thou this great bounty. We counsel thee to preserve what thou hast been given by God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The crier hath cried out, the raven hath croaked, and the Dove of the Throne hath spoken: “There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Beauteous.” We make mention of Our loved ones in thee and bid them to be steadfast in this momentous News. That which We foretold you hath come to pass, when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra and in the Land of Mystery and in this noble station.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones and friends in Mim and Alif, and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. O My companions there! We testify that ye have turned towards and believed in God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Blessed are your homes wherein hath been raised the remembrance of God and the remembrance of His loved ones, and ye have attained unto that which was written down in the tablets of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O My companions in Sin and Nun! The Wronged One remembereth you and commandeth you to that which beseemeth this Cause, from which every heedless doubter hath turned aside. Take ye hold of the Book of God with the strength bestowed by Us, and be ye among those who are firmly established. We counsel you to preserve that which ye have been given. Render thanks unto your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Ibn-i-Abhar hath appeared before the Most Great Scene and made mention of you. We have remembered you in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! Thou hast made mention of My male and female servants before the Countenance, and each servant and handmaiden hath attained unto that which was mentioned in the books of God and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in a Tablet which none save He hath comprehended. Thus hath the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End been raised up in this exalted station. Say: O concourse of creation! By My life, the All-Merciful! We have sent unto you the fragrance of My sweetest utterance. Do ye perceive it, or are ye of the heedless? The horizons have been filled with the breathings of revelation. Do ye sense them, or are ye of those who slumber? The fragrance of the All-Merciful’s robe hath been wafted throughout the world. Blessed is he who hath recognized it, found it, and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!” By God! The world hath been perfumed by the fragrances of the Pen, yet the peoples are in strange drunkenness. Say: O people of the Bayan! The All-Merciful hath come with the standards of divine knowledge, though it be against your wishes. He is the One before Whose name the Point of the Bayan and the Concourse on High and the angels brought nigh have prostrated themselves. Say: The Faithful Spirit circleth round the Throne, while the dwellers of Paradise abide beneath the shadow of this glorious and wondrous station. Whoso turneth away from this Name hath turned away from God in the past and in the future. To this testifieth He with Whom is a preserving Tablet. The mercy that hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning this mighty Cause, whereby the limbs of the idolaters who cast the Book of God behind their backs have quaked, turning instead to every heedless one who hath turned away from God, the True King, the Manifest.</p>

<p>The Most Exalted One, He is God, Exalted be His Glory in Wisdom and Utterance</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! Upon thee be My peace, My loving-kindness and My mercy. The letter thou didst send through Badi’u’llah attained the honor of being heard at His presence. Praise be to God, it was adorned with the mention of God, the All-Glorious, the Most High, and was illumined with the lights of divine love. We beseech God to confirm thee in service to His Cause. Should thou turn, with wisdom and utterance, toward the land of Za, it would be acceptable in the sight of God, and from there to other lands. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Likewise, the letter thou didst send in the name of Jud, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, was mentioned before His presence. These days are the days of God. Thou must engage in teaching the Cause for the sake of God, that perchance the turning away of the servants may be transformed into acceptance, their unbelief into faith, and their polytheism into unity. The grace of God hath been and ever will be infinite. How strange that some souls, for the sake of the fleeting colors of this world and a life of but two days, have remained deprived of God’s eternal bounties and everlasting life. Beseech God that through the finger of the Hands of His Cause–that is, souls who are firm, steadfast, assured and well-pleasing–He may rend asunder the veils, dispel the clouds of glory, and remove the intervening barrier. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Fakhru’d-Din, upon him be My glory. We make mention of him at this hour with the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds, and give him the glad-tidings of My grace and My mercy, for I am the Gracious Herald. O Fakhru’d-Din! He who loveth Me hath made mention of thee, and We make mention of thee in this perspicuous Book. Verily He loveth those who love Him and remembereth those who remember Him, as a mercy from His presence, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Cast aside what the people possess and take what thou hast been given from God, the Powerful, the Almighty. Beware lest what the servants possess should prevent thee from the Lord of creation, or the gloating of the transgressors sadden thee. Take hold of the Book with the strength from Us and the wisdom from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the Commanding, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to turn unto Thee and to face toward Thy horizon. I beseech Thee by the tabernacle of Thy glory and the pavilion of [Thy protection], and by Thy Cause through which Thou hast subdued Thy servants and Thy creation, to make me steadfast, firm and upright in Thy Cause. Then write down for me, O my God, by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me near unto Thee in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! At this moment We make mention of thy mother who turned unto God, heard and believed in God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. We have previously made mention of her in such wise that its fragrance will never cease to endure throughout the eternity of My Best Names, and I am the Faithful Witness Who speaketh. Blessed is she and joy be unto her for having fulfilled her covenant and not having broken her pledge. Blessed is she and those who love her for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Great. Convey My greetings unto her face and remind her of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty, and give her the glad-tidings of My mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>I give thee glad tidings of My grace and remembrance and mercy and bounty which have encompassed all existence both seen and unseen. Convey on behalf of this Wronged One greetings to the uncle and his namesake. Their mention hath been made in the presence of this Prisoner and each hath attained unto the verses and favors of God. We beseech God to assist them and enable them to celebrate His praise and glorification and to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and responded, and upon those women who have believed in God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the new believer. Make mention of her on behalf of this Wronged One and say: O My handmaiden! The world was created for the knowledge of God, glorified be His majesty. Yet when the Purpose was made manifest and the proof was perfected and the verses were revealed and the evidences were resplendent, all turned away and occupied themselves with denunciation and cursing. Praise be to God Who, through His grace, saved thee and guided thee. Thou hast attained unto that which hath no peer nor likeness. Give thou glad tidings unto My handmaidens of My grace and remembrance and mercy and bounty which have encompassed all existence both seen and unseen. Convey on behalf of this Wronged One greetings to the uncle and his namesake. Their mention hath been made in the presence of this Prisoner and each hath attained unto the verses and favors of God. We beseech God to assist them and enable them to celebrate His praise and glorification and to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and responded, and upon those women who have believed in God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>As to his honor Mir Muhammad Husayn Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God. Safar 1304.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>The Call hath ever been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, and the Summoner - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - is established upon the Throne of Utterance. Yet time and again hath this most exalted Word proceeded from the tongue of the Creator of Heaven, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>O thou who art present! These weak-natured ones of the world have never been and are not now capable of hearkening. Until now they have spoken of the idols of names while remaining heedless of and turning away from the Truth, exalted be His glory. By what proof and evidence do they believe in the Point of the Bayan, while by what evidence are they veiled and debarred from the Purpose of all worlds? That Station through whose blessed Word a hundred thousand letters have been and are being created - this they have abandoned, clinging instead to a mere name among names and taking pride therein, although they were and are in no wise aware of His Cause. Blind are their eyes and stopped are their ears. Verily God is the Powerful, the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>They who are in the Bayan are incapable of reckoning that which hath been revealed in this Most Great Revelation. Yet still they deny. The divine evidences are manifest and His signs encompassing and visible. The effects of the Most Exalted Word are dawning and shining forth from all directions. Every person of insight hath testified and every informed one hath borne and beareth witness. Glory be to God! Heedlessness hath reached such a point that they have denied what they have seen with their own eyes and turned away from what they have heard with their own ears. They have forgotten the counsels of the Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. How strange, utterly strange! They teach the people through the Book of Certitude while remaining unaware. The travelers to the Land of Sad mentioned this matter after their arrival, and subsequently his honor the Beloved of the Heart, Haydar-’Ali - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - wrote that the deniers are teaching people through the Book of Certitude. From the beginning of Adam until now, such heedlessness hath never appeared. Hadi Dawlat-Abadi in the Land of Sad, like those souls before him, is occupied with leading the poor people astray - even though all the people of the Bayan witnessed with their own eyes on the Day of Judgment the fruits of the Shi’ih’s deeds, how they cursed the Truth entirely and martyred Him. They do not reflect for a moment with insight on what were and what became the fruits of that party’s deeds. In any case, man is astonished, the world is astonished. For one thousand two hundred years and more they turned away from truth and clung to falsehood. If anyone spoke about the birth of the Manifestation, they would immediately deem it necessary to kill and dishonor him. How utterly strange that among all those divines, not one attained true knowledge or tasted a drop from the ocean of awareness. The later blind ones have followed those sightless ones, occupied with the same matters and speaking the same words. At one time this blessed Word proceeded from the tongue of the Dawning-Place of the light of Divine Unity, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>O thou who art present! I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the heaven of merciful grace that until now, due to the weakness of the servants, the true meaning of Divine Unity hath not been revealed as it should be from the Pen of Power.</p>
<p>By the life of our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven, what they have stated is truth, there is no doubt in it. All that has thus far been rent asunder of the thick veils and the concealing clouds, this heedless party has again afflicted the people with veils even thicker than before and continues to do so. Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who holdest the reins of utterance and Who art the Omnipotent over all possibility! I beseech Thee by Thy unity, which none besides Thee hath fathomed, and by the stations of the Kaaba of Thy knowledge and the effulgences of the Sun of Thy wisdom, to protect Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones from the cawing of the croakers, the doubts of the suspicious, the hints of the transgressors, and the onslaught of the oppressors. Then ordain for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw them nigh unto Thy court and grant them the bounty of meeting Thee. O Lord! Thou seest him who hath turned to Thee and whose mention and praise have been presented before Thy face, whom Thou didst name Hussein - Mir Muhammad Hussein Bey - in the Book of Names by Thy descriptive Pen. O Lord! Thou seest his turning to Thee and hearest his mention and praise and the yearning of his heart. The servant at this moment, when the hands of his hope have been raised toward the heaven of Thy grace, beseecheth Thee to write for him that which befitteth the ocean of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Bless, O my God, those who have arisen to aid Thy Cause and have spent their spirits in Thy path, and whom the attraction of Thy verses hath so seized that the onslaught of those who violated Thy covenant and Thy testament did not prevent them. Verily, Thou art He Whom neither the opposition of the world nor the whisperings of those who have denied Thy favor can hinder. There is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, we are Thine and unto Thee shall we return.</p>
<p>Thereafter, numerous letters, each a faithful herald and clear messenger, arrived from that Beloved One. Utterances were heard from him and words reached the ear of understanding. The first word was confirmation and testimony of what had proceeded from the Tongue of Grandeur before creation and after it. The second word was thanksgiving and praise for the true bounties and heavenly sustenance. The third word indicated and bespoke longing and yearning, and likewise burning from the fire of separation. The fourth word spoke of health and well-being. Praise be to God, in each word a volume was beheld, and after reflection, discernment, joy and delight, intention was made to approach the Speaker of the Mount. The letters were presented and each was honored with attention at its time, and on each occasion the Tongue of Grandeur uttered that which had no likeness or equal. After the presentation of another letter, these exalted words appeared from the Most Sublime Horizon, His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh from His most exalted horizon […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the horizon of the Cause! Rejoice in that He Who hath no peer in His utterance, no equal in His remembrance, and no likeness in His Cause, maketh mention of thee. He hath come from the heaven of utterance with the kingdom of proof, and hath stood before all faces and proclaimed in the most exalted call: “O concourse of earth and heaven!” Thereby were the veils rent asunder and the All-Giver came with a Cause before which all who are in the heavens and earth are powerless. The Kawthar of life hath flowed from His utterance throughout all possibility, and the ocean of knowledge hath surged before the faces of all religions. Blessed is he who hastened, and partook, and drank, detached from the world and all that is therein. Woe unto every heedless and remote one!</p>
<p>By God! My Most Exalted Pen speaketh unto the people of Baha, and they who have turned away have no portion of this Most Great Ocean, nor any path unto God, the Lord of all worlds. They have denied God’s proof and His evidence, clinging to what they possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings. They have cast the Mother Book behind their backs, following the daysprings of delusion who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment. They claim faith in the Bayan while they deny its Revealer. Thus doth the Wronged One recount unto thee from the precincts of the Prison, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, that which ye possess, and all that the world possesseth, shall profit you not this Day. God’s Book beareth witness to this, if ye be of them that hear. The veils of idle fancy have prevented you from gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and vain imaginings from hearkening unto the Word of God, Lord of the mighty Throne. Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the servants, and be not like those who cast truth behind their backs, clinging to what their desires have commanded them. These, verily, are among the liars in God’s Book, the King, the Truth, the Manifest.</p>
<p>We were seated upon the throne when the servant present entered with thy letter and read it after Our leave. We heard what thy heart’s tongue uttered and have answered thee with this Luminous Tablet which speaketh the truth and summoneth the world unto the straight path of God. Say: O people of the earth, be fair in God’s name! Can anyone stand before all faces and speak that which opposeth their desires? Fear God, then speak with pure truth, and be not among the abject. The world and all ye behold today shall perish, and there shall endure what hath been ordained for My loved ones by God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones there, and remind them of what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, and give them the glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Goal of all worlds. Say: This is the Day of Remembrance and Utterance, and this is the Day of the victory of thy Lord’s Cause, the Merciful, the Compassionate. God hath ordained victory and triumph through the hosts of wisdom and knowledge, a command from His presence - and He is the One, the Sole, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is the Day whereon the Dove of Paradise warbled upon the highest branches, and the Bird of Utterance spoke upon the branch of inner meanings: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>When thou hearest My verses and drinkest the choice wine of grace from the cup of My bounty, say […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me with verses from which the mystics find in every letter thereof volumes of Thy loving care and bounty, and books of Thy grace and mercy. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Great Signs from which hath streamed forth the Kawthar of eternity, and by the rain from the clouds of Thy mercy, and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty and power in Thy dominion, and by the Sea - whosoever attaineth unto a drop thereof findeth himself detached from all else save Thee and sanctified from whatsoever Thou hast forbidden in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets - to assist this servant of Thine to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy servants. I testify that Thy power hath prevailed, Thy tender mercies have encompassed all things, Thy grace hath preceded all, and Thy Book hath proclaimed that verily Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee. The veils of the transgressors cannot withhold Thee, nor the allusions of the infidels who have concealed Thy Manifestation, disbelieved in Thy signs, disputed Thy proof, and denied the evidences of Thy might and the revelations of Thy power. O Lord! Thou seest him who seeketh Thy Sacred House and Most Exalted Station, and desireth the wonders of Thy bounty and generosity and that which would assist him to promote Thy Cause amongst Thy creation. O Lord! Aid him through Thy bounty and enable him through Thy grace. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty over all who are in the heavens and the earth. Verily Thou art the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>The grace of the All-Bountiful hath encompassed all directions. His generosity hath never withheld from any seeker nor forbidden any aspirant. The river of mercy and loving-kindness hath ever flowed from right and left, and all things, both male and female among His servants, summon others saying “Come ye! Come ye!” But few are fair-minded and fewer still are the hearing ones, save whom God willeth - our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the loved ones of that land, each hath been blessed by God’s grace, exalted be His glory. Mention of them all hath issued from the blessed Tongue. This servant beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - to set ablaze the loved ones of that country with the fire of His love and illumine them with the light of His grace, that each may become a path leading to the Desired One and a guide pointing to Him Who is the Goal.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of the daughter of the sister of Bibi Sardar, upon them both be the Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and one blessed Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Desired One of the worlds and was sent, that she might drink from its words the choice wine of wisdom and utterance. The Command is in the hands of God, the Lord of all possibilities and the Educator of all beings. His word, blessed and exalted is He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Manifest, the Evident […]</p>
<p>O My handmaiden and My leaf! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily it draweth thee to the Kingdom of My loving-kindness and the Heaven of My mercy, and giveth thee to drink of the Kawthar of Mine utterance, and causeth thee to hear the warbling of the birds of My Throne, and showeth thee the lights of the horizon of My Revelation, and maketh thee speak forth My remembrance and praise, and guideth thee to the path of My favors, and directeth thee to My Great Announcement and My Cause, firm and impregnable. O leaf! Thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down for thee from the heaven of My Will. We beseech God that He may aid thee to drink from every letter of the divine Tablet a chalice - nay, rather, an ocean. Praise be to the Peerless Beloved Who hath aided thee to turn unto Him and hath caused thee to attain unto verses and words whose fragrance is diffused, whose light is resplendent, and which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. Blessed art thou and happy art thou, for thou hast attained unto that whereunto the people of the world, both men and women, rulers and divines, kings and sovereigns, remain heedless and veiled, save only a few.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Desire, and glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved! I beseech Thee by the Kawthar which floweth from Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the choice wine of Thy revelation whose seal Thou didst break with the finger of might, to make me in all conditions severed from aught else except Thee and holding fast unto Thee and unto that which hath appeared from Thee and been sent down from the heaven of Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou seest Thy handmaiden turning unto Thee and drawn to Thy verses. I beseech Thee by that which is hidden in Thy knowledge and treasured in the repositories of Thy wisdom, to make me speak forth Thy praise amongst Thy handmaidens. Then ordain for me that which shall be a companion unto me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Praised be God that the fragrances of the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, have encompassed that honored leaf. How lofty is the station of one who arises today to serve the Cause and partakes of the Salsabil of divine knowledge and offers it to others. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to manifest souls who are worthy and deserving of recognition of these days and what hath appeared therein. At one time this most exalted blessed word was revealed from the tongue of the Creator of heaven, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O servant present! These people were not and are not worthy of recognizing this Most Great Cause and this momentous Announcement. These worthless ones were not and will not be worthy of the most exalted Paradise. Throughout ages and centuries they have been worshippers of idle fancies and idols. How can such souls become worthy of approaching the ultimate goal and most exalted summit?” Indeed, most of the peoples of the world cling to vain imaginings. Observe the Babi community - although they witnessed the vain imaginings of the previous community, namely the Shi’ites, and beheld the fruits of their deeds on the Day of Reckoning, they have again held fast to the same means as before. They cling to names while remaining heedless and veiled from their Creator, Manifestor and Originator. In any case, these immature ones were not and are not worthy of mention. Glory be to Him Who hath spoken with sure truth and manifest pure sincerity. He hath said, and His sweetest utterance is: “A one-year old child of the Day of His Manifestation is mightier than all who are in the Bayan. Verily our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Speaker, the Compassionate, the Manifest, the Generous.”</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the two souls who ascended to the Supreme Companion, this matter was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed for them from the Kingdom of utterance of our Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>He is the Forgiving, the Merciful</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of a servant among My servants who was named Jamal and who ascended to the station ordained for him by God, the Lord of all worlds. We testify that he heard the Call and believed in God, the Creator of heaven, and rent asunder the veils through the name of his Lord, the Master of the beginning and the end. Verily He forgave him after purifying him of his transgressions, as a grace from His presence, for He is the Forgiver, the Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Generous. We testify that he was adorned with the ornament of faith and knowledge, and We have sent down for him at this time a blessing from Our presence and a heavenly feast from Our midst, and We have made him to consort with God’s chosen ones and His loved ones in the highest Paradise, and I am verily the True, the Faithful Rememberer.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Husayn. By God! When I make mention of him, the ocean of forgiveness surgeth and the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Goal of all mystic knowers, is diffused. We testify that he was adorned with the ornament of his Lord’s loving-kindness, was speaking His praise, was standing in His service, and was holding fast to His firm cord. The Concourse on High found from him, at his ascension, the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Thus did the mercy of the Lord precede and His grace encompass all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Unto Him be praise and glory, and unto Him be grandeur and bounty! Each of those who have turned to the remembrance of the Desired One have attained and been adorned with the testimony of God. For the world and whatsoever is therein, change and transformation and extinction are evident, but for the blessed Word which shineth forth from the Dayspring of the Will of God, glorified be His majesty, change and transformation and extinction have no access nor effect. Unto Him be praise and thanksgiving in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>The other letter from that loved one, dated the fifteenth of Dhi’l-Qa’dih al-Haram, arrived and passed like a breeze from which the fragrance of love could be inhaled. It brought joy and increased mindfulness and remembrance, for it spoke in praise of the Desired One and bore witness to the acceptance, steadfastness and love of that beloved one. After its reading and perusal, it was taken to the Most Exalted Horizon and presented before the presence of the Creator of Names and the Lord of all things, attaining the honor of His hearing. Likewise, mention of the names of the friends that were in the letter was presented, and from the Kingdom of the Will of the Sovereign of Oneness there shone forth for each one that which illumined the world of inner meanings and utterance. Exalted be His favor and magnificent His grace!</p>
<p>His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Speaker, the Answerer!</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Once again the servant in attendance appeared with thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One. We have mentioned thee time and again that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Merciful. We have sent down for thee that which perisheth not, as beareth witness the Lord of the Kingdom of Names in the prison of Akka. Verily thy Lord is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Word.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Tahir in Sarayan! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. We make mention of thee through My grace, remind thee of My verses, give thee glad tidings of My mercy, give thee to drink of the Kawthar of life from the hands of My bounty, and draw thee nigh through My loving-kindness which hath encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven. We mentioned thee before and at this time that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Lord of existence. Be thou fluent in My praise, steadfast in the service of My Cause, turning with thy heart to My horizon, and holding fast to My extended cord. Say: O peoples of the earth! Follow the Lord of Heaven. He hath appeared in truth and all things bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you or the doubts of those who have denied God, the Lord of might, prevent you. Thus hath the squeaking of My Pen been raised in My prison. Blessed are the people who hear, and woe unto every heedless one who hath turned away from the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Ibrahim of Bujistan! He Who is the Desired One hath appeared and revealed what He willeth. The divines who were wont to lament His separation and await His days have turned away from Him. They are, in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds, accounted among the abject. The world is set ablaze by the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree, yet the people remain in manifest doubt. Hearken unto the call from the Divine Lote-Tree through this Wronged One, Who hath stood before all faces and proclaimed: “O concourse of kings! This is the Promised One Who hath come from the heaven of the Cause with a Command that nothing on earth can equal.” To this testifieth every informed sage. The people have denied God’s grace and mercy and what hath been sent down from the heaven of His wondrous utterance. They have cast behind them what they were bidden to observe and have taken up that which they were forbidden by the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ancient of Days. Beware lest anything prevent thee from remembering this Remembrance at Whose appearance the limbs of the heedless have quaked.</p>
<p>O Baqir of Faran! Where is thy fervor? Hast thou not heard My call? Nay, thou didst hear and remained silent. This beseemeth not one who hath attained to My days, heard My call, gained the victory of My traces, and witnessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath witnessed in this exalted station. Take My Book with the power bestowed by Me and say: “O concourse of the heedless! Judge fairly concerning that which hath appeared in truth from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The verses have been sent down in such wise as to fill the horizons. Fear God and be not among the deniers.” Say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink the choice wine of Thy presence, for having made known to me Thy path, and for having guided me to Thy Great Announcement. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that are nigh and the Beloved of the hearts of them that know, by the dawning-places of Thy signs, the Hands of Thy Cause, the Manifestations of Thy Self, and the Repositories of Thy knowledge, to aid me to remain steadfast in Thy love. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Hashim (the chief of the post office in Faran) that he may rejoice in My remembrance and be of them that are thankful. O Hashim! Be thou the breaker of the might of the aggressors through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Thus do We command thee as a token of Our grace. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great. Thy name was presented before the Wronged One, Who hath mentioned thee with verses that have attracted the hearts of the sincere ones. When the rapture of My utterance seizeth thee and draweth thee nigh unto the kingdom of My knowledge, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Strengthen my heart to safeguard Thy trust, my hand to take hold of Thy Book, and my feet to stand firm in Thy service. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, hoping for what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones who were not hindered by anything from turning to Thy most exalted horizon. They heard Thy call and hastened with their hearts to the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Source of Thy wisdom. O Lord! Thou seest the seeker making for the Ultimate Goal and the Supreme Height. I beseech Thee by Thy bounty not to disappoint him. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent, the Powerful, and worthy to answer.”</p>
<p>O Karbila’i Hasan of Faran! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee and counseleth thee with that which beseemeth thee in this wondrous Day. This is a Day the like of which the days have never witnessed, and before whose manifestation ages and centuries have bowed down. In every verse We make mention of those servants whom the affairs of creation have not withheld from the Truth. They heard, turned towards it, and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that know!” We beseech God to quicken thee through these verses with a new life, that thou mayest render thanks unto thy Lord, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! Blessed art thou for having raised My remembrance from thy station. We were present and heard what was mentioned therein. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have remembered those who gathered there as a token of Our grace. Verily nothing whatsoever escapes thy Lord’s knowledge. He witnesses and beholds all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We made mention of thee before, and at this time, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Guardian over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>We convey Our greetings to the loved ones of that land and counsel them with exalted words. Today the people of Baha are souls who have succeeded in shattering the idols of names and idle fancies, and find themselves detached and free from all else save God, to such extent that all that the various parties possess cannot withhold them from the Lord of the Day of Return, much less their words, intimations and doubts. By God’s life! The most lost of all parties were they who appeared on the Day of Reckoning, and more lost and heedless than these were the deniers of the Bayan, who have regarded tyranny as justice and oppression as equity. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they neither understand nor perceive.</p>
<p>If they make no claim to faith, it matters not, for this Wronged One’s purpose transcends such matters, and His decree surpasses all decrees. Our gaze has been and remains fixed upon the Greater Bounty, that all on earth might be set ablaze with the fire of love, an enkindling that leads to unity. Blessed are they who attain! The people of the Bayan have clung to mere fancy and held fast to names, remaining deprived and veiled from that station through a single letter of whose Most Exalted Word the Kingdom of Names was created. Beseech ye God to transform weakness of vision into strength and grant a fresh light, that they might see and find. The Command is in His grasp, and He is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Perfect bounty and heavenly sustenance have been sent down from the heaven of mercy. The rain of divine favors has refreshed the world and given it life, save for barren lands which remain deprived of this great mercy. In any case, one remains bewildered as to what they have turned to and what they have turned away from. What is their proof and what is their evidence? They have turned away from Him whom the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - called the first among worshippers, busying themselves instead with their own desires. I beseech God - exalted be His glory - to open a door that all might turn from tyranny to justice, from oppression to equity, and come to their senses. Verily our Lord hears and answers, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of the divine friends in the blessed cities and villages of Faran, Jadba, B-Sh, Qaryih, Gunabad, Khayrabad, Furugh, Turbat, Mihnih and other places, praise be to God that that spiritual friend became the cause of abundant good, for each one attained special favors and all were mentioned in the Most Holy Court. They have attained unto the choice wine of His utterance, the Kawthar of His remembrance, and the Salsabil of His all-encompassing grace. This servant conveys greetings and salutations to all, and begs for each one the good of this world and the next. Verily He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the two Abnin, upon them be the Glory of God and His loving kindness, it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. He says, blessed and exalted be He: Praise be to God, the hands of grace saved them and guided them from the wilderness of vain imaginings to the Dayspring of certitude. Through the grace of the True One, exalted be His glory, they have rent asunder the veils and barriers of conjecture and idle fancy, and have attained the effulgences of the light of the Luminary of certitude. We beseech the True One to assist them to aid His Cause through wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the One Who has power over what He wishes, and He is the Mighty, the Helper. This servant also beseeches from the heaven of grace and loving-kindness of the Goal of the world’s peoples that He may assist them in that which befits His Day. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Likewise, specifically for Muhammad-Sadiq Khan and Muhammad-Taqi Khan, upon them be the Glory of God, two Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the Divine Sacred Kingdom and were sent. I beseech the True One that they may drink from the hidden Kawthar within His words and verses. Whosoever drinks thereof shall find himself clinging unto Him and detached from all else.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the elevated and deceased Mulla Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, it was presented before the presence of the Countenance of thy Lord and achieved the honor of being heard, and these verses were revealed from the Dayspring of Divine inspiration. He says, exalted be His glory and all-pervading be His bounty:</p>
<p>He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Husayn! After Ghulam, the Mighty, the All-Knowing remembers thee, when He was wronged at the hands of the heedless. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him and believed when the people were in manifest rejection. Thou didst attain unto the traces of My Pen before thy ascension and after it through this luminous Tablet. The Light that shines from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of earth and heaven, be upon thee, O thou servant who art assured in God. I testify that thou didst attain unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. The doubts of the divines did not prevent thee from turning to the Most Exalted Horizon, nor did the authority of the aggressors veil thee. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who remember thee through what hath been revealed in this exalted station.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, he attained unto the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful, through one drop of which the people of the graves arose. The servant beseeches his Lord to send down upon him at all times a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His own Self. Verily our Lord, the Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of the deceased and forgiven Mirza Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy. After being presented before the Most Pure, Most Luminous and Most Great Presence, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the bounty of the True One, exalted be His glory. He says, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The first wave appeared and rose from the ocean of God’s mercy, the Lord of earth and heaven and the Ruler of the last and first, and the first light shone forth from the Day Star of grace and bounty upon thee, O thou who hast ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion. My Pen beareth witness that thou didst attain unto My days and didst drink the choice wine of utterance from the cups of My knowledge, and didst respond when My call was raised, and didst turn when thou didst attain that which was sent down from the kingdom of My wondrous remembrance. Upon thee be My glory and the glory of the Concourse on high and of the most sublime Paradise and the glory of them who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. Blessed art thou in that the Pen of the Most Glorious God moved to make mention of thee and testified to that which the treasures of the world cannot equal. He Who speaketh in every state beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>He hath indeed attained unto forgiveness and unto a testimony that nothing in the kingdom can equal. It behooveth every soul to sacrifice his spirit for this bounty that hath appeared and appeareth without regard to the worthiness of His servants. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid us in praising and thanking Him. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Another missive from that Beloved One hath bestowed fresh joy upon the heart. In truth, the traces of the chosen ones and the expressions of their praise and glorification make the soul fresh, for every letter thereof is adorned and perfumed with the fragrance of divine love, giving strength to the soul and steadfastness to the limbs. After reading and learning of it, we proceeded to the station of the Lord of earth and heaven, and after attaining His presence and presenting these verses, these words were revealed from the Kingdom of attributes. Thus speaketh the Lord, blessed and sanctified be He:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Witness</p>
<p>We have heard thy call once again and have answered thee with other verses. These shall draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt behold naught save the lights of the Day Star of thy Lord’s loving kindness, the All-Informed. Blessed art thou, and blessed are thy pen, thy heart, thy hearing and thy sight. Thou hast attained unto the hearing of My call and the witnessing of My signs, and hast been honored with My love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, through which the hearts of the mystics were attracted and the spirits of them who are nigh took flight. We beseech God to aid thee and make thee successful and to assist thee with the hosts of utterance for the propagation of thy Lord’s Cause, Who is manifest and seated upon His mighty throne. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving kindness be upon thee and upon them that are with thee among those whom God hath adorned through their connection with thee, and upon those whom nothing hath prevented from turning to their Lord - they who have turned and believed in God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Aqa Siyyid Ali Qadi, after it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, He said: “Wherever the aforementioned Siyyid may be, We shall send a tablet from the Kingdom of utterance. If he accepteth, he shall attain unto that which is the goal; and if he turneth away, verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.”</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for him from the Kingdom of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His station, His grandeur and His power.</p>
<p>O Ali! Hearken to the Call that hath been raised from the direction of Akka by Him Whose tongue, both outwardly and inwardly, and Whose limbs and very hairs testify to the unity of God and His singleness, and that He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Behold and then remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, appeared, the people denied Him, and there befell Him in the path of God that which caused His chosen ones and loved ones to weep. And before Him, when the Spirit appeared with God’s proof and His testimony, all on earth denied Him save whom thy Lord willed. And before Him, when Moses came with clear signs, Pharaoh and his chiefs turned away from Him and committed that which caused the people of the cities of justice and fairness to cry out. Thus did it befall the Prophets of God, His Messengers and His chosen ones throughout the ages and centuries.</p>
<p>O Ali! We have turned from the most eloquent tongue to the language of light that perchance thou mayest attain unto the living waters of utterance and quicken the souls thereby. They who are today deprived of the knowledge of God, glorified be His majesty, are accounted as dead in the sight of God. Today, life is not manifested through movement, nor sight through observation, nor hearing through listening. Ponder the Furqan, which distinguisheth between truth and falsehood. They who are bereft of the ornament of faith are not reckoned among those endowed with sight and hearing, nay rather, they are not accounted among the living before God.</p>
<p>Hath it ever been heard that when a soul arose with the divine Cause, and God, glorified be His majesty, adorned him with the ornament of Prophethood and Messengership for the guidance of creation and humanity, the people of that age accepted his words and hearkened to his utterance? Nay, by God! Such a thing hath never been heard from the beginning of the world until now. Whenever a light shone forth from the heaven of God’s will, glorified be His majesty, all arose to extinguish it and stood with utmost determination to deny it, turn away from it, and harm it.</p>
<p>Assuredly thou hast observed in the Books that this servant speaketh and hath spoken for the sake of God, and hath not emerged from the house of learning. I was sleeping when the breezes of my Lord’s grace awakened me and commanded me to raise my voice between earth and heaven. This was not from me but from God, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>From the earliest days until now, We have summoned all princes, divines, philosophers and religious doctors to the most exalted horizon without veil or concealment. If thou wouldst ponder on that which hath appeared and that which hath been revealed from the Kingdom of utterance, thou wouldst attain to that from which thou art now veiled. So momentous is this Cause that it hath been said: “The divines of that age shall be the most wicked divines beneath the shadow of heaven,” unto the end of the tradition. Examine thou the Book of Certitude which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance, that perchance thou mayest attain unto the living waters concealed within its words and be illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation. Say:[…]</p>
<p>My God, my God! I testify that Thou didst remember me when I was heedless of the wonders of Thy grace, and Thou didst speak to me when I was veiled by the veils of men. Alas, alas, for my heedlessness and Thy care, my remoteness from the precincts of Thy nearness, and my neglect of the ocean of Thy knowledge at the appearance of the pearls of Thy wisdom. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the world and Educator of the nations, by Thy Command whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts of Thy servants and the souls of Thy bondsmen, to aid me in rending asunder the veils that have hindered me from turning toward Thy most exalted horizon and the effulgences of the lights of Thy supreme attributes. I know not, O my God, my Lord and my Goal, whether Thou hast ordained for me to turn unto Thee and to attain unto the gate of Thy grandeur, or whether Thy decree and destiny have prevented me. O Lord! Disappoint not the seeker of what he desireth from the heaven of Thy grace, and withhold him not from what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning unto Thee and from clinging to the cord of Thy grace. Thou art indeed the Almighty before Whose power the power of the world hath bowed down. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Omnipotent, the Strong, the Most Exalted, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Were they to read what hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen and ponder upon what hath been mentioned, they would assuredly cross over the bridge and make for the Most Great Ocean of God. The stories of the ancients have withheld the servants from the heavenly feast; they cling to names while remaining heedless and turning away from their Creator and Originator. Day and night they occupy themselves with the mention of the Truth, yet not a single letter thereof hath been or ever will be accepted. Whenever divine tests appear, all are observed to stray from the straight path and turn away from the Dayspring of Revelation and the Source of inspiration. Would that they had been content with mere denial! Rather, they have perpetrated that which hath caused all things to lament and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and the most lofty chambers to return to the nethermost earth. Such is the state of the heedless and ignorant servants. I beseech God for assistance and seek divine confirmation for all, that perchance these limited and numbered colors may not prevent them from the depths of the ocean of oneness nor deprive them thereof. He is indeed the All-Merciful and the All-Forgiving. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Concealer.</p>
<p>If that beloved one deemeth it advisable, he may deliver his tablet; otherwise, let it be.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of Mulla Sultan. After this was presented, this most exalted word was sent down from the heaven of mercy. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Sultan! The heaven of knowledge is adorned with the stars of utterance. This is a mighty day; know thou its station. Ask God to aid thee to turn unto that for which existence itself came into being. Today the ocean of knowledge is surging and the Sun of Truth is shining. Forsake all else but God; perchance thou mayest attain unto His knowledge and find that which hath ever been the purpose of all worlds. The conditions and colors of this world were not and are not worthy. Rend asunder the veils; perchance thou mayest drink of the choice sealed wine and attain unto His presence. Thus hath the scratching of the Supreme Pen been raised up, and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Blessed are they that attain.</p>
<p>As bidden, these passages may also be conveyed or imparted if wisdom permits; otherwise silence is preferable. O beloved one, this servant has never liked nor does he like servitude. His purpose is that whatever flows from the Supreme Pen and the right hand of grace, all may drink it through God’s help. For it is observed that the people of the world were not and are not worthy of what has appeared, save a few. The bat does not seek the station of the sun, and the beetle has ever fled and continues to flee from the city of flowers and blossoms. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist His loved ones to drink the choice wine at all times and to ordain for them what befits His generosity and sovereignty. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>As to the renewed mention made of his honor Ibn, upon him be the glory and bounty of God, and the expression of his love for that beloved one - this was presented before His presence. The ocean of bounty is so surging that this servant is incapable and powerless to describe it. His honor Ibn and those related to him - that is, those souls who have drunk of the sealed wine and are gazing toward the supreme horizon - all are mentioned by the tongue of grandeur and the rains of mercy are pouring down. This is the greatest glad-tidings. Happy are they and blessed are they. Again and again their mention has been made. Verily bounty is in His hand and within His mighty grasp. He assists whom He wishes and ordains what He desires. He is the All-Choosing in the beginning and in the end.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart, they have repeatedly made mention of the exalted lady, the Most Sublime Leaf of Paradise, upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Some time ago, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed especially for her and was sent. Whatever rights reach her are accepted in the presence of God. They have said: blessed are those souls who arise to serve her for the sake of God and attain His good-pleasure. Likewise, especially for the assured lady, the spiritual leaf, upon her be the eternal glory of God, a most wondrous and most exalted Tablet was revealed and sent a few days ago. Indeed they have drunk of the choice wine of utterance and are occupied with the mention and praise of the Goal of the worlds. Their reasoned exposition attained the Most Holy Court. After its presentation and hearing, the Tongue of the Lord of all being spoke that which pens are powerless to recount. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, spoke thus:</p>
<p>O thou who art present! O thou who art present! Praise be to God, the spiritual leaf was assisted by the victory of the King of the Kingdom of Names and the Creator of heaven. We testify that she has drunk the wine of certitude and has attained to hearing the warbling of My Most Exalted Pen. God has manifested through her that which guides the servants to the path of guidance. She has done in the path of God that which has been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Every letter of her book has testified to her mention, her exposition, and her station before God, the Protector[…]</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>O thou who standeth before the Gate and art steadfast in the Cause! Upon thee be the peace of God and His mercy. The Glory hath appeared before the Wronged One and read thy letter, which gained His attention and merited this response which, through the tongue of His mystery, declareth: Verily, the answer is yea, yea, yea! Praise be to God, before and after, thou art favored with His special grace. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee each day that which befitteth the heaven of His bounty and the ocean of His generosity. He, verily, is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst behold in thy dream, We beseech the Exalted One to make it a blessing unto thee and unto His friends and loved ones. That the person mentioned was in a carriage with royal majesty and passed before thee, and afterward thou didst meet him with different attire, namely with a turban - there is no doubt that while majesty and royal grandeur are now present and manifest, this change portendeth a transformation of circumstances and an alteration of glory and might. We decree at this time his descent from the first station, that thereby God’s servants and creatures might find rest. This is what can be understood from the dream, and hidden knowledge hath thus decreed. However, as this Wronged One hath ever sought and continueth to seek good for all, therefore He saith:</p>
<p>O God of Bounty and Educator of all existence! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the One Who dominateth both the unseen and the visible, to adorn him who was mentioned with the lights of the Day-Star of Thy justice. Moreover, protect him from the evil of those who secretly desire to seize his kingdom. O my Lord! Illumine his heart with the light of recognition and aid him to turn toward the horizon of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Manifestation of Thy Self. O Lord! Withhold him not from turning toward the direction of Thy gifts, and make him not deprived of the outpourings of Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, to Whose power all created things have testified. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>As for thy reaching a house that was larger and more magnificent than the palace, and each of its chambers appeared as grand as the palace - these details testify to the greatness of the Cause, the expansion of the Revelation, and the extensiveness of its holy hem. And that thou didst see the Book in the hand of Him in Whose grasp lieth the kingdom of all things - this too indicateth the greatness of the Revelation and the exaltation of the Most Great Word, which is none other than the Book of God. This is that Book, each word of which exerciseth influence, authority and dominion in the world. God will soon manifest what hath been sent down therein of the gems of His commandments and the pearls of His laws. The interpretation of the Book and its exposition are in truth beyond reckoning. Knowledge is with God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>And concerning thy mention that in the same passage thou wert again honored to be present in one of its chambers and the utterances thou didst hear - this indicateth and portendeth the removal of the house’s ornaments, meaning those things that serve to beautify and adorn its outward appearance. And this matter is even now outwardly evident. Praise be to God, the foundation of the house is firm and its furniture and principles are established. Assuredly, the means of outward ornament shall later appear through the divine will, for they are concealed in the world of God’s Will and recorded in the realm of the Tablet and the Pen. Their effects shall surely become manifest and deliver the world from this abasement and constraint. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>

<p>In the Name of the All-Glorious, the Most Holy!</p>
<p>Mention hath been made by Us of him who desireth to know the Purpose when He Who was hidden appeared with a sovereignty that conquered all possibility, that the fragrance of certitude might seize him in the days of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and draw him nigh unto the Dayspring of assurance. The signs have appeared, the Hour hath been troubled, and the verses have been sent down in such wise as to fill the horizons. The fingers of the All-Merciful have proffered the cup of life - whoso drinketh therefrom findeth the delights of the rivers flowing in Paradise. The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined in such wise that the earth and the heavens were lit thereby, while those nigh unto God circle round the Throne and the sincere soar in this atmosphere which God hath sanctified from vain imaginings. Hearts have been attracted and minds have taken flight from the breezes of the days of God; they that were debarred are in doubt and schism. The atoms have testified to the Revealer of verses, and knowledge hath been effaced when the Self-Subsisting appeared with power and sovereignty. The Preserved Tablet hath appeared through My Hidden Name, and every hidden secret hath been revealed through this Name whereby the standards have been raised.</p>
<p>Say: O people! How long will ye follow vain desires? Cast them behind you, turning unto guidance. Verily it hath shone forth like the sun from the horizon of bounty and grace. Say: This Day shall profit you not that which the learned possess, nor that which the wealthy own, but rather that which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of all men. Where are the palaces of the Caesars, where the pyramids of the Pharaohs, and where are they who barred the way and turned aside from the Guide, and where are they who warred against and disputed with God? They have been cursed for what they uttered. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Say: Turn ye, O people, to the Supreme Horizon, the station wherein the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing doth speak. Beware lest the world debar you from the Lord of Names. Hasten unto Him with radiant faces and illumined hearts - this is better for you, did ye but understand. Remember when the Messengers of God and His Emissaries came unto them, they denied and disbelieved in them and in what was revealed unto them of scriptures and tablets. When We found the fragrance of thy turning unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, We revealed unto thee this Tablet and sent it to thee, that thou mightest soar on the wings of utterance in the atmosphere of wisdom and mystical knowledge, and deliver unto the people the Cause of thy Lord, that they might perchance be awakened and turn unto God, the Lord of religions.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the call of this Prisoner - verily He mentioneth thee for the sake of God, that there might appear from thee that which shall perpetuate thy remembrance in the Book of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Act according to what thou hast been counselled in the Tablet, and take the cup of life in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then give to drink thereof unto those who wander in the wilderness of forgetfulness, that it may bring them nigh unto God, the Lord of all mankind. Thus have We illumined the horizon of mystical knowledge with the sun of remembrance and utterance. When thou hast attained unto it, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things and in Whose grasp is the dominion of the earth and the heavens.</p>

<p>O Shaykh bearing the name of the Lord of all desire! Upon thee be the glory of God and His mercy. He is the All-Loving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Shaykh! Upon thee be the glory and bounty of God. In the visible world, there hath appeared that which hath bewildered the possessors of wisdom, knowledge, proof and testimony. For twelve hundred years the divines, mystics and worshippers of Iran clung to matters that were not remembered in the sight of God. Glory be to God! Throughout the nights and days, all beseeched and supplicated for the days of His manifestation, yet when the Most Great Luminary shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of eternity, all turned away and denied, save whom God willed.</p>
<p>How strange, utterly strange, that throughout the ages not one among the divines of that land was aware of the nature of His manifestation. They clung to unseemly tales and held fast to false stories. Throughout the nights and days, they were all worshippers of self and passion, devoted to mere names, holding fast to the cord of names while remaining heedless and veiled from their Creator, Provider, and the Source of their being.</p>
<p>By the life of God! Such was the wrong inflicted by that group upon the Seal of the Prophets that tablet, pen, banner and standard weep and lament. For those souls who were made manifest by His Word became occupied with these people and were barred from the true Sovereign. In the latter days, their rebellion reached such heights that mention of God’s truth, power and sovereignty was erased, leaving naught but the mention of letters. The station and rank of that party on the Day of Retribution is clear and evident to those possessed of insight.</p>
<p>The divines issued the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood, and the preachers opened their tongues in curse and execration. And now they speak from pulpits that which causeth the hearts of the sincere ones and those near to God to burn, and the tears of the monotheists to flow.</p>
<p>Strange it is that the people of the Bayan are still not awakened by what hath come to pass. They remain occupied anew with mention of Imam, successor, mirror and the like. The knowledge and mysticism of the past culminated in the Fourth Pillar. The purpose of this mention is clear and evident to them.</p>
<p>Say: Take heed, O ye whose darkness hath taken the place of light</p>
<p>Take heed, O ye whose whiteness hath spread across your face</p>
<p>In any case, the heedless party hath afflicted the servants with the delusions of the past. Seek assistance from God, that He might raise up souls who recognize the bounty and station of the Day of God, and who might protect the helpless people from the well of suspicion and fancy. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who pondereth what hath flowed from the tongue of Grandeur at this time, and blessed art thou, O Shaykh, for having shattered the idols in the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of all names, and rent asunder the veils through His binding and wise command.</p>
<p>The glory from Us be upon thee, upon those with thee, and upon all who are steadfast and upright. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Exalted be His Glory, His is the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>That which hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude hath been established through clear proof, namely that My praise and My mention cannot attain unto My purpose. The most exalted call from the highest realm befitteth Him not - how much less My mention and the mention of ones like Me, and My praise and the praise of ones like Me. Therefore We make mention, and We declare, and We say that mention and praise, from this day unto the day that hath no end, are reserved for the loved ones of God, glorified be His majesty - those souls who are seen to be evanescent and as nothing in the Will and Purpose of God, exalted be His glory, who stand with utmost steadfastness in the Cause of God, and who with spirit and joy speak forth His praise. These are the souls who are mentioned in the Books of old and of latter days, whom neither the doubts of the peoples, nor the signs of the world, nor the clamor of the polytheists, nor the commotion of the heedless have deterred. They have arisen and proclaimed with wisdom and utterance: “Verily our Lord is the All-Merciful, and He is the Help in Peril in all times.”</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of My heart! Thy letter arrived repeatedly, news arrived, and praise be to God, the morn of hope hath dawned, in that, praise be to God, the Sun of loving-kindness hath risen and permission hath been granted. O Ibn-i-Abhar! Advance with such acceptance as would cause all created things to advance toward the Qiblih of the horizons, and turn with such turning as would cause all beings to turn toward the Dawning-Place of the verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs. Verily the Wronged One hath heard thy call and hath answered thee time and again. We beseech God to make thy pilgrimage accepted, thy endeavor appreciated, and thy turning unto Him a treasure and honor and store with Him. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning his honor Haji, upon him be the peace of God - blessed is he! Faithfulness is greatly loved in the sight of God. How excellent is the state of those souls who have ever fixed and continue to fix their gaze upon Him. In brief, all are adorned with the ornament of permission, and this evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God, glorified be His majesty, to distinguish all with His special favors and to adorn them with the ornament of acceptance. Come ye, come ye, O people of fidelity! Come ye, come ye, O ye who have borne hardships in the path of God, the Lord of Names! Come ye, come ye, O ye who have witnessed the waves and the blowing of tempestuous winds! Come ye, come ye, O loved ones of God! Ye are they who have traversed land and sea and have remained patient in hardship and tribulation. Come ye, come ye, O people of the Covenant! Come ye, come ye, O companions of divine love! He Who is not known by what the tongue uttereth or what floweth from the Pen of creation hath called you. All this is from the loving-kindness of our Lord, the All-Merciful. Therefore let all turn with spirit and joy. Well is it with you, and may it be pleasant unto you. Peace and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon God’s loved ones and His friends.</p>

<p>O thou who standeth at the Gate! The All-Bestowing hath come to convey to the peoples that which will draw them near to the Lord of all men. Thy letter was received and heard. We beseech God to assist thee in that which is befitting His days. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>That which thou didst mention evidenceth love, humility, submissiveness and steadfastness. The honored believer and the Leaf who attained His presence in the days when the Luminary of Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of Iraq - praise be to God - have attained unto that which was recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in God’s Book. Blessed be they both! Verily, the Leaf hath drunk from the hand of bounty the wine of immortality, and for the believer hath been written the reward of attainment from the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>The honored Amin, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, hath repeatedly mentioned them in presence and absence. In truth, the one mentioned hath ever been occupied with the remembrance of God’s friends. Blessed is he! Concerning the House, that which they mentioned diffuseth the fragrances of the love of God, and these fragrances have not ceased nor will they cease. However, in previous years another will took precedence over your will and attained this service. Your House too hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance through boundless grace and mercy.</p>
<p>The Exalted Herald - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - saith: All is that they might attain unto the word of contentment. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having adorned this deed of mine with the ornament of Thy acceptance and Thy good-pleasure. I beseech Thee to ordain for me and those with me that which will draw us near unto Thee in every world of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>As to the Messenger, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, in recent years he hath been engaged in service, ever holding fast to the transcription of verses and the teaching of the Cause. We beseech God to send down upon his burial place the rains of His mercy. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. Praise be to God, he attained Our presence and dwelt for a time beneath the canopies of grandeur. We beseech God that He may cause all those who arose for His sake to serve and arrange his affairs to attain unto His grace, bounty, glory and generosity.</p>
<p>As for what was mentioned concerning the estate of that departed and elevated one: if there be no heir, it should be given through consultation to the poor of this party. We convey Our greetings to all the friends of that land, both men and women, and We gladden and remind them through the effulgences of the lights of the Word, the Goal of all the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance! We have revealed the verses and manifested the clear tokens, and have summoned all to the supreme horizon - the station wherein the tongue of God, Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, doth speak: “Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” We created all things for this Most Great Day, yet when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, they denied God and His proof, rejected His signs, and rose up against Him with such tyranny as caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide to lament. The world is adorned with the lights of His manifestation, and He Who conversed on Sinai calleth aloud with the most exalted call, yet none are confirmed in the blessed word “yea” save whom God willeth. This is the Day whose mention hath been recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. Say: O people of the earth! By the pearls of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance, this Day hath no peer or likeness. Deprive not yourselves of the ocean of divine knowledge, nor forbid yourselves the splendors of the Sun of grace. Today hath the seal of the choice sealed wine been broken by the finger of the Self-Subsisting One. Strive ye that ye may drink thereof in the name of the One True Friend, and be occupied with His remembrance and praise in the world’s assemblies. That Word from which the nobles of the earth flee hath become manifest and evident, yet the divines and mystics all shun it and remain unaware, save for that divine who rent asunder the greatest veil and shattered the idols of vain imaginings and desire through the power of the Most Great Name. He is the true divine and the spiritual mystic, and is as a crown upon the head of the world. Say: O servants! These few days of mortal life and its ornaments shall soon end and pass away. Strive ye that ye may attain unto God’s enduring favors. Whosoever today attaineth unto the recognition of Truth and the service of His Cause - his mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of God and His realms, and shall be recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O King of Kings and the Merciful unto all who are possessed of kingship! I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst subdue the world and summon the nations, to confirm me in steadfastness in Thy Cause and in holding fast unto the cord of Thy love. I am that poor one who hath turned unto Thee, O my God. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the ocean of Thy riches, nor to withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones - they whom the hosts of the earth and their ranks could not frighten, and whom its ornaments and veils could not prevent from turning unto Thee and from setting their faces toward the horizon of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God besides Thee, the Strong, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>His honor Mirza Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance!</p>
<p>O Ibrahim, Friend of the All-Merciful! One sacrificial victim was brought to the altar, was offered up, and returned alive. But the Glorious One, through His Most Exalted Word, attracted the people of Baha and sent them to the altar of the Peerless Friend, whereupon all freely offered up the crown of life at the feet of the Beloved of all worlds. The Shi’ih faction has mentioned the sacrificial victim in numerous books with the utmost honor and glory, yet these sacrificial victims - some of whom offered themselves up by their own hands, while others attained the most great martyrdom at the hands of the oppressors - despite the appearance of these clear proofs and the manifestation of signs, this shameless faction paid no heed and committed that which caused all things to lament and the Supreme Pen to cry out. Such is the condition of the servants. Say: O worthless ones of the earth! The winds of passion have established you in hell, yet you perceive it not. They counted the martyrdom of Husayn ibn ’Ali as a mighty proof of the manifestation of the Seal of the Prophets, yet they remain heedless and veiled from that which has come to pass in these days. Say: This is Husayn Who hath appeared after the Qa’im. Ponder upon that which was mentioned aforetime, that perchance ye may find the fragrance of utterance and choose for yourselves a path unto the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>The matter of Return, which according to the words of Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa’i - upon him be the Glory of God - is established and proven, was the Return of Husayn. All the Messengers and the Qa’im stand and dwell beneath His blessed standard, yet eyes and ears are prevented from seeing and hearing, and hearts from contemplation and attention. We beseech God that He may aid thee in service, that is, in teaching the Cause, in such wise that thou mayest be as an enkindled fire, igniting others, and as a brilliant light, illuminating others.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends in that land, and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the lights of inner meanings that have shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen, that all may arise, detached from all else, occupied with His mention and praise, and may act in accordance with that which will exalt the Cause. The world and all that is therein shall soon perish, and that which shall endure is what hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of the will of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Glory be upon thee and upon them, and upon every steadfast one who hath arisen and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Object of worship of all in the heavens and the earth!”</p>

Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison, for verily it will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We testify that thou hast attained unto the presence of God and stood before His countenance and heard that which was uttered [by the Wronged One] concerning His Great Announcement. Praise be to God that thou didst turn toward the prison in days when the fire of rejection was ablaze in all directions, and thou didst partake of the choice sealed wine from the hand of the Self-Subsisting at a time when most of the men of earth were observed to be bewildered and perplexed in the wilderness of remoteness. Know thou the value of this most great favor. He confirmed thee and guided thee to the shore of the ocean of His bounty. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens in those regions. We beseech God to aid all to that which will guide the handmaidens of the earth, and give thou glad-tidings to each of them of God’s bounty and grace, exalted be His glory. All have been and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. How excellent is the state of those handmaidens whom the doubts and intimations of the barking ones and the transgressors, and the oppression of the tyrannical, did not withhold from the Manifest Truth.

How many are the claimants to knowledge, grace, mystical insight and certitude who today are not and were not mentioned before the Throne, and how many are the souls who had no access to any gathering, yet attained to the hearing of the call and became joined to the Truth. O my leaf, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the cup of Thy love and the Kawthar of meeting Thee, and for having honored me with attaining Thy presence and causing me to hear Thy call. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Book and Thy Most Ancient Light to ordain for each one of Thy handmaidens the reward of meeting Thee and standing before Thy face. O my Lord! Disappoint them not of the ocean of Thy bounty, nor of the Kawthar of reunion with Thee, nor of the fragrances of nearness in Thy days, nor of the sweet-scented breezes of utterance at the dawning of the lights of the sun of Thy countenance. Thou seest, O my God, Thy handmaidens and leaves turning toward the lights of Thy face, dawning from the horizon of the heaven of Thy love, holding fast to the cord of Thy favors and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. Ordain for them, O my God, through Thy generosity, that which will cause the fragrance of Thy sanctity and detachment to be diffused through them. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Supreme Ruler over all Names!</p>
<p>This is a mention from the Wronged One to him who hath turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon when the Lord of Names appeared with a sovereignty that conquered all who are in earth and heaven, that the rapture of the wine of remembrance may so grip him that he may voice the praise of God amongst His servants. The horizon of bounty hath been illumined and earth and heaven have been made to shine, and yet most of the people remain in doubt and dissension. They have clung to their own desires and have opposed Him through Whom all things have proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the One, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.” The intoxication of the dregs of heedlessness hath seized them in such wise as to debar them from the divine fragrances when they were wafted throughout creation. The Divine Lote-Tree calleth out at all times with the most exalted call, summoning all unto God, the Creator of heaven, yet the people have been prevented from hearkening by their following of idle fancies. We testify that they are among the dead. All things have been stirred by the fragrance of reunion save those who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the End. God shall soon destroy their souls and what they possess through His conquering might. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Did that which the Caesars possessed benefit them, or did that which the Pharaohs had amassed avail them? Leadership deluded them to such a degree that they occupied themselves with the world and its ornaments during their numbered days, and were heedless of that which was with their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Behold the people and their lack of awareness - they have chosen for themselves that which will soon perish and have cast behind their backs that which will endure as long as God, the Lord of all men, endureth. Thus have We sent down the verses from the heaven of grace and favor and dispatched them that thine eyes may be consoled thereby and that thou mayest thank thy Lord by night and by day.</p>
<p>Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and remind them of that which We have revealed in the Scriptures and Tablets. Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! My glance is directed towards you, My tongue maketh mention of you, and the hands of My loving-kindness give you to drink of the Kawthar of My favors at eventide and at dawn. We counsel you to show forth the utmost steadfastness in the Cause of your Lord, the Lord of Names, lest the allusions of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Religions, debar you. Then make mention on My behalf of thy children and those who are with thee, and give them the glad-tidings of this mercy which hath preceded all created things. Say: Hold fast unto the cord of remembrance and praise amidst the concourse of creation, that thereby may be attracted the hearts of those who have been heedless of God when He came with the Kingdom of verses. And upon thee be glory, and upon them, and upon those who have attained unto this Day which God hath made the Dayspring of all days.</p>

Blessed are they who have attained unto the cord of true oneness and held fast thereunto. These are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. We beseech God to aid all and grant them such confirmation that their names may not be withheld from their Creator, Lord and Quickener.</p>
<p>Some souls who imagined themselves seated upon the cushions of steadfastness were deprived of the Truth merely at the mention of a name from among names. Say: O people! All names have been and are created by a Word. What fruit did the adherence of the former people to names yield? Night and day they were occupied with the mention of names, heedless and debarred from the Truth. The consequence of those deeds was that on the Day of Resurrection they cursed the Lord of all beings and martyred Him. And now in mosques and from pulpits they utter that which causeth the eye of God to weep and the hearts of His trusted ones to burn.</p>

How can I describe to thee what hath come upon us in this most mighty calamity from the heaven of the decree of thy Most Glorious Lord? And with what tongue can I console thee and the loved ones of thy Lord, the Lord of all creation? By God! I see no tongue capable of mentioning this all-encompassing tribulation, nor any ear able to hearken unto the utterance of this momentous catastrophe. Were it not for the commands issued in His Most Holy, Most Exalted Book, and His decree of patience and contentment, the very existence of the lovers would have been obliterated by the manifestation of the decree of separation, and their spirits would have departed their bodies from the overwhelming force of longing. But He, exalted be He, through His consummate wisdom, sustained His yearning ones, and through His abundant favor strengthened His sincere ones, and cast upon them the spirit of patience and submission in this mighty tribulation. I beseech Him, exalted be He, not to cut us off from the breezes of His grace, nor withhold from the gardens of our hearts the rain of His mercy, and to aid us in His service and in exalting His mention among His creation. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Merciful. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon the steadfast loved ones of God.</p>

<p>Faran! O Mulla Ghulam-Rida, upon him be the glory of God!</p>
<p>In My Name which is sanctified above mention of all names</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One from the heaven of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, that He might give glad tidings unto all peoples of this Day wherein the atoms have cried out: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Revealer of verses!” Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him Who hath come unto you with a sovereignty before which all names have bowed down, and with a Cause against which no parties can prevail. Aid ye your Lord, the All-Merciful. Soon shall all that ye possess perish; then shall ye find yourselves in abasement and loss. The gate of heaven hath been opened and He Who was promised by the tongue of the Prophets hath descended, He Who was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. We verily informed all when the croaking was raised in the land of Kaf and Ra. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. He hath appeared and hath spoken that whereat the denizens of the most exalted Paradise and the dwellers of the highest Heaven have lamented. And he who was named Abbas-’Ali hath joined with the people of hypocrisy. He is indeed among those who follow the people of error. Ask thou God to aid him to return. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the dominion of the beginning and the return.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! A group of polytheists have gathered and are striving mightily to lead the servants astray. Strange it is that souls who claimed to love God and counted themselves among the steadfast have turned away from truth at a mere croaking. Such is the condition of the servants. Convey to the friends of God the greetings of the Wronged One and remind them of what hath been revealed in the Book. The people of the Crimson Ark are souls whom all on earth cannot prevent from the divine path, much less can such heedless, wrongdoing persons. Though having no knowledge of the beginning of the Cause and its foundation, they have denied the Sun and followed the bat. They are indeed in manifest loss. Those souls who are with thee are each remembered in the Most Holy Court and have attained His grace. We beseech God to aid them all and keep them steadfast. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon all who are steadfast and firm.</p>

<p>O thou who hast turned unto My horizon and who hast held fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness! We beseech God to assist all His loved ones in that which hath dawned forth and shone resplendent from the horizons of the heavens of divine Tablets regarding the conditions of teachers. Praise be to God that in these days two deeds have become manifest from the loved ones of the lands of ’Ayn and Shin, and both have been crowned with acceptance and illumined with the light of His good-pleasure. The first was the manifestation of supreme oppression in such wise that […] and they did not protest. Whatsoever they witnessed and heard they left to God, clinging in all conditions to gracious patience and sublime tranquillity. The second was their intercession on behalf of enemies before the princes. In truth, that which was manifested is accounted before God as the most excellent of deeds.</p>
<p>Now beseech ye God and supplicate Him that He may illumine them with the light of unity and concord, lest there appear from them that which would grieve the hearts of them that aid the Cause.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! This Wronged One beseecheth God to adorn the sovereign of Iran with the light of justice and fairness. In recent years his majesty’s heart hath turned toward the oppressed ones. It is hoped that gradually the fruits thereof may emerge from the unseen into the visible realm, and from concealment into the arena of manifestation, inasmuch as this Wronged One hath loved and still loveth faithfulness, and hath desired to behold the realm of Iran as it behooveth. We beseech God to assist his majesty in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the laws, God willing, they shall be sent hereafter. And concerning Ibn-i-Abhar and the means of his comfort, this matter is acceptable before God. The sun of permission hath dawned from the heaven of divine laws and ordinances. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make all his deeds as one remembrance, a pure deed, and a resplendent light, that the Lord may assist him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance throughout all possibility. Verily He is the Helper, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you both and upon My loved ones in that land and upon those who are with you and who have hearkened unto your words concerning this Most Great Announcement and this Straight Path.</p>

<p>This is a Book which We have sent down in truth and made it the choice wine of utterance for all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and the Kawthar of generosity for all who are in the world, and the Salsabil of life for those who are seized with the thirst of separation when the horizon of reunion shone forth with the Luminary of My Name, the All-Subduing over all the worlds.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who has turned to God, and We cause him to hear My most sweet call and give him to drink of this luminous wine. As for those who have remained heedless of the Truth and His sovereignty - their names shall not be mentioned before the Throne, and they shall ere long return to their abode in the fire. He, verily, is the Just, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! The Object of your desire hath appeared, and He, verily, is the One promised in the Scriptures of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest the ornaments of the world debar you from God, the Lord of all names. Cast them behind you, turning your faces toward the court of your Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came with clear signs, He was opposed by those possessed of learning, and before Him, when the Spirit came, the doctors of the Torah turned away from Him and the people followed them until God raised Him to an exalted station. Thus was the matter decreed aforetime. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Hearken thou unto that which the Spirit hath imparted to the heart of the world: There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the verses of God time and again, and for having drunk the wine of knowledge from the hand of the favors of thy Lord while every froward oppressor turned away. Strive thou in the service of thy Master that there may appear from thee that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom and the dominion shall endure. This behooveth him who hath turned unto God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Make mention of My loved ones in that land and give them the joyful tidings of My gracious remembrance. We make mention of everyone who hath turned to the Countenance with a remembrance whereby their names shall be recorded in a preserved Tablet. By My life! Were they to know this bounty, they would soar on the wings of joy and turn with their hearts to the horizon of the Manifestation, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast enabled us to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation while He was imprisoned among the heedless ones.” Verily, upon thee and upon them be the glory from One Who is Mighty, Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>He is the Glorious, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>O thou who art yearning! Raise thy cry from the depths of thy soul that it may pierce the heart of the Beloved, and weep with thy spirit’s eyes that they may be illumined by the meeting with thy Love. Lament with thy burning heart that thou mayest behold the beauty of thy Friend, and be consumed with the fire of love that thou mayest, like unto a candle, be kindled by the comeliness of thy Beloved. Cast away the world of existence that thou mayest embrace the neck of thy Friend, and draw thy heart from heart that thou mayest grasp the tresses of thy Beloved. Set foot upon the circle of existence that thou mayest emerge from the point of thy purpose, and place thy head in the wilderness of nothingness that thou mayest enter the Egypt of reunion. Open thine ear that thou mayest hear the celestial call of the unseen realm, and purify thy spirit’s essence that thou mayest become aware of the mysteries in the privacy of thy Friend. Spread thy spiritual wings that thou mayest soar in the heaven of eternity, and ascend on holy spirit that thou mayest arrive at the spiritual court. Take a step with all thy soul that thou mayest find thy way to the presence of the Ancient Beauty. Draw a line around the world of the seen and unseen that thou mayest circle round thy goal.</p>
<p>I swear by the Spirit of eternity that if thou shouldst hear with the ear of understanding the melodies of the Dove from the ant of love, thou wouldst at once arise above the world of creation, and from the attraction of love thou wouldst sacrifice a hundred thousand thousand spiritual worlds of pure radiant light for the sake of thy Friend, and shed tears of blood from a hundred thousand eyes in thy longing for the beauty of thy Friend. Thou wouldst traverse limitless worlds through wilderness of destruction and thirst with the eye of thy being, that perchance thou mightest reach the valley of thy purpose, and spend countless ages waiting with thy soul, if haply thou mightest enter the intimate gathering of thy Beloved. Should thou become the spirit of eternity, thou wouldst hope to become but the dust at the blessed feet of thy Friend, and wert thou to become the sovereign of heaven, thou wouldst seek but a moment to serve thy Friend.</p>
<p>Allah-u-Akbar! How the candles of the spirit burn and blaze in the nights of separation from their longing to meet the Beloved, while we are occupied with thoughts of temporal day. How the holy eyes of the unseen realms rain blood from beholding the beauty of the Friend, while we are caught up in regarding the shell. The exalted steps of those near to God run through barren deserts, enduring a thousand thousand thorns in search of the Friend, while we repose in the shade of passion. The tender hearts have melted from the burning of separation from the Friend, while we rest comfortably in the cradle of sleep. Glory be to God! All the pure divine spirits have passed like lightning from the furthest realms without name or trace, while we have not taken a single step beyond the lowest degrees of self. All the luminous divine spirits have ascended to the highest reaches of eternal glory, while we have not emerged from the first degree of animal existence.</p>
<p>The spirit of being is astounded at what heedlessness has appeared and what turning away has occurred, that though a hundred thousand holy doves sing with intimate melodies in the atmosphere of reunion, not a single spirit is stirred nor does a single soul move. And if a hundred thousand waves of the fragrance of eternity and the perfume of light and the musk of divine favor were to be diffused through the world, not a single sweet fragrance would rise from creation. And if worlds of divine souls were all to perish and be annihilated, leaving but a single soul who would neither remember nor become detached - nay, I swear by the Spirit of heaven which is the Spirit of all spirits […]</p>
<p>By the Spirit of All Spirits and Soul of All Souls, see how that exalted Being and beloved Temple utterly sacrificed and effaced Himself, and how that pure and captivating Spirit gave His sweet life, and how those divine spirits - each of whose bodies was equal to all the spirits of the kingdom of earth and heaven - were sacrificed and effaced in the path of the Friend in countless ways of detachment. Observe how not a single soul hath yet remembered these momentous events and these supreme manifestations, from a single trace of which the heavens of the unseen are cleft asunder. If this weak gnat should soar like the Phoenix and ascend to the heaven of glory, and scatter a thousand thousand souls over creation, none would care to remember it. And if this contemptible fly should become like the mighty Simurgh and take wing in the atmosphere of grandeur, and beat its wings a hundred thousand times over every soul, not one heart would be stirred. And if this lost ant should become the Solomon of the kingdom of existence and place the ring of the Ultimate Purpose upon its finger, neither would it be drawn, nor would any being be attracted.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! I know not whether the friends of the realm of being have forgotten the tale of love, or whether the lovers in the sanctuary of rapture have concealed the scroll of passion. If the divine nightingales come not to sing in the days of union, then when will they come? And if the mystic nightingales remain silent in the season of the rose, in what season will they raise their song? If pure spirits perceive not today a fragrance from the hidden abode of immortal spirit, never shall they perceive it. At last did the sugar-garden of the eternal realm learn from the ruby cup of the highest heaven. O nightingales of the mystic land, where are ye? And the rose-garden of pure delicacy hath been revealed through the rapture of the manifest Beauty. O nightingales of mystical love, where are ye? The candle of immortality is lit in the assembly of the Friend - gather round, O moths! And the light of the divine countenance shineth from the brow of radiance - behold it, O ye enchanted by His beauty! The unseen Light of lights hath lifted the veil from the face of mystical beauty - how long will ye remain silent, O lovers in the valley of union? And the curling locks have emerged from beneath the veil - why do ye tarry, O ye heartless ones in the street of the Beloved?</p>
<p>The tree of paradise is in motion - O birds, it is time! The gates of the eternal realm are opened - O ye who are far from the wilderness of annihilation, it is time! The cupbearer of eternity standeth transfixed with the cup of meeting - make haste, O ye who thirst on the journey of destruction! The Ancient Beauty is seated upon the Most Great Throne - present yourselves before His face! The breezes of faithfulness from the morn of heaven bring joy - come to your senses, O ye who are drunk in the wilderness! The Sun of Beauty hath risen with all its rays from the dawning-place of the peerless horizon at the point of setting - enough of the slumber of heedlessness! Arise! The Beauty shall pass away in the pavilions of majesty, and at that time shall ye supplicate and cry out and weep. The Dove of the Spirit is upon the Tree of the Beloved - gather round, O faithful birds! The oceans of grace have been stirred by the breeze of the tresses of mercy - emerge, O pure essences, from the realm of primal and final causes, and become sanctified from the kingdom of eternity and perpetuity, that ye may perceive that spiritual and divine breeze from the sanctuary of inner meanings.</p>
<p>And became sanctified from the realm of eternal and everlasting things, that ye might hear that spiritual, divine breeze from the sanctuary of inner meanings, and inhale this sweet-scented perfume from the musk-laden tresses of faithfulness, that ye might make the morn of the Divine Presence sweet and spiritual through this gentle, ethereal breeze, and make the spirit of the eternal cloud fragrant and refreshed through this spiritual perfume. The worlds of the unseen Essence bestow their aromatic attraction through this musky fragrance, and the holy air of eternity is made fresh and new through this spiritual ambergris. Water the tresses of the Houri of the Paradise of intimacy with this fresh rose-water, and give radiance to the veils of the Holy Maiden with this pure, perfumed musk. O Zulaykha of the unseen chamber! Cast aside the veil of chaste modesty and come forth! The Joseph of the spirit of beauty hath appeared in the Egypt of light! O forsaken lover! Rend the garment of patience, for thy Beloved of union hath come!</p>
<p>O spirit of love! How long wilt thou tarry in patient restraint?</p>
<p>Set fire to all the horizons, strike at the very soul!</p>
<p>Like lovers, take His two sword-like eyebrows,</p>
<p>And strike at once at the neck of all existence!</p>
<p>Take these two eternal musk-filled pods of enchantment,</p>
<p>And strike the fragrance of life into all spirits!</p>
<p>Hearken! Give one call from the realm of the Friend’s perfect beauty,</p>
<p>Strike it into a hundred thousand nameless worlds!</p>
<p>Burn the veil of all the sanctuary of the unseen,</p>
<p>Then strike fire into the hiding place of the holy ones!</p>
<p>In a hundred thousand worlds of the holy, unseen night,</p>
<p>Strike the world aflame for the sake of the Friend’s name!</p>
<p>O slumbering liver! How long will you remain asleep in the heart of existence? Be thou consumed by this Fire which hath been kindled and set ablaze from the leaves of the Lote-Tree of the Desired One, Who stood upon the mountain of the habitation in fire with fire. O thou extinguished one! How long wilt thou remain in the well of limitations? Take hold of this cord of fuel, bind it firmly around the waist of thy soul, and with one mighty effort, like the wild rue in divine love, laugh and from the well ascend to the lofty realm of the spirit, until thou mayest lift thy hand beyond the placeless and above the placeless realm, and clasp the hand of the Friend, tear thy heart from pre-existence and eternity, and take possession of the heart. But how can this lost ant, in the presence of that praiseworthy attraction, make mention of the Beauty of the Desired One? Better it is that we should annihilate and negate all that exists and exists not in the world of being, and with the blessed melodies of the Friend, remind the subtle spirit. A tablet of the exalted and glorious melodies of the Beloved was inscribed for those other stations of holy spiritual nearness. Seize it with the hands of the spirit and observe it with the eye of the soul. O thou essence of the heart, be mindful! Perchance ye may hold fast to the cord of favor and cling to its hem, that ye may inhale the gentle breezes and ascend with holy spirits into the cloud of primordial light, that ye may take from this cup the perfection of divine mercy and the fullness of lordly grace, that ye may breathe the fragrances of detachment from the repository of inaccessibility and the treasury of exaltation, that we may perceive the breaths of the spirit of the divine cloud from the holy place and the radiance rising from the right hand of meeting the Friend, and turn our faces toward the Friend. At that moment we say: Verily, we are for the Friend, and verily, unto the Friend are we detached.</p>

<p>O Rajab-’Ali! Upon thee be my abundant greetings. Most of mankind have strayed far from truth, and the mortal world hath so deluded them that they have deemed the Reformer of the world to be a corrupter. They have turned away from light and cleaved unto darkness. They have accepted not a single word from the mine and dawning-place of truth. We have forbidden all the friends of God from contention and conflict, and commanded patience and forbearance. They accepted not the word of truth and move with utmost tyranny in the arena of oppression, heedless that the true Judge and the just Almighty observeth and will surely requite them.</p>
<p>O Rajab! Fix thy gaze upon this blessed word, which is as a spirit for the temple of detachment: His exalted Word: “Be thou for Me and I shall be for thee.” The world hath never been, nor will ever be, faithful. Cast away that which perisheth and take hold of that which endureth. Most of the people of Iran denied God’s great bounty and raised the swords of tyranny against the essence of justice. They wrought that which caused every seeing eye to weep and every living soul to lament.</p>

Whoso hath acknowledged Him hath acknowledged God from all eternity, and whoso hath turned away from Him hath turned away from God and from His Manifestations and from the Daysprings of His Beauty and the Dawning-Places of His might and power, and is accounted among the idolaters. Say: O people! How long will ye fail to be enkindled with the fire of God from this Fire that hath been ignited at the midmost heart of all regions? Beware lest ye deprive yourselves thereof and from drawing nigh unto it. By God! It is indeed a light and a mercy unto all the worlds. Fear ye God, O people, and be not veiled therefrom by the veils of idle fancy. Shatter the idols by the power of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, and be not of them that are far removed.</p>
<p>O thou physician of the Cause! Hearken unto the call of thy Beloved in these days wherein sorrows have encompassed Me through the hosts of Satan. By God! They have committed that which hath caused the pillars of existence and the foundations of the seen and unseen worlds to tremble. Were We to lift the veils and acquaint thee with what hath befallen the Beauty of the All-Chosen One, thou wouldst rend the garment of patience, and lament both night and day, and wouldst be consumed within thyself, and be numbered with them that are consumed. The Tongue of God speaketh even now, saying: “Is there any detached soul who will arise between earth and heaven and purify My surroundings from the defilement of these idolaters? And is there any possessed of spiritual perception who will inhale the fragrance of the All-Glorious from the Robe of Utterance through that which hath proceeded from the Pen of the Most Merciful, and be so carried away by the breezes of the Beloved that he will forsake all who dwell in the heavens and on earth, and stand firm in assisting this lonely Wronged One?” By My life! Were We to recount unto thee the tales of the Youth concerning what hath befallen Him, the Tablet would not suffice. We therefore return to that which thou didst ask in thy letter, wherein We found the fragrance of thy love for thy Ancient Lord. We beseech God to confirm thee in that wherein thou art engaged and to withhold thee not from that which He possesseth. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As concerning what thou hast asked about unity, hearken unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee, that it may draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt recognize all things in their proper place, soar in the atmosphere of wisdom and meaning, and attain unto the fountainhead of knowledge from One knowing and wise. Know thou that the philosophers have maintained that the all-pervading reality is identical with all things, as they have said “the simple reality is all things.” This is their doctrine, and they have adduced numerous proofs to establish it. Likewise have the mystics put forth statements concerning unity and the explanation of the station of abstraction. In this regard, he who was their exemplar among those who spoke of the unity of existence, and their model among those who affirmed the vision of Truth in every existing thing, hath said that the outward aspect of the Lord cannot be numbered and His inward aspect cannot be limited, that the outward can scarce be manifest and the inward can scarce be concealed. Many have followed him in this, likening this station to the sea and its waves, to ink and letters, to water and ice. We have foregone mention of the statements of both groups for the sake of brevity, and We make mention of that which is chosen by thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Apart from this, We have indeed expounded their statements in numerous epistles, and We beseech God to convey them unto thee, for He is the best of those who convey.</p>
<p>Know thou that with thy Lord all letters and words, and likewise mention and utterance, are of equal degree and one station. Even as He, exalted be He, distinguisheth between the letters of creation, so too doth He distinguish between the letters of law. Ponder thou upon this, that thou mayest be of them that are endued with insight. Whatsoever He decreeth in every age and dispensation is the truth, and naught else is but manifest error. For example, in the Psalms it was revealed from the heaven of the divine Command: “Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee,” while in the Qur’an it was revealed that He hath no offspring, that “He begetteth not, nor is He begotten,” and that He is independent of all worlds. Likewise unto Moses the Prophet, after he had beseeched his Lord saying “Show me Thyself, that I may look upon Thee,” He said “Thou shalt not see Me,” and at that same moment declared “Look and thou shalt behold Me.” Thus observe thou and be of them that bear witness.</p>
<p>These diverse statements return to a single point, and Our servants possessed of insight perceive no difference between them. Were the gate of this knowledge to be opened before the face of men, none would raise objections against God in these days wherein the Beauty of the Ancient of Days hath appeared with manifest signs and clear proofs. Through the diversity of utterance doth the All-Merciful distinguish between those who have recognized Him by His own Self and follow Him in all that proceedeth from Him, and those who have known the Word but are veiled thereby from the Beauty of the All-Glorious and are among the losers. Even as thou witnessest today certain people who profess the unity of God in the Bayan yet are veiled from Him Who hath expounded and revealed it, and thereby have they gone astray and led others astray, being of those who perceive not.</p>
<p>As for thee, purify thy heart from all that thou hast heard from these factions and turn unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Say: By God, the mention of unity and its exaltation above all stations is solely by virtue of its connection with God. Beware, O people, lest ye be veiled from Him around Whose command unity itself doth circle, and be ye of the God-fearing. How many are the servants who make mention of God and profess His unity throughout all their days […]</p>
<p>How many there are who glorify and unify Him throughout all days and nights, yet are among the most heedless of servants, for they recognize not Him Whom they unify at morn and eventide. And how many a believer in divine unity is today a polytheist before God, though he perceiveth it not within himself and is numbered among the idolaters. Consider, for example, the philosophers and the leading figures among the Shaykhis - they established four degrees of divine unity: unity of Essence, then of Attributes, of Actions, and of Worship. They bid people to believe in their doctrines and have written numerous books to prove these four degrees. Yet they remain veiled from Him Whose knowledge they sought to prove to themselves. Thus do thou witness, O people of the Bayan, and be of those who know. How many servants there are who possess not what others possess and are unaware of the degrees of divine unity and the proofs adduced by men, yet they recognized their Creator on the day of His Manifestation. These are the true believers in divine unity, and their names are inscribed as the faithful on preserved tablets of glory. The purpose of divine unity in the tablets of God is the servant’s acknowledgment that He was and is one in His Essence, having no partner or peer in His Being or in what proceedeth from Him throughout all creation. Thus did He testify to His own Self before the creation of all things and before the appearance of names and their kingdom. There is no God but He, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Powerful. If thou wouldst soar on wings of holiness in the atmosphere of nearness and detachment and be attracted by the fragrances of intimacy, thou wouldst attain unto a station wherein thou wouldst witness naught in creation save the effulgence of the rays of the Beloved, and wouldst hear all things cry out that there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Behold the sun - it shineth upon all things with a single effulgence and its radiant light is reflected in the mirrors of all created things. The true believer in divine unity is he whom the veils of these mirrors do not prevent from witnessing the One Who hath manifested Himself through them, in them, and by their own selves. Likewise observe the Sun of Truth and be of them that see. It hath dawned upon all who are in the heavens and on earth, and the true believer in divine unity beholdeth in all created things naught but a sign of his Lord’s revelation, possessing at all times a wondrous insight. They who have today taken partners with God are far removed from the gardens of nearness and are counted among the idolaters. Whosoever possesseth vision and understanding witnesseth in all that hath appeared from Him the signs of His power, the manifestations of His sovereignty, and the evidences of His grandeur, which all created things are powerless to comprehend. The true believer in divine unity in these days is he who uniteth God in this Revelation and testifieth within himself that there is no God but He, Who hath ever been One in His Essence, Who hath never been joined with anyone nor shared with any soul, and all else besides Him is created by His binding and wise command. Say: Beware, O people, lest ye fashion for yourselves a new god each day. Fear ye God and speak not according to your desires. Fear God and be of them that truly believe in His unity.</p>
<p>Know thou concerning what was asked about the mind, the soul and the spirit that these three and their like which are mentioned in reference to man are manifestations of that sign by which man was established. Exalted be this creation which tells of its Creator, and the hearts of the mature have failed to know it as it truly is. For instance, that by which thou movest, hearest and seest is one, even if thou namest it by all names, as it has been called by different names by the tongues of those who remember. Yet in its essence it is sanctified above all that people speak of and all that they attribute to it. However, its manifestations and names differ according to the recipient and the means. For example, when it is directed to the place of hearing and its means, an effect, attribute and name appear, and when directed to the place of sight and the means ordained for it, another effect and attribute appear. This ye witness within yourselves and are among those who bear witness. All this is from its orientation toward the outward means in the human temple. Likewise consider the inward and be among those who observe. For instance, its connection to the heart, liver, spleen, head and other parts - through the differences in these stations different attributes and distinct names appear, just as ye name it mind, soul and spirit, and it has become known by these names among the worlds.</p>
<p>Therefore know thou the sign of thy Lord’s revelation which was revealed to thee through thee - how from it, though it is one in its essence, different names and effects have appeared - that thou mayest thereby reach the stations of knowledge in this Paradise whose trees were planted by the hands of the All-Glorious, from which the fragrances of the All-Merciful waft, and by which the hearts of the pure ones are attracted, were they to be of those who turn. And that thou mayest witness that differences appear through differences in recipient and means, otherwise the Revealer is one and the revelation is one. All this We have deposited within yourselves that ye may soar in the holy and detached gardens, then in unveiling and unity, and be of those who have rent the veils and emerged from behind the veil through the sovereignty of My Name whereby God distinguished between the monotheists and the polytheists.</p>
<p>However, among the people of terminology and convention from among the philosophers and others, there are various explanations concerning the mind, soul and spirit. Since We found no opportunity, We did not address what they mentioned and We condensed what was intended to the utmost degree. Thus did the matter flow from One powerful and knowing. Were anyone to reflect on what We have truly revealed, the door of knowledge would open before his face and the maiden of inner meanings would emerge in the chambers of wisdom with such an ornament as would perplex the minds of those brought near. And We shall detail for him what We condensed such that from every letter of what was revealed We bring forth for him books which none has encompassed save God, the Counter, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O physician of oneness! Come forth from the chambers of stillness with God’s greatest medicine and heal all created things through the mention of thy Lord’s name, the Healer, the Forgiving, the Generous. And if thou findest one heedless, treat him with the mention of the Most Great Name, for by it every sick and ailing one is healed. And if thou seest one athirst with love, guide him to the ocean of attainment through novel counsel and wisdom. Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act thou according to what thou hast been commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning the Truth and the Path, know thou that in these days the Path is the Most Great Name of the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate, for through it are people guided to the hidden, treasured, and concealed Reality that is veiled from the worlds. Say: Verily it is God’s path between the heavens and earth, and God’s way in the kingdom of Command and Creation, and the manifestation of Truth among all created things. And in one sense, Truth referreth to the Primal Point of Will, the First Emanation, the First Pearl, the Most Exalted Word, the First Remembrance, and the Act from which the worlds derive their sustenance. And whatsoever guideth people and connecteth them to the station of true knowledge is the Path. Though this Path is one, it differeth according to the capacities of those who seek it. As thou observest, among the people are those who recognized God merely upon hearing of His Manifestation; some upon attaining the presence of His Countenance; others believed after hearing what was revealed from the direction of the Throne and were numbered among the guided ones; some clung to proofs and arguments, tarrying upon the path and were among those who hesitated; and others traversed the way in less than the twinkling of an eye and reached the most great vista, the station whereon the Ancient Beauty was established with manifest sovereignty. Blessed is he who passeth over the path as lightning through the clouds and followeth the most great path in this mighty Announcement. Say: O people! The path of truth is manifest like unto His own being. Beware lest ye stray into the ways of those who associated partners with God and follow the paths of the deniers. He who is today seized by the fragrances of the All-Merciful and findeth the holy fragrance from the garment of My Most Glorious Name shall be so attracted that he will know neither path nor way, and will reach the Sun of Eternity in less than a moment. And in one station, the Path is My verses and the Truth is My hidden and concealed Self, secreted from the eyes of the heedless. Know thou further that the Manifestation in its essence is sanctified above all universality and particularity, and is one in its reality. Those who have ascended unto it and upon whose hearts are impressed the lights of the revelation of the Manifestation - these are the proofs of His Self, the ways of His guidance, the mines of His wisdom, the dawning-places of His Cause, and the daysprings of His revelation. All names and attributes may be applied to them so long as they remain oriented toward the Sun of Manifestation. After turning aside, no station remaineth for them with God and they are numbered among the losers. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thou mayest thank God, thy Lord, and aid Him in these days wherein the hosts of Satan have encompassed Him. And the Glory be upon thee and upon every discerning believer.</p>

<p>O thou who art wronged! The Wronged One remembereth thee and calleth unto thee from His Most Great Prison, and announceth unto thee the grace of God, the Lord of all worlds. O thou who art wronged! There hath befallen thee in the path of God that which hath caused grief. The whole world awaiteth this Day, and yet they curse and revile those tyrannous souls who in the past inflicted injustice upon the Manifestations of Divine Unity, while they themselves are engaged in that which no oppressor from the beginning of creation until now hath ever perpetrated. The Divine Lamp shineth resplendent before all faces, and the ocean of bounty surgeth on the right hand of all beings, yet they remain unaware and ask when the Lamp will appear and when the Sun of Truth will dawn and when the ocean of mercy will surge. Such is the state of the people and the leaders of the earth. All that hath come to pass and continueth to come to pass hath as its cause and origin the ignorant ones of the earth who have become known for their learning. Fie upon them and upon those who follow them without any clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be not grieved at what hath befallen thee. By My life! Greater than this hath befallen the Self of Truth. Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken, as a token of His grace, that thou mayest hear and be of the thankful ones. The glory be upon thee and upon him who hath borne hardships in the path of God, the Most High, the Most Great, and hath taken the cup of tribulation in the name of his Lord, the Most Glorious, and hath drunk therefrom at one time for love of Him and at another in remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

<p>O Most Holy and Most Great! This is a mention from Us to him who has drawn nigh unto the ocean of divine knowledge and drunk therefrom in My Name, the All-Merciful, that the remembrance of the Worshipped One may attract him to the Praiseworthy Station. Bear thou witness, O servant, to that which God did testify before imprisonment and after imprisonment and when His throne was established in the prison, that there is none other God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Reflect upon God’s power and dominion. When We entered into prison, We summoned the kings with a sovereignty that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, and commanded them to abandon what they possessed, turning unto God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved. The tribulations hindered Us not from that which We purposed in the kingdom of creation. We manifested the proof through a power from Us and sent forth the wondrous One with a sovereignty that subdued all existence, and with Him that which We named the Cry, whereat hearts and minds were sorely shaken. Can the turning of Pharaohs or the fleeing of Caesars prevent Us? Nay, by the Lord of all creation! Verily He hath manifested His Cause and will manifest it as He pleaseth. Neither thousands can veil it nor swords impede it. Blessed art thou for having followed thy father in the Cause of thy Lord and for having drunk of My choice-sealed wine. Soon will he who denieth it today drink thereof. Tomorrow thou shalt behold him taking the cup of utterance in My Name, the All-Merciful. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. None hath any escape, nor hath any soul a resting place. The Day of God hath appeared and He Who encompasseth all existence shall judge therein. Be thou thankful unto God for having heard, turned unto Him and recognized thy wronged Lord. Arise to serve thy father, for this is among the most meritorious deeds in the preserved Book. Verily he hath a station with God. We send Our greetings upon his face from this forbidden spot.</p>

<p>O Haji Darvish, may God, the Most High, strengthen you! He is the One Who hath commanded all to observe justice and fairness. The station of fairness requireth that no matter be accepted save through direct vision - that is to say, that man should witness with his own eyes and gain knowledge thereof. The intention is that one should not be content with mere hearsay regarding the Manifestation and its degrees. For twelve hundred years the divines of Persia made mention of the Qa’im and invoked “may God hasten His advent”, yet when the Light of the Bayan shone forth from the horizon of the Will of the All-Merciful, all, whether learned or ignorant, pronounced Him an infidel and issued the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood. This matter is clear and evident to all. Furthermore, not one among all these divines possessed knowledge equal even to a needle’s eye, as evidenced by their complete unawareness of that Essence of Being while He was still in the loins. Indeed, should anyone have made mention of this station, declaring that He must be born, they would have issued the decree for his death and shed his blood. The purpose of what hath been mentioned is that they should not be content with the words of those who have turned away from the people of the Bayan. They should observe for the sake of God, speak for the sake of God, and reflect for the sake of God. The aforementioned souls are utterly unaware of the root of the Cause.

The divine verses are effectual: in one station they are the Water of Life for the servants, and in another they are the Teacher of all created things. Were their attributes and effects to be mentioned, a mighty book would appear.</p>
<p>We have made mention of thee from My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book as among those who have remained faithful to My Covenant and My Testament, and who throughout their lives have spoken My beauteous praise. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My greatest mercy be upon thee and upon those who hearken unto the proofs of the teachers and follow the Command of God, the Ordainer, the Wise.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning One from the horizon of the Kingdom! Today it behoveth each one of the people of God to pass beyond the gulf of names, through divine strength and power, that they may find their way to the Most Great Ocean. Consider ye the peoples of former ages and centuries: certain souls who clung to names and who, night and day, occupied themselves with disputation and opposition, accounting themselves the most learned of all peoples and the most excellent of all nations. Yet when the dawn of the Day of His Manifestation broke forth and the Intended One appeared, all arose to shed His pure blood, save a few among the Shaykhis who attained. We beseech God to aid thee in all that befitteth His Day. The Supreme Pen beareth witness that today the veiled ones of the Bayan are many times more heedless than that party. Guard thyself from the whisperings of these souls through the name of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him and acted according to that which was enjoined in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them that have clung fast unto God, detached from the world and all that is therein. Verily, such a one is of the people of the highest Paradise and of the Crimson Ark. He Who speaketh in every condition testifieth unto this, that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-i-Tahir! Rejoice that the Most Great Ocean hath turned toward thee and desireth to cast upon thee, from the precincts of His mighty prison, the pearls of the All-Merciful’s utterance. By the life of God! A single letter of that which hath been sent down in truth cannot be equaled by aught else, nor by all that the kings and rulers possess. When thou receivest My letter and findest from it the fragrance of My loving-kindness, arise, turn toward My direction and say: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art imprisoned, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>
<p>O Tahir! We were with thee and witnessed thy acceptance and heard thy call. We have sent thee this Tablet that thou mayest hear My sweetest call, which God hath made the water of life for all who dwell within the realm of possibility, and the choice sealed wine for those who observe what they have been commanded in My perspicuous Book. He who serveth My loved ones and dealeth with them in kindness is as one who hath attained unto My service - this verily is a great station. What thou hast done in God’s path hath been accepted. Rejoice thou and be of those who render thanks.</p>

<p>Regarding the mention of prayer from the horizon of will shining forth, if God should will, He will send down […]</p>
<p>In mentioning the name of Allah, the Trusted One, upon him be the glory of God, the King, the Manifest Truth. We beseech God to assist him and make him among those servants through whom the earth has been filled with the traces of God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Convey infinite greetings from this evanescent servant to them. The remainder of the blessed Surih of the Temple which they had requested will, God willing, be sent later.</p>
<p>Regarding his honor Aqa Siyyid Baqir, upon him be the glory of God, convey most elevated greetings, and what they have intended is most praiseworthy, however they have said that its time has not yet come. If in these days they would proceed to those regions with Tablets and engage in teaching, it would be closer to piety, and afterwards, God willing, numerous books will be sent from the Seat of Revelation. Convey greetings to them from God.</p>
<p>Regarding his honor Karbala’i Karim, it was mentioned in the presence of His Countenance, and a mighty Tablet was revealed for him from the direction of the Throne which, God willing, will be sent. Convey infinite greetings to all from this servant.</p>
<p>And regarding what you had written and inquired about certain phrases - whatever is revealed of divine verses, this servant mostly writes them in His presence, and often they are revealed in such a manner that no one is capable of writing them, for when once measured, one thousand two hundred verses were revealed in an hour. In such case, all are powerless to write, and this servant might possibly write eight hundred in an hour. For half an hour the hand cooperates, and in the other half it moves involuntarily. Therefore, sometimes they are revealed at a pace that allows this servant to manage the writing, and whatever is revealed is not reviewed by the Most Holy Gaze, though sometimes they are recited again in His presence. Hence, in some instances there may be errors in spelling and letters. Moreover, the scribes make many mistakes, for error and mistake have been and will be in human nature. Just as in these days four copies of the Book of Badi’ have been written, and although they were compared and checked, nevertheless one day by chance one of those copies was present before His Countenance. He looked at some of it and found several instances where letters were mistaken, and likewise several places where the spelling was wrong. Afterwards He commanded that it be carefully examined and compared. It became apparent that in most pages there were mistakes and omissions. Therefore it is very necessary that they be attentive with care so that it becomes correct. And your honor’s explanation regarding the mentioned words was presented before His presence. From the mouth of the Divine Will these luminous words shone forth: “Excellent is what thou hast asked. Verily, He is with His benevolent servants and answers the prayers of the supplicants.”</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst ask, hearken unto what hath been revealed in truth from One mighty and all-knowing. The word ‘sha?idh’ with an unclean nature is permissible, and as for ‘sadhij’ with ‘dhal’, it is known among the people, but the Primal Point - may my soul be a sacrifice for all else besides Him - wrote ‘sazij’, therefore I do not wish to change whatsoever hath appeared from my Beloved. Thus we referred it to the pen of the scribes - whatever flows is correct, even if different versions have flowed from their pens. Verily He is the Establisher of orthography and words, He ordaineth as He pleaseth. However, this station hath been and shall ever be exclusively reserved for the Truth, exalted be His mention, not as observed from certain ignorant ones who have not been vouchsafed a single letter of knowledge, yet write fabricated words and attribute them to the Truth, as the chief of prevaricators wrote a letter to someone and sent it before His presence - most expressions therein were erroneous both in meaning and word, including writing ’Umar and Zayd with hamza. Would that people would ponder the words of that polytheist - most are nonsensical and meaningless. A fire for those who have taken him as lord besides God.</p>
<p>In these days, Tablets have been revealed from the Source of the Cause in response to one of the opposers who had objected to the letter of Aqa Mirza Jamalu’d-Din, upon him be the glory of God. A copy thereof was sent from the Most Holy Court as a favor to His servant. Specifically, Janab-i-Aqai Aqa Siyyid Mahdi, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, was commanded to write and send it to that person. And from the Source of the Cause it was commanded that a copy of that Tablet be sent specifically to the land of Kha to Janab-i-A?daq, upon him be the glory of God. Since the original objection was made by Haji Muhammad Karim Khan, it is therefore very beneficial for the Shaykhis who have somewhat turned towards the Truth. God willing, He may bring about through this a matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in some Tablets it was observed that ‘qiba’’ was written as ‘biqa’‘. Surely in the Book of Badi’ too, which they brought to that direction, it is ‘biqa’’ - He changed it. Similarly ‘hashim mu?ta?ir’ which should be written with ‘?a’. In any case, there are many differences in the writings of scribes. They must observe with utmost care that it be written correctly.</p>
<p>And when previously the Blessed Book arrived, the names of the people of Ya were mentioned therein, specifically all exalted Tablets were revealed. It remains to be seen when it is destined to be sent.</p>
<p>And another Most Holy command is that the Book of Badi’ should be sent for Janab-i-Aqa Siyyid Mirza who is present in the land of Ya. Send the books bound, for unbound is not beloved. Janab-i-Aqa Mirza Ja’far, upon him be the glory of God, hath submitted to your presence that Janab-i-Ismu’llah al-Munir, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, [has written] a copy of the Book of Badi’ [for this servant]. If completed, it should be sent specifically to Janab-i-Qasim Khan.</p>
<p>And the remembrance and the glory and the might and the grandeur be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among God’s sincere servants. Convey endless greetings from the servant to all the loved ones of God, and greetings be upon thee and upon them.</p>

<p>O Sarah Khatun, upon whom be the Glory of God! Consider:</p>
<p>All praise, glorification, mention and utterance befitteth the Object of all possibility, Who hath graciously aided His handmaidens and guided them until they attained unto the Straight Path and the Great Announcement. How many among the great ones and the learned are today heedless of the Self-Subsisting and deprived of the Choice Wine that is sealed. This is the meaning of the former word which declareth: “He maketh the highest to be lowest, and the lowest to be highest.” His loving-kindness hath encompassed all, His mercy hath preceded all things, and He hath created countless means whereby He might lead that honored handmaiden, through the attraction of His call, to the Most Exalted Horizon. He is the One Who hath power to draw the faithful to the heaven of nearness and to consign the wayward to the nethermost fire. His is the power, the strength, the majesty and the glory. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant beheld your letter. In truth, it was not a letter but rather a casket of divine love, for after breaking its seal and opening it, the fragrance of love for the Object of the world’s desire and the Beloved of all nations wafted therefrom. No mention, description or utterance can do justice to this station. Whatever might be said would be unworthy in the eyes of them that possess insight. Praise be to the Object of the world’s desire, Who enabled that leaf to attain unto the recognition of the Blessed Tree on a day when most of the earth’s inhabitants were seen to be debarred and deprived thereof. This is of God’s grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>After it was read and its contents made known, it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of Eternity and the Most Great Announcement, and was honored to be heard by Him. These are His blessed and exalted words: “O My handmaiden! Praise be to God that thou hast turned unto Him and attained unto the recognition of the Truth, exalted be His glory. In one station He is the Choice Wine that is sealed, the Kawthar that is mentioned, the River of Mercy, the Salsabil of grace, and the Tasnim of loving-kindness. Divine bounty encompasseth all and His mercy hath preceded all things. He hath enabled every one who hath turned unto Him to attain unto the traces of His Most Exalted Pen and hath guided them to the Most Glorious Horizon. The world of existence was created for the sake of attaining unto this Day, yet all remain deprived and debarred from the cause of their creation and its purpose, save whom God willeth.”</p>
<p>Your numerous trust offerings, both small and great, are present and visible before God. They have reached the True Trustee and now abide beneath the shade of the Tree of Divine Mercy, blessed by the light of the Morn of His presence. Blessed are they and blessed art thou, O My handmaiden. Rejoice thou in this manifest grace and this supreme loving-kindness.</p>
<p>We convey greetings to the handmaidens of that land and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgent lights of the Sun of Revelation. We beseech God to grant success to all in showing forth the greatest steadfastness and to assist them in that which He loveth and is pleased with. The Glory be upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have believed in the All-Informed Single One. Thanks be to God that those honored women have attained unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. They must, throughout the nights and days, make mention of this most great bounty and voice their praise and thanksgiving unto the Goal of all the worlds. I beseech His Exalted Being to assist thee and draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions, and to provide thee with that which He hath sent down from the heaven of His bounty and the atmosphere of His generosity - the food of His knowledge. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great. I make mention of the leaves and handmaidens of that land and summon them to the greatest steadfastness, and I beseech from God, exalted be His Glory, confirmation and assistance for all. The Glory, the Remembrance and the Praise be upon thee and upon them and upon every handmaiden who hath risen up, remained steadfast and hath said: “God is my Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”</p>

<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for Thy love! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the Lamp which was kindled in the heart of creation, and which was surrounded by the winds of sorrow, and which, whenever the tempestuous winds passed over it, increased in its radiance through Thy sovereignty and might, to make him who has arisen to aid Thy Cause a fire unto the hearts of the Messengers and a light unto the hearts of those who have turned towards Thee. O Lord! Protect him through Thy protection, aid him through Thy assistance, make him a promoter of Thy verses, an expounder of Thy laws and ordinances. Furthermore, I beseech Thee, O my God, to make us as one soul, one remembrance, and one pillar standing firm, that we may unite to manifest Thy sovereignty, demonstrate Thy power, and exalt Thy Cause.

<p>It was previously submitted that a circle would be sent, the details of which are as follows: The origin of this circle existed before, and at the beginning of the Manifestation of the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - permission was granted to some to keep it with them specifically for protection and countless affairs. However, its greatest pillar remained concealed and was not completed except in this most mighty, most holy, and most wondrous Revelation. It has come to the blessed attention and specifically permitted that you are authorized to give it to whomever you wish. Previously, one mithqal of gold was set as an offering for this circle, but His Holiness the Exalted - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - granted a reduction. The purpose of the offering is for the person who receives the circle. The Manifestations of Truth have never had, nor will ever have, any attachment to this world and what it contains. Whoever received it would spend it, on behalf of the Truth, either for those they knew to be deserving or for other beneficial purposes they deemed appropriate. However, the actual drawing of it requires some effort - they must be very careful that it is correct in every aspect. You are authorized to implement it in whatever manner you deem appropriate. It may also be written on paper - there is no harm in this. It was written specifically for you on cloth for durability. Whoever wishes to carry it should sit in a private place, recite the Verse of Power which is in the first circle (previously the Throne Verse was written in its place), recite the Divine Names which are in the second circle, and then recite the prayer written in the figure at the center of the circle. Afterward, with complete attention, detachment, and turning to God, they should take it and fold it, and while folding it, recite nineteen times “He is the Protector, the Helper, the Succourer, the All-Assisting.” Then they should not open it again, but keep it with them wrapped in wax paper and sewn in another cloth. It may be carried on the head, chest, or arm - the main purpose is that it should be with them, and they are permitted to carry it in whatever manner they wish.</p>

<p>This is what We saw in a dream, and We recount it truthfully that it may be a remembrance for all the peoples of the world. We were walking in the House on a pitch-dark night. At times We gazed upon the Most Great Scene, and at other times I contemplated the pearls of nightly discourse, and at times the unique gems of destiny, and yet again I spoke to it of the lessons that had befallen Me, until the dawn broke forth with a smile. Then slumber overtook Me, and I reclined upon a pillow for but a brief moment. I saw thee standing before Me, with a radiant countenance, gazing upon thy Lord. The Face of God turned toward thee and magnified thee. Then there flowed from the mouth of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Kawthar of inner meanings and utterance, in such measure as none in all the worlds could reckon. And at the end of the discourse, We commanded thee, from the presence of the Lord of Lords, to convey His Cause among His creatures. And amidst what We commanded thee, We saw the Trusted One standing at the side of this manifest Scene with a luminous and joyous countenance, and We commanded him as We had commanded thee, and We recited unto him this most exalted Word which the All-Merciful had made as a brilliant gem upon the brow of utterance: “O servant! Know thou the value of these days. Verily, the sojourn of the All-Merciful among the peoples of the worlds is like unto the duration of the rose in the garden.” And We repeated these words in that state until the hem of darkness grew thin and the fingers of destiny rent asunder the veil of heaven. Then sleep effaced the sign of wakefulness. We arose and said: “The Command belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Summoning.” And while We were dictating to the servant present before Us, We imparted unto him that which We have left unmentioned in the Tablet for the sake of brevity. Then did trembling seize him, and he was transformed by the wine of these words which gleamed like unto lamps in the crystal glasses of the words of the Lord of Names and Attributes. We said unto him: “Verily, in sipping the pure water from the goblets of success are signs for them that are wakeful.” And We beseech the Lord of Creation to wrap you both in the mantle of righteousness and to make you and them that have believed standards of guidance amidst all creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be befitting unto the Desired One Who, through His blessed, goodly and pure Word, created beings illumined with compassion, with mercy, with love. They are familiar with all tongues and are truthful in them all. Intrigues and evil whisperings are rejected in their religion. They are intimate with truthfulness and flee from all else. Whatsoever proceedeth from them is a faithful witness to the sincerity of their intention and the truth of their reality. We hope that the world may be illumined by the lights of the faces of the sincere ones and those brought nigh, and that these impurities which, like unto clay, have become the cause of the contamination of existence, may be cleansed by the Kawthar of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds, and that the path may become manifest and the way evident.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to unite the hearts of the friends in that land, to bestow fellowship upon them, and to illumine them with the light of trust and resignation. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Thy noble letters, each like unto the morning star, illumined the horizons of hearts. After they were read and noted, they were taken to the Presence and attained the honor of His attention. He said: “O Muhammad, upon thee be My peace! That which is acceptable and desired before the True One today is the preservation of the reputation of the friends of God in that land, that through the grace of the Lord and the requirements of His Name, the All-Merciful and the Lord of all, their reputation may encompass the world, and every region may acquire trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and sincerity from the dawning-places of that land. The nature of this world is known and evident, and its transitoriness is manifest and obvious to every possessor of vision and understanding. In the city of love one matter hath become apparent, and that was the martyrdom of Him Who is mentioned in the Tablets. The friends, in view of the prohibition against interference which was revealed from the Supreme Pen, did not interfere and held fast unto beautiful patience and glorious concealment. Glory be to God! Through the supreme oppression, the True One, exalted be His glory, hath aided His Cause and informed both East and West. We hope that all the friends will hold fast unto that which God hath desired.</p>
<p>God willing, confident and steadfast souls shall become the cause of the exaltation of the Word and the advancement of existence, and in every place and station they shall quench and extinguish the fire of hatred, animosity, rebellion and immorality with the pure water of patience, steadfastness, reliance and detachment. These few days have no significance in the sight of God and His friends. The man of insight will assuredly not defile himself beneath it nor soil his most pure hem. Blessed are they who came with joy and passed with fragrance, and with complete trust returned unto the Desired One.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The friends of that land and its surroundings are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and are illumined by the light of utterance. Convey greetings to all of them and gladden them with the effulgences of the lights of the Luminary of divine gifts and favors. Verily, He will assist thee, aid thee and help thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. There is no God but He, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that He granted success and power to this indigent one to be engaged in service to His Cause in the nights and days, detached from all else. How excellent is the work of those who are nigh and sincere, for therein is cut off and forbidden the fragrance of seeking personal desires. His is the grace and the bounty, and His the generosity and the glory. The power of the world and the desires of nations did not prevent Him, nor hold Him back from His prevailing and supreme Will. Exalted be His dominion and exalted be His power! With one word He gave life, and with another word He took it away. Who can say why or wherefore, save he who removes himself from His sovereignty and flees from His dominion? Such a one has no station, no mention, and no description. In truth, such beings are considered non-existent and lost in the sight of those firmly established in the Crimson Ark. In any case, this servant beseeches the one true God on your behalf for that which is the cause of eternal life. Verily, He is the Powerful, the All-Seeing, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. There is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>As commanded, a letter was written at this time to his honor Aqa ’Ali, upon him be the peace of God and His favors, and was sent to that true loved one that he might consider it and, if deemed advisable, deliver it. We beseech God to protect him through His power and sovereignty and to make him among the helpers.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding Port Said and Egypt and other places, from meeting that beloved of hearts in any land, God willing, fruits will appear therefrom and the light of love will shine forth. In every matter and every thing there is a trace and hidden treasure from God’s perfect power, but these gradually appear through outward means day after day, and the effects themselves make the servants aware and inform them. Verily God has power over all things. God willing, from the warmth of love of that beloved one, the effects of warmth will appear in all regions.</p>
<p>His Holiness the Afnan, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah’s] Most Great Glory, has always been and continues to be mentioned. In truth, they are the cause of the exaltation of the Cause. We beseech God to assist him and make him successful through a sovereignty from His presence. Verily He is the Powerful, the Wise.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Minister, may God the Blessed, the Most High, strengthen him, praise be to God, is sanctified from that which is unworthy and adorned with that which is worthy and befitting. God willing, may he be assisted in exalting this Most Great Cause. According to the command, that beloved one must in all conditions hold fast to wisdom and utterance. Meeting itself, without words, affects some receptive souls - it guides without speech and shows the way without description. Such a minister must be appreciated and, to the extent possible, love, affection, sincerity and purity toward him are necessary. This party must ask God for his honor and elevation. Verily God is the Hearing, the Seeing.</p>
<p>And as for the Khan, may God make him successful, God willing he is praiseworthy in deed, praised in mention, and beloved in utterance. Thanks be to God that He has servants who are adorned with the ornaments of truthfulness, purity, love and faithfulness. Mention was made of the honored Haji and the details of attendance in that blessed presence, and certainly it is blessed, for it was a gathering of the friends. Every spot of earth where God is mentioned takes pride over other spots. This is a truth in which there is no doubt. Although that spot in those days was sorrowful, for due to the sorrow of his honor the Haji and those with him, upon them be the glory of God, those with penetrating vision observed the friends and acquaintances to be grief-stricken. However, the revealed tablets, from the horizon of each of which the sun of bounty was shining, transformed all sadness into joy, gladness, delight and expansion.</p>
<p>And as to what you wrote about performing a prostration of gratitude after reading - glory be to God! The fragrance of this gratitude certainly ascended and attained the most exalted station. They commanded: Mention these words: I swear by the Sun of Truth which has illumined the worlds of justice and fairness and the hearts and minds of the companions - if the veil were lifted and that station were beheld, they would manifest such joy as has had and has no likeness in the world. Verily it has attained and ascended to a station where, upon its arrival, the maidens called out from the chambers: “The fragrance of a leaf of the Blessed Tree has wafted! Rejoice at meeting it and be glad at its presence!” By the life of God, the attraction of this tribulation seized everyone in the Most Glorious Paradise and the Supreme Heaven. Verily God is the Bestower, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to His Honor, the beloved of hearts, Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be God’s peace and care. In truth, his loving remembrances attract hearts and souls. I beseech God, exalted be His grace, to grant him that which causes the descent of mercy and favor from the clouds of His generosity and bounty. And for myself I seek confirmation that each time I make mention of what is hidden in the heart, I may remember the other loved ones of that land, and for each one I beseech God’s assistance. How beloved in the sight of God is the manifestation of love between His loved ones! When mention was made of His Honor Haji ’Abbas, upon him be God’s peace - how during the days of tribulation he was aflame with love in the house of His Honor the Haji and stood with complete dedication in service - repeatedly did He say: “Blessed is he, again blessed is he!” We must be engaged day and night in thanksgiving and praise that He bestowed His grace, showed the way, and granted glory. The utter abasement that was specially reserved for this community in Iran - now, praise be to God, some have realized that this community has another purpose and another aspiration: they have had and have no thought save the tranquility of nations and the prosperity of the world. Every person of insight testifies to this and every hearing ear acknowledges it. And if some clods of earth, due to their lack of fairness and justice, have spoken or may speak otherwise, they are outside the school of God’s justice. His bestowals, favors and kindness have reached such a degree that the tongues of the world are powerless to mention them.</p>
<p>One day He repaired to the garden where a new pavilion of glory had been raised, and by His command the loved ones were present and gathered in that place. After His will was made known and all were assembled, He proceeded from the first garden with the Branches of the Blessed Tree to that spot. After being seated and the reading of heavenly verses, He made such mention of recent tribulations that all became sorrowful. Then He spoke other words that truly caused sanctified spirits to attempt ascension that they might, after their ascent, attain to such a gathering. And in those two days when truly the sun of favor rose manifest from its horizon, there appeared all that testified to His supreme grace and mighty compassion, and in His presence was done what was befitting. Verily God, our Lord and your Lord, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous; He is the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention of that beloved of hearts’ charitable deeds was repeatedly made by the blessed tongue. Indeed, not even to the extent of a needle’s eye has anyone’s reward been or will be lost. He said that from the earliest days until now, Muhammad has stood firm in service and held fast to the cord of grace, and throughout this long period nothing appeared from him contrary to His good-pleasure. This is a description for which the highest Paradise and loftiest Heaven yearn. At this point we should say: “Praise be to God Who confirmed and assisted you and caused to appear from you that which the Lord of creation and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen described. We beseech God to make you a key to every door, steadfast in every matter, and mindful at all times. Verily He is the Most Powerful of the powerful. There is no God but He, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p>The other gifts of that Beloved One have arrived. As they have been blessed with the mention and remembrance of that Beloved One, they will surely be acceptable. Since their relation is to the True One, exalted be His glory, each of their pages is the envy of paradise. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to establish their reward in the garden of inner meanings and utterance, and to manifest its effusions in the aforementioned garden - this is not difficult for Him. This servant testifies to His power and sovereignty, His might and authority, and beseeches Him to ordain for your honor the good of all worlds among His worlds. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>To the light of the heart, His Honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of creation, I offer greetings and praise, and with utmost sincerity I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid him at all times and seasons in His service - a service that will forever bear witness to his attention, devotion, love and steadfastness. In the gathering of lovers his mention has been and continues to be made. It is hoped that in the remaining days we may arise to serve collectively and occupy ourselves with that which God desires. Verily, He is the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that this letter ends with his mention. This ending is paired with the beginning; indeed, in one sense it can be said to take precedence, for the station of His Holiness the Seal (upon him be the spirit of all else) from the first beginning that was the beginning, is beyond all description and praise. This is the one who mentions and this is the witness. The remembrance and praise of God be upon you, O dawning-places of love and affection and mines of love and unity. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Munificent.</p>
<p>The loved ones and chosen ones of that land are remembered in the heart and preserved through the protection of God’s favor, exalted be His glory. The world of love requires at all times the mention and praise of the loved ones, especially those saplings that have been nurtured in the shade of mercy, have been raised up, and are sustained by the fresh wine. Such souls should be mentioned by a pure tongue, and a sanctified heart should express love for them. In brief, they are remembered at the point of the heart and enkindled with the warmth of the heart. Praise be to God, they have attained that which has no opposite and is sanctified from peer. Their mention is the key to treasures and their love is the door to victories. All this is from God’s favor, grace and bounty. We beseech Him to gather them beneath His shade, to exalt them through His Name, and cause them to speak His beautiful praise. Peace and remembrance and glory, then honor and exaltation and sublimity be upon your honor and upon those who love you and hear your word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>All praise befitteth the Desired One Who, through the movement of the Most Exalted Pen, hath conquered the peoples of the mortal realm, and through its hidden Kawthar hath bestowed new and wondrous life upon decayed bones. Exalted, exalted be His favor! Exalted be His mercy! Exalted be His greatness and sovereignty! Who can reckon the wondrous tokens of His grace, the sum of His commandments and favors? He it is Who hath made a single word from among His words the standard of guidance from His presence and the banner of His Cause amidst His servants. Through it He hath manifested the Resurrection and its mysteries, the Hour and its signs. Blessed is he who hath recognized that which hath appeared from His presence, and blessed is he who hath witnessed that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of His bounty. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon His loved ones and chosen ones who have hearkened unto His most sweet call and have attained unto the word “Yea, verily” - yea, verily, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of the Kingdom of Names! These are servants who have attained, honored servants, steadfast servants. They are the helpers of God, the hands of His Cause, and the dawning-places of His most beautiful names and attributes. They have taken the choice wine from the hand of His bounty despite His enemies, and have drunk in His name before the faces of His creation. Verily He is the Supporter of His loved ones, the Strengthener of the pillars of His Cause, the Exalter of His loved ones, and the Revealer of their stations and conditions in His kingdom. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The exalted letter with its offerings of utterance and meaning reached this evanescent servant. In truth, each of its words was a chalice filled with the Salsabil of love and affection, adorned as it was with the praise and glorification of the Lord of creation and the Master of all beings. Repeatedly was it read, and with each reading a fresh fragrance was wafted to the nostrils of truth. Glory be to God! Its sweet scents spread wide the carpet of joy, and its perfumes brought a sanctified gladness transcending mortal station. Thereafter, having sought the Most Exalted Paradise and Supreme Heaven, it was presented before the Lord of all humanity and attained the honor of His attention. Then did the ocean of utterance of our Lord, the Most Merciful, surge, and the Speaker of Sinai spoke forth, while seated upon the Throne of Revelation, that whereby the treasures of divine knowledge were revealed in the contingent world before the faces of all religions, and the Herald called out from the direction of the Prison: “Hearken unto the Call of God, raised from the most exalted station.” His blessed and exalted Word is:</p>
<p>He is the Light that shineth and gleameth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! Rejoice that God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, has willed that His Pen should move to make mention of thee. Time and again have We remembered thee and sent thee diverse Tablets wherein every word surged with the ocean of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Compelling, the Knower of the seen and unseen, and from whose horizons shone forth the suns of bounty and grace. Thy Lord chooseth whom He willeth and loveth whom He loveth and remembereth him in such wise as to preserve his name and trace throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. The Wronged One remembereth thee amidst His tribulations as a token of His favor unto thee, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of all being. Neither the oppression of the enemies nor the power of any veiled potentate could hinder Him. While seated upon the throne of justice, the servant who was present brought thy letter and read it before His face. From it We perceived the fragrance of thy submissiveness, humility and devotion to God, the Lord of this praiseworthy station. Blessed is thine ear for having heard God’s call, and thine eye for having beheld His signs, and thy tongue for having voiced His praise amongst His servants. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. I testify that through tribulation He hath upraised His Most Great Name and revealed that which lay hidden in the treasury of His knowledge, the Mighty, the Beloved. We have enjoined upon all trustworthiness, godliness, truthfulness and fidelity. Among the people are those who have cast the command of God behind their backs and committed that which hath caused the faithful ones to lament. They have embraced wickedness and indecency and cast away righteousness and piety, and have uttered such calumnies as no ear in the world hath ever heard the like. He Who speaketh in this Frequented House beareth witness unto this.</p>
<p>Say: O my God, my God! Thou seest Thy sheep amidst the wolves of the earth and Thy trusted ones in the clutches of treachery. I beseech Thee, O Lord, by the ocean of Thy verses and the lights of the dawn of Thy Revelation, and by Thy Call which Thou hast made the Water of Life for all creation, and by Thy Name through which the hearts of all religions were stirred, to adorn Thy servants with the ornament of truthfulness and justice. Enable them to guide those who missed their way when the lights of the Sun of Thy Revelation were manifest, then aid them to return unto the court of Thy pardon and forgiveness and to stand before the gate of Thy bounty and generosity. O Lord! Deliver Thy servants from the oppression of the oppressors and the dominion of the heedless. Then preserve them through the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth and Who hath dominion over all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! Thou hast heard My sweetest call in the eloquent tongue, and We wish to remember thee in the luminous language. This Wronged One hath ever been in the hands of the enemies. They have brought to pass that which none but God can reckon. In these days the wolves of the earth have surrounded Him and are secretly engaged in bringing harm to this Wronged One. Yet God knoweth the treachery of eyes and what the breasts conceal. Whatsoever befalleth in the path of God is beloved. We have joined tribulation to the word of Jacob. Though We are seen in these days without helper or assistant, God shall soon raise up the treasures of His earth and reveal its riches - these are men who shall be raised up for the triumph of the Great News in such wise that no impediment or barrier shall stand in their way. These are the dawning-places of God’s power and the manifestations of His might. No matter shall prevent or veil these shining and resplendent gems. Glory be to God! The people of the Bayan have not yet perceived the fragrance of this Day. They are seen to be more veiled than the followers of the previous Dispensation. Say: […]</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of the heavens, by Thy Lamp which hath desired naught except the reformation of the world and hath taken neither glass, nor crystal, nor any protector save Thee, to illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge and to adorn their heads with the crowns of justice and equity. O my Lord! Thou seest the oppressors united in frustrating Thy Cause and the stations of Thy trusted ones. I beseech Thee by Thy all-encompassing Will and Thy prevailing Purpose to protect them from the evil of those who have violated Thy Covenant and Testament, and have denied Thy most great signs and mighty evidences. There is no God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>Convey to the loved ones of that land the greetings from the Wronged One - greetings whose fragrance will attract the hearts and minds and lead them to the luminous horizon. Counsel all on behalf of the Wronged One to observe trustworthiness, religious devotion, and the fear of God, the Lord of existence and the Educator of the seen and unseen. We have repeatedly stated that in this Most Great Revelation, triumph is achieved through wisdom and utterance, not through sword and spear. Under all conditions, they must occupy themselves with winning hearts and uniting souls. Goodly deeds have ever been and will continue to be the hosts of God, and praiseworthy character the guide of His servants. That which causes the people to shun and avoid is neither acceptable nor adorned with the ornament of His good-pleasure. Although the First Point appeared from the Most Exalted Kingdom in Muharram - which is indeed beloved to the soul and the cause of joy and gladness and the source of delight and happiness - yet most people, due to their lack of awareness, might misconstrue any expression of joy in those days as, God forbid, indicative of hatred and animosity. Therefore, wisdom requires that those days be observed with reverence. Thus did this Wronged One, while in Iraq during the days of Muharram, make mention of His tribulations and attend certain gatherings of lamentation, out of mercy and kindness to the servants. The Exalted One - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - also observed the sanctity of those days. Whatever causes people to draw nigh and leads to their acceptance and attention should be embraced until such time as the Cause becomes manifest to them. Convey this firm decree to the servants that all may become aware and hold fast to that which God hath willed. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who love thee, and who hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the friends of God will arise to triumph the Cause with pure and sanctified hearts and with the aforementioned hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. From the horizon of every Tablet shineth forth the Sun of wisdom and utterance, and all are commanded to follow it. God willing, that beloved one will make the heedless souls aware of the divine commandments and prohibitions. Had the people acted according to God’s will until now, Iran and indeed other countries would have been illumined by the light of His Cause. This evanescent servant ever supplicates: “My God, my God! Assist Thy loved ones to that which will manifest Thy favors upon Thy creation and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty in Thy dominion. O Lord! Purify the hearts of those who have turned to Thee with the Kawthar of Thy utterance, and ordain for them that which will adorn them with the ornament of justice and equity in Thy days. There is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Wise.”</p>
<p>Your esteemed irrefutable treatise was received and accepted. God willing, it will be sent in these days, and permission for its publication has risen from the horizon of utterance. The servant beseecheth his Lord that He may, through your sincerity, humility, acceptance, mention and utterance, open the doors of people’s hearts. Verily, He is the God of mankind and their Educator through His name, the Educator, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of the world’s peoples, Who hath not deprived any seeker from the effulgences of the Luminary of His Word. The new petition of that loved one was received before the countenance of the King of the Kingdom of Utterance and was illumined with the light of acceptance. For each of the names mentioned, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of bounty and sent forth. Praise be to God that that loved one became the means of abundant grace, and likewise became the cause of the descent of the rain of the All-Bountiful’s mercy.</p>
<p>The revelation of verses is of such magnitude that all are powerless to reckon it. From all directions, by night and by day, petitions arrive and gracious replies are given. And if there is sometimes delay, it is for two reasons: first, that through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, your honor dwelleth in the most exalted station, namely that of certitude and assurance, therefore in delay there is no harm; and second, due to the abundance of replies to petitions that have newly been received. Surely that loved one is content and grateful, for he hath repeatedly partaken of heavenly sustenance and true bounties. Well is it with your honor!</p>
<p>On one occasion this supreme utterance was heard from the tongue of the King of the Kingdom of Names regarding your honor. His mighty utterance is: “O servant present! His honor M.H. hath arisen to serve. Verily We have made him the cup-bearer of the Kawthar of God’s utterance, the Lord of the worlds.” Glory be to God! Such is the bounty that the possessors of tongues and pens are unable to describe it. To this testify the leaves of the Paradise of God, the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>If wisdom permitteth and alloweth, convey on behalf of this servant greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land. God is aware that in most times I beseech from the Goal of the world’s peoples that which is immortalized in the Mother Book. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. We are God’s and unto Him shall we return.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise and glory befit His chosen ones, who have ever been and shall forever remain the manifestations of the Divine Will and the embodiments of His All-Merciful Purpose. These are they who have drunk from the chalice of steadfastness and have partaken of the choice wine of God’s love. By the Sun of Truth I swear, with every drop they drink thereof, the denizens of the highest Paradise exclaim “How pleasant!” and the inhabitants of the loftiest Heaven cry out “How delightful!” These are they who are the dawning-places of the effulgent light of God’s Name, the All-Powerful, and the manifestations of His victorious Name, the All-Subduing. Before their might, all worldly power is accounted as the weakest of things, and in the face of their steadfastness, the armies of nations are reckoned among the most abject of servants. They have drunk from the cup of immortality and have detached themselves from all else but God. The colors of the world deceive them not, and its ornaments engage them not. Through their endeavors is raised the tabernacle of glory, and by their service are hoisted the banners of triumph. Glorified be their Creator, their Sustainer, their Helper, their Strengthener, their Guide, and their Inspirer!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose command was revealed that which lay hidden in the treasuries of Thy knowledge and concealed within the repositories of Thy power, and through the breezes of Whose Revelation the dwellers of the graves arose in Thy days. I beseech Thee by the suns of the heavens of Thy bounty and the mysteries enshrined within Thy Book, to aid Thy servants in that which will establish the sanctity of Thy Being and the transcendence of Thine Essence. My God, my God! This servant beareth witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and acknowledgeth that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by the Most Great Name, to forgive Thy servants through Thy grace and bounty, and to assist them with the hosts of Thine invisible realm. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Thou beholdest him who hath been named ’Ali before Akbar, who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause, who hath spoken Thy praise, and who hath desired to spread Thy verses and to exalt Thy Word. I beseech Thee to strengthen him through Thy grace and favors, and to ordain for him the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below.</p>
<p>And furthermore, the letters which that spiritual beloved sent in the name of the beloved of the heart, His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon Him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and likewise to the spiritual beloved, his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, attained the Most Holy Court and were presented before the Countenance of the Object of the world’s desire and were honored to be heard. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger […]</p>
<p>Verily, We were speaking in remembrance and praise of God, pacing in My chambers and pondering upon the Most Great Announcement and what was visited upon it by His enemies who violated His Covenant and Testament, who denied His signs and disputed His proof. Then the servant who was present came with thy letter and presented it before Our face. We hearkened unto it and revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance that which guideth the servants unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! The Wronged One hath appeared and made manifest the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. He hath guided the servants unto the Dayspring of His signs, made known unto them His path, caused them to hear His call, and revealed for them that which draweth them nigh unto His horizon. Among them are those who denied, those who turned away, those who pronounced judgment against Him, and those who cast aside the world in their longing to attain His presence and their ardent love for His verses. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken from the Most Glorious Horizon. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless. Blessed art thou for having hearkened unto the Call and departed from thy home, seeking the Ultimate Goal and the Most Exalted Summit, until thou didst attain His presence, hear and witness. Verily thy Lord loveth His loved ones, maketh mention of them in His Book, and giveth them the glad-tidings of His mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings unto My loved ones who have cast aside all else save Me and have taken what hath been sent down from My presence. These are among the Concourse on High in the Book of God, the Goal of them that know. Say to the Daysprings of idle fancies: Cast aside this day what the people possess, for the Self-Subsisting hath come with manifest sovereignty. Beware lest vain imaginings prevent you from the dawning-places of the Sun of Certitude. Cast aside conjectures and take hold of that which ye have been bidden by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. This is a word - whoso holdeth fast unto it, neither the doubts of the world nor the intimations of the suspicious shall cause him to slip. Blessed is the servant who hath held fast unto it; he is reckoned among the people of certitude in the Book of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>When thou hast drunk from the chalice of My utterance and been seized with the wine of the Kawthar of My knowledge, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to turn unto Thee and to proclaim that which Thou didst command me. I was heedless, but the fragrances of Thy verses and the breezes of the dawn of Thy Manifestation awakened me. I was asleep, but the hands of Thy bounty aroused me. I was ignorant, but Thy gift made me to know. I was seated, but Thy firm Command caused me to arise. O Lord of Eternity! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy mighty Throne and by what was hidden in Thy knowledge, O Goal of them that know, to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. O Lord! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the lights of Thy utterance and adorn their temples with the ornament of resignation and contentment in the kingdom of creation. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The effulgences of the rays of the Most Great Luminary have encompassed the world. That which hath been revealed - its fragrances shall never fade nor perish, and its mention shall endure in the Book of God as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven shall last. Praise be to God! They have drunk that which most of the peoples of the world are deprived of, and have heard that which ears were forbidden to hear, save those whom God hath willed - our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of them that are nigh unto Him. Today the Truth seeketh a helper who would sacrifice himself for the sake of God - that is, who would occupy himself day and night with teaching and with whatsoever may promote the Cause of God, inasmuch as the cawers in every land and region either arrive or emerge therefrom. This is among the tidings that flowed from the Most Exalted Pen during the days when the Most Great Luminary was shining from the horizon of Zawra. At one time the Tongue of Grandeur uttered this most exalted Word - His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>“O servant in attendance! Often it happens that in this land too a cawer is found. Certain souls have loved and do love discord, lying in wait until they find a calf to raise the standard of dissension. The friends of God must be vigilant and remain so steadfast that none shall find occasion for such mentions that cause corruption and are the source of discord.” Thus it ended.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - and imploreth Him to assist His servants and grant them fairness, that all may, with utmost steadfastness and detachment from the world and all that is therein, hold fast unto that which guideth mankind. Assuredly that spiritual friend exerteth mighty efforts in refining souls, purifying hearts, and establishing the steadfastness of the servants. At one time this blessed word was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur - exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O servant in attendance! This land, in its inmost mystery, is not free from corruption.” Thus it ended.</p>
<p>Thus did He Who possesseth the knowledge of all things inform us aforetime and afterward in a perspicuous tablet. This servant conveyeth greetings to all the friends in that land and beseecheth God to assist each one to achieve that which is enduring and everlasting. The world and all that is therein shall perish, save the Divine Word. Blessed is the soul that hath attained thereunto, and likewise the deed that hath appeared for the sake of God. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing Witness.</p>
<p>The sublime, blessed, and holy Tablets which were requested in the letter of his honor Ism-i-Jud and Aqa Mirza Muhammad - upon them be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] - for certain friends, have all, in accordance with that spiritual friend’s request, been revealed from the heaven of divine favor and have been given that they may be dispatched. Among the coincidental events is that some time ago this evanescent servant sent especially for that spiritual friend a letter containing the words of God. After some time it became known that its dispatch was delayed and it was returned again to this ephemeral one. The purpose is that ye have ever been and continue to be remembered.</p>
<p>As to what you have written regarding my brother, that he has not given any funds for his Huquq and that from here a receipt was sent, and this matter has become a cause of hesitation or doubt or, God forbid, a cause of turning away - Glory be to God! These matters pertain to this servant. For whatever names you send, this servant sends receipts. What relation do these matters have to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Sanctuary? Moreover, what has been understood from the words “He doeth what He willeth”? Whatever appears from the True One, glorified be His majesty, is truth in which there is no doubt, as the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, has said: “Should He pronounce the earth to be heaven, or heaven to be earth, He speaketh the truth; and should anyone say ‘Why?’ or ‘Wherefore?’ such a one hath disbelieved in God.” In any case, such matters pertain to this servant, and this servant sends the receipt.</p>
<p>As to what his honor the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, has written regarding this matter - that his honor Ustad, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, has sent two payments and this servant has requested and sent receipts. However, regarding Ustad Kazim, my brother, his honor Ustad has never sent any receipt in his name. Yes, his honor Ustad Kazim Haddad Ardikani, upon him be the Glory of God, had given several payments for which I requested receipts. Two or three receipts arrived and I sent them to the honored Afnan, his honor A. H., upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, to deliver. Since the note did not mention Ustad Kazim Ardikani, his honor the esteemed one thought it was for this Ustad Kazim. As he would profess belief before me and his honor Afnan, while at times associating with the manifestations of Satan, divine tests overtook him in this way. I beseech the Exalted True One not to test this servant, for no soul can emerge from tests except through God’s grace taking his hand.</p>
<p>These matters have been written by his honor the Trustee. Today relationship is cut off, for the relationship with God has come between. Now that spiritual beloved is related to the Truth and to those near and sincere. Beyond the stages of acceptance, devotion and faith, they have been engaged in service for years and have held fast to teaching God’s Cause. Whatever is hidden is manifest before God. Not an atom of deeds has been or will be without reward. I beseech God to confirm that honored one in all conditions, just as He has confirmed him before. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory and praise and laudation be upon you and upon God’s loved ones there who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the cup of the bounty of our Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

<p>?a. O Aqa Mirza Ayyub, upon him be the Glory of God! 15 Jamadiyu’l-Avval 1306.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Today, praise and thanksgiving are the exclusive privilege of His loved ones–those souls who have attained and continue to attain unto the Choice Wine, and who fear not the appointed hour. They have freely sacrificed their lives in the path of Him Who is the Goal of all worlds. Neither the might of princes doth frighten them, nor the oppression of divines cause them to tremble. With most eloquent utterance, they have proclaimed before all religions: “The Truth hath come!” Glory be to God! Wonder upon wonder that the deeds manifested by the lovers in this Revelation have not served to admonish or awaken the peoples of the earth. Whither is fairness fled? What hath become of justice? One, at the moment of martyrdom, exclaimed “How wonderful!” Another declared “I have offered up my spirit unto God!” Yet another, before the House, offered up his life with his own hands. If ye were to count the martyrs of God in this Revelation, ye could not number them. In truth, they are beyond reckoning. Each gave his life in such wise that the denizens of the Supreme Paradise exclaimed “Blessed be God!” and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise cried out “What rapture for the sake of God!” Glorified be the majesty of our Lord! There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O thou beloved of My heart! Thy distinguished letter arrived, bringing into existence the joy that was lost and manifesting the hidden gladness into the realm of being. Praise be to God, it bore tidings of thy well-being, and after causing joy and delight, it was presented before the Presence of the Lord of all worlds at the Most Exalted Court and the Source of the joy of earth and heaven. It was honored to be heard, after which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses. Thus speaketh the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, through My Name, which speaketh before all faces […]</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with a Word from which every people shall find the greatest of what they possess, whereby the people of the Furqan shall discover the fragrances of the All-Merciful, and the people of the Gospel shall find the utterances of the Friend, and the companions of the Torah shall hear the cooing of the Dove of the Cause upon the highest branches, and the people of the Bayan shall find that which attracts the hearts and minds. Thus hath the Mother Book revealed its utterance, and the Mother of Utterance its verses, and the Most Great Ocean its waves, and the Sun of Being its bounty and effulgence. Blessed is the soul that hath ascended, heard and seen. Woe to the heedless! Thou wert present before the Wronged One and didst hear His call and knew that He desired naught save the reformation of the world and the education of the souls of nations. But the people turned away from Him and denied His Manifestation and whatsoever was revealed from Him, out of transgression against God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. By God! This is the Day wherein the Mount hath been moved to smile, for it hath attained unto its Interlocutor, and the Tree calleth out with the most exalted call: “He Who caused Me to speak hath come! Fear God, O people, and deny not Him through Whom the river of utterance hath flowed throughout all possibility and the ocean of knowledge hath surged before all religions.” Be fair in the Cause of God and His Manifestation, and be not of them who disputed His signs and denied His favor and committed that which caused every discerning scholar and every informed mystic to lament.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of men! The Most Great Scene hath been adorned through the Lord of Destiny, and every hidden matter hath been revealed. Turn with radiant faces to the Supreme Horizon and follow not those who have denied the proof of God and His testimony, when He came with a mighty command and clear sovereignty. The servant who was present brought thy letter and presented it before the Face. We have revealed for thee that which was a bounty to the righteous and a light to the chosen ones and a river of life to all peoples. We beseech God to aid them to turn unto Him and to grant them success in that which beseemeth this holy, mighty and wondrous Day. When the attraction of My utterance taketh hold of thee and the wine of My exposition intoxicateth thee, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! My soul is a sacrifice for Thy call, and my spirit for turning to Thee, and for Thy remembrance. Thou hast turned toward me from the direction of the Prison and remembered me when I was silent in Thy remembrance, and called me when I was asleep. I testify that Thy mercy hath preceded me and the light of Thy Cause hath encompassed me. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion, and by the Word whereby the hearts of Thy servants and the realities of Thy creation were attracted, such that they hastened to the place of sacrifice out of longing to meet Thee, and by the neck which attained the rope of enemies in the land of Sad as a manifestation of Thy power and an expression of its detachment from all else but Thee, that Thou aid Thy servants to be fair in Thy Cause, then enable them to rend asunder the veils of idle fancies that prevented them from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory and from hearkening to Thy most sweet call which was raised from Thy Most Exalted Pen. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness and to that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book and manifested for the ascension of Thy creation to the station Thou hast ordained for them through Thy bounty and generosity. O Lord! I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who did not break Thy covenant and Thy testament, and whom neither the might of kings nor the wealth of monarchs prevented from gazing toward Thy horizon and holding fast to Thy cord. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Blessed is God! What a wondrous mention and blessed time, when the call of the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven was raised with the praise of all things! The waves of the ocean of utterance appeared in such wise that the seas of the world became, as it were, all ears to hearken, and likewise the trees. What a rapture hath in this hour seized the world! It is as though the wondrous words have bestowed new spirit and granted fresh life. Each one speaketh with glad tidings and uttereth a word, yet what profit is there, when the people, bereft of justice, are all deprived and forbidden? If they turn aside from this Most Great Cause, what matter is worthy of attachment, and if they deny it, what cause is deserving of acceptance? In any case, prayer is necessary, not cruelty, for strife, contention and corruption have been strictly forbidden in this Most Great Revelation in the Book of our Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Would that they had understood the purpose of the Desired One! He hath commanded all servants in all conditions to patience and forbearance, and the friends have so firmly clung to this blessed word that they are slain but slay not, hear evil but speak it not. These unjust ones of the world have become confident, and each day there occurs that which causeth the eye of justice to weep. The light which is the cause of the world’s illumination - they strive to extinguish it. And these swords and spears, though outwardly directed at these servants, in truth return upon the oppressors themselves. We beseech God to make known to all what they are prevented from recognizing today through idle fancies and vain imaginings. Verily we are God’s and unto Him do we return.</p>
<p>As for thy expression of humility and lowliness before the Most Holy Court, after it was presented, these blessed words were spoken: This humility and lowliness of thine is, before God, exalted be His glory, greater than the might and power of those who possess power. Blessed be thy tongue, for it hath spoken the truth. We beseech God to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to decree for thee that whereby thy mention shall endure in every world of His worlds. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God. After it was presented before the Throne, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for him from the right hand of the Throne. God willing, may he attain unto it and drink from the ocean of the utterance of the Most Merciful that which will intoxicate him such that in the assemblage of the world he may cry out “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign of all realms!” This servant conveyeth greetings and beseecheth God to grant enabling grace. In truth, the mention of the Beloved is a fresh joy for the heart, a new melody for the ear, and a trustworthy fountain for understanding. Praise be to God that that loved one hath attained unto mention, praise, orientation, love and acceptance. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous, and He is the Helper, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Regarding Qurratu’l-’Ayn and the joy of the heart of Luqman, upon him be the glory of the Most Merciful: A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath also been revealed specifically for him from the horizon of the heaven of proof. It is hoped that he may be nurtured under the shadow of the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and attain unto that which is the cause of everlasting life and eternal mention. His mention brought joy, and this is evidence of God’s grace and mercy. The servant beseecheth his Lord to ordain for him what is best for him. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>I convey greetings to the friends in that land, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant each one that which leadeth to exaltation and elevation. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>

<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made known to us His Cause, taught us of His Revelation, guided us to His Path, and unveiled for us that which lay hidden in His knowledge and concealed within the treasuries of His power. He, verily, is the Single One, unto Whose oneness every tongue hath testified, that He is God, and there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been One, Single, Alone, and Self-Subsisting. He hath no peer in creation, no equal in invention, no likeness, no similitude, no partner, no helper, and no offspring. By this doth He shine forth as the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Glory and splendor be upon His loved ones and chosen ones, whom the howling of wolves did not disturb, and who faltered not in their response when the Tongue of Grandeur spoke from its final habitation: “There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Bestower!”</p>
<p>And then, thy letter was received, bringing boundless joy, for it was adorned with the mention of God, exalted be His glory, and His loved ones. This servant beseecheth God to cause all His loved ones in that land to attain His special favors. Blessed are they who have outstripped others in God’s Cause, who have acknowledged and recognized His oneness and singleness, and all that the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered. May He honor others too with eternal life through the breath of accepted souls. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about proceeding to Istanbul and arriving there, it was presented before the Countenance of the Goal of the world’s desire. This is what the Tongue of Utterance spoke in the Kingdom of Knowledge - these are His words, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: “O Sadiq! What thou didst write to the Branches of the Tree was presented before the Face and was seen, and the servant present also submitted thy petition before the Wronged One. God willing, thou shalt in all conditions remain focused on the horizon of the Cause, for the stations of unity, the degrees of remembrance and detachment, the ways of success and prosperity, and the paths of knowledge and salvation have ever led and continue to lead to this station. Nothing can withstand His Cause. Whosoever hath turned towards it must fix his gaze upon the horizon of His Will and act in accordance with that which he hath been commanded, even should all on earth deny it. We convey Our greetings to the friends in that land and give them the glad tidings of divine favors. Blessed is he who hath heard the verses of his Lord and he who hath spoken His praise. Let them hold fast unto wisdom in all matters, lest there appear that which would grieve the hearts and souls.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, mention was made of the friends of that land in the Most Great Scene, and a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for each one. All the world’s riches and adornments cannot equal a single letter thereof. Regarding what thou didst write about entering the great city, had thou acted in accordance with the Command, it would have been more fitting, beneficial and appropriate, for whatsoever proceedeth from God is assuredly in accord with consummate wisdom and closest to what is expedient. Praise be to God that after its presentation, thou wert adorned with the ornament of forgiveness. This is what our Beloved and your Beloved hath spoken, exalted be His utterance: “We have forgiven him. Verily his Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous.” This is a great bounty and a mighty favor that hath shone forth from the horizon of generosity.</p>
<p>As regards what was written concerning Aqa Rida-Quli, upon him be the Glory of God, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to him. God willing, may he be accounted among the servants of God. And concerning his participation every year in the commemoration of His Holiness the Prince of Martyrs, may our souls be a sacrifice for him, this was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold. According to His command, they should continue to act as before. The people are weak and do not understand the cause and reason. Therefore, if it is abandoned, it will cause tumult and confusion. Wisdom requires that they deal with the divines and the descendants of the Prophet with love, as love may guide some to the straight path. Avoidance and distance have been and are the cause of estrangement. In the Most Holy Book He says, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “Consort with the followers of all religions with joy and fragrance. Thus hath the light of Our guidance shone forth from the horizon of wisdom and utterance. Hold ye fast unto it. This is the command which the All-Wise, the Faithful, hath revealed from His Most Great Prison.” For if association is abandoned, who will convey the Word of Truth and who will hear it? However, they must pay the Rights of God, and this servant mentions this out of sincerity, for this practice has been and is the cause of the purification of wealth and the descent of blessing. Since it was asked what they should do, this servant mentioned the Command of God that was revealed in the Book, otherwise for many years most commands and ordinances were sent to various regions except this matter which remained concealed until God decreed it and revealed it through His grace as a bounty to His servants.</p>
<p>And concerning what was mentioned about Mulla Muhammad-i-Shirvani, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold, and this is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the will of our All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>Verily We have heard thy call and have answered thee with a Tablet from whose horizon shineth the light of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. This is a Day wherein everyone possessed of vision hath attained unto the Most Exalted Horizon, and everyone possessed of hearing unto His sweetest call, and every tongue unto His wise remembrance. Blessed is he who hath turned unto the Dayspring of grace and was among them that believe in the unity of God. The Wronged One hath desired naught from anyone. He hath summoned the people by night and by day unto that which God, the Mighty, the Wise, hath commanded. He calleth them unto righteousness and unto that which will draw them nigh unto the All-Informed One. Rejoice thou in that thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One and in that which hath been revealed for thee, whereby thy remembrance shall endure as long as God’s most beautiful names endure. Be thou thankful for this great bounty.</p>
<p>God willing, may they be adorned with the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful and with the ornament of steadfastness, and may they speak in praise and glorification of God, exalted be His Glory. According to His command, that spiritual friend should act with utmost wisdom. To everyone who is steadfast and firm, they should convey that which is the cause of sanctification, detachment, love and knowledge of God, exalted be His Glory. In the Hidden Words He says, exalted and glorified be His Word: “The wise are they that speak not unless they obtain a hearing.” No one is permitted to approach anyone without permission. Make this command known to all, for proceeding without permission can often lead to troubles. The excellence of deeds depends upon God’s good-pleasure. Blessed is he who acteth according to that which hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>With regard to the six firm, assured and steadfast souls - Mr.&nbsp;Ali Akbar, Karbala’i Aqa Kish, Aqa Rida-Quli, Aqa Asghar, Aqa Mirza Abdul-Karim and Karbala’i Qasim, may the glory of God rest upon them - you mentioned that they have intended to undertake pilgrimage. This matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence and was met with approval. God willing, may they be assisted to perform good deeds and manifest praiseworthy conduct. They must give thanks to the Exalted Truth that they have been blessed with this supreme bounty. His is the glory and the generosity, His is the grace and the grandeur, His is the command and the judgment. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and salutations to them and to all the other friends of God in that land who are enkindled with the fire of love and illumined by the light of recognition. He beseecheth from the Exalted Truth confirmation and assistance for all. Verily He is the Bestower, the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of the bounty of our Lord and your Lord be upon you and upon them and upon those who have quaffed the wine of certitude from the hands of the generosity of our Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. And praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>In My Name, the Manifest, the Speaking, the Trustworthy […]</p>
<p>O servant of God! Rejoice in that the face of the Wronged One hath turned towards thee from this place which hath been named the Most Great Prison by the Lord of eternity. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Hearing, the One Who answereth prayer. We have detected from thee the fragrance of My love, and We have turned unto thee from this remote spot and revealed unto thee that from which thou canst inhale the sweet-scented perfume of My luminous robe. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away vain desire and laid hold on righteousness. He is of the people of My crimson Ark, the mention of which was revealed in the Qayyumu’l-Asma, and which was announced by My Herald Who sacrificed His life for My sake, and proclaimed unto the people My manifestation, My advent, My dawning, My arising, and My Cause, firm and mighty. Blessed is the ear that hath heard the call of the Wronged One and the eye that hath beheld that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of his Lord, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. O servant of God! The servant who was present brought thy letter and presented it before My face while the Wronged One was walking in this exalted spot. We heard it and have answered thee with that which diffuseth the fragrance of God’s bounty, the Lord of all worlds. We send greetings from this spot unto thee and unto My loved ones who have cast away what the people possess, yearning for that which is with their Lord, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. We counsel them to fear God and to do that which exalteth His great Cause. Say: O people of Baha, should anyone come unto you with the tablets of fire and the book of the wicked, cast them behind you and hold fast unto the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Rejoice, O My loved ones! By God, through you the clouds pour down their bounty and the earth yieldeth its blessings and favors. Thus doth the clear Book that is with Him give you glad-tidings. Beware lest the conditions of men debar you from the Lord of creation, or the might of those in the land who have cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed every wicked transgressor cause you to fear. Hold fast unto goodly conduct in all conditions and cleave unto the hem of wisdom - a command from the One Who is All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Upon you be praiseworthy character and goodly deeds. These are God’s hosts on earth, as attesteth every discerning and insightful one. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones! Blessed be your faces and your ears. Ye have attained unto that which was the purpose in God’s Books of the past and of the future. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Expositor, the Mighty, the Trusted One.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The waves of the ocean of divine bounty have encompassed the friends. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that all the world cannot equal a single verse thereof. Today, all who dwell on earth are heedless and know not the fruits, mysteries and traces of the mention of God, exalted be His glory. For were the fruits of but one letter thereof to be cast upon those on earth, by God Himself the Truth, all would turn, detached from all else, to the most exalted horizon. O friend! The intoxication of heedlessness has seized all and deprived them of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful, save whom thy Lord willeth. How blessed is the one whose mention hath been made in the Most Holy Court. The Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, hath said that all existence is for the purpose that one might be mentioned but once in His presence. Likewise, in exalting the Divine Word, these sublime utterances have issued forth from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful’s expression - His word, exalted be His remembrance: “If one were to transcribe a single verse thereof, it would be better than transcribing the entire Bayan and all books written therein, for all shall pass away while that shall endure.” Were one to reflect upon this utterance, the condition of those who have turned away from among the people of the Bayan and others, as well as the loftiness and sublimity of this Most Great Cause, would become evident and manifest. Blessed are the fair-minded! Blessed are they who know! Blessed is every learned one who hath attained unto this most exalted station and been adorned with the ornament of this Most Great Announcement!</p>
<p>I convey greetings and salutations to all the friends in that land and say: Today is the day of mention and praise, and the day of deeds for God’s sake. May you be assisted, God willing, in that which endureth and lasteth forever. Although through divine grace you have been enabled to make mention of God–exalted be His station and His grandeur–this is a station that description cannot encompass nor can the praise of all created things attain unto it. God willing, may this station be preserved through the name of the Lord of all mankind, for the Supreme Pen hath previously given tidings of the tablets of fire and the book of Sijjin and the croaking of the ravens and the schemes of the schemers. May God protect us and you from the schemes of every schemer and the deceit of every deceiver and the evil of every accursed satan.</p>
<p>I convey greetings and salutations to the honored friend, his eminence Aqa Mirza Ahmad, upon him be the glory of God and His favors. May he be, God willing, the recipient of the infinite bounties of God, exalted be His glory, occupied with His remembrance and engaged in His service. From the heaven of divine Will there hath been sent down especially for him, and likewise for each of the names mentioned in his book, that which brighteneth and illumineth the eyes of those near unto God and the sincere ones. In truth, any person of insight and hearing who readeth a single verse of the divine verses and findeth its sweetness will observe himself to be detached and sanctified from all who dwell on earth and whatsoever they possess. Praise be to God that he hath attained unto perfect bounty and hath likewise become the cause of bounties. Blessed be he and they. The ocean of grace is so tempestuous that every fair-minded one is bewildered. There is no God but Him, the Revealer, the Manifester, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Generous. And beyond that which hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty especially for him in this leaf, another Tablet hath also been revealed from the heaven of grace, from every word of which shineth forth the Sun of the favors of the Sovereign of existence […]</p>
<p>And from the horizon of each word thereof, the Sun of the favors of the Sovereign of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen doth shine forth and appear. Blessed are they who have attained unto Tablets that cannot be equaled by whatsoever existeth in the world. The Glory that is manifest and resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of the grace of our Lord and your Lord be upon you and upon those who have been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen of God in His perspicuous Book. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station in grandeur and power!</p>
<p>Praise be to the Lord of all desire, Who hath adorned cities and lands with the lights of the Sun of Truth and the radiance of recognition, and hath confirmed pure and holy ears to hearken unto the Call. Whoso attaineth unto true hearing attaineth unto steadfastness. The purpose of hearing hath ever been true hearing, as witnessed aforetime when they heard yet turned away, and hear yet object. Blessing and peace be upon His Beloved and Chosen One, Whom He chose for the manifestation of His Cause and the promulgation of His laws and ordinances, and upon His family and companions, through whom God’s proof was perfected unto His creation and His might was made manifest among His servants.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your remembrance and your steadfastness! The blessed letter arrived and was indeed the bearer of glad tidings, for it conveyed news of your good health and well-being, and likewise was an informed herald of the degrees and stations of detachment, severance, adherence and devotion - a knower who was knowing, and a pure one who was eloquent and able. After its perusal and review, it was taken to the Sacred Presence and presented. He said: “We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him in that which is befitting, to open before his face the gates of blessing and bounty, and to manifest through him that which will guide people to His path and adorn them with the ornament of trustworthiness and chastity. Verily, He is powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>We make mention of an Afnan from among the faithful who is named Siyyid Aqa, and We give glad tidings unto him who is named Muhammad-Rida. We beseech God, exalted be He, to inscribe for them from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall never be exhausted and shall endure as long as His most beautiful names and most exalted attributes endure. We make mention of Our loved ones there and beseech for them blessing and well-being from God, the Lord of all creation, and We say: “My God, my God! Make the end of their affairs to be good.” End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant hath ever besought from God, exalted be His glory, for each of the Afnan that which is the cause of the greatest bounty for all peoples. Verily, He is the Lord of the world and the Guide of His servants to His Most Ancient and Most Noble Name. Likewise, he hath besought for the loved ones, upon them be God’s peace, whatsoever is worthy of His generosity. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual beloved, Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and likewise of the spiritual beloved Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Karim and the loved ones of that land, namely ’Ishqabad. After presentation, He spoke words that were as the spring rains of bounty for the saplings of existence, and as the breeze of generosity for receptive souls both seen and unseen. Previously, two pages of utterances, from each word of which wafted the fragrance of grace, mercy and bounty, were sent to that land through the honored Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. And secondly, when that eminent one intended mention, the command was given to send a telegram. The servant beseecheth his Lord to confirm all in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to aid them in that which will elevate their stations among the parties. Verily, He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Commanding, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As regards Mr.&nbsp;Mulla Muhammad-’Ali (Tafti), upon him be the Glory of God [Baha’u’llah], after presentation They stated that upon his arrival in prison he sent whatever he had, and permission was given to accept it, but until now We have not used it. And now, considering that he has again intended to send an amount, We will accept this sum provided that he also accepts this second amount from Us. This is a bounty from Us. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to him and give him the glad tidings of boundless favors. The Afnan know and are aware that this Wronged One’s acceptance of the previous sum was purely out of love for them. Until now We have not accepted from most, but from him it was accepted the first time that it may reach Us a second time. We beseech God to open before his face the gates of His grace, His bounty and His blessing, and to make him among those who have attained to His mention in His lands and to the assistance of His Cause among His servants through wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Again, mentioning the loved ones of the land of ’Ayn and Shin, They said: O My loved ones in that place! You are the keys to the gates of steadfastness among creation and the banners of guidance among all beings. Through you the unity of His Being and the sanctity of His Essence are established. We counsel you, O loved ones of God, to wisdom and to that whereby your stations and conditions may be exalted. Blessed are you and blessed is he who loves you purely for the sake of God, the Lord of earth and heaven and the Lord of the mighty throne. Beware lest the clamor of the people who have cast justice behind their backs, clinging to oppression, frighten you. Verily they are in grievous torment. They have no helper nor supporter. Soon will the breezes of chastisement seize them from all directions. Verily He is the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>What is needed is unity and harmony and wisdom and moderation in all matters. Blessed are they who have held fast to the cord of unity and acted in accordance with what they were commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</p>
<p>As regards separation - it is in no wise permissible. Separation in that land causes the fire of hatred to be kindled. In all the lands of Iran, as that land belongs to another government, the means of freedom are obtained. However, this freedom becomes the cause of bondage for other friends in the lands of Iran. In any case, in all circumstances one must hold fast to moderation and to means that cause the attraction and drawing near of hearts, and this matter depends upon goodly deeds and praiseworthy character which are the cause of guidance and the drawing near of souls. Verily He is with you, witnessing and seeing, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr.&nbsp;Mir Muhammad-Husayn Beg, upon him be the Glory of God, and certain petitions from those parts which you wrote about - some time ago there was specifically revealed for him that which is an enduring proof for the world and its people, and it was sent. The servant beseeches his Lord that He may cause eyes to be gladdened by beholding it and ears by hearing it. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Wise. My beloved Mir and the loved ones of those parts, both men and women, have ever been and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Their station is evident and clear from the divine Tablets. Blessed are they. Your honor should write replies to their letters and express the bounties from before the True One.</p>
<p>Regarding the exalted matters you wrote about - in all conditions We beseech and implore the True One for the exaltation of His Cause in the cities and regions and for the victory of the honored Afnan. Verily He is the Answerer of prayers.</p>
<p>Regarding the Qur’an, it should be obtained from Aqa Husayn-’Ali, or a credible document bearing the seal of several people should be prepared with all details mentioned therein, and sent to His Holiness Haji Mirza Hasan (upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]) in the Land of ?a. This matter is most important, for much has been said and many calumnies have been attributed. However, they should request this from Aqa Husayn-’Ali in a spirit of friendship, and they should not enter into confrontation with anyone. Love and kindness for the sake of God is required towards every soul, except those who turn away–this commandment hath been sent down from the heaven of the divine decree in the Most Holy Book. Well is it with them that act accordingly. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you and hearken unto your words.</p>

<p>In the Name of God! To his honor Haji Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, upon whom rest the peace of God. 1 Rajab 1307.</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His glory, His grandeur and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath uttered a Word from among His supreme Words whereby He hath distinguished between the servants in the world of creation, and through it hath manifested His sovereignty and revealed His power, and through it the oceans of meanings and utterance have surged in the realm of possibility, and the Most Great Book hath spoken forth among the peoples: “O concourse of earth and heaven! By God, He Who is the Dawning-Place of certitude hath come, and with Him the Criterion whereby truth hath been separated from error. At this all the tribes have trembled save whom God, the Lord of the worlds and the Goal of the mystics, hath willed.”</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord and my Support! I beseech Thee by Thy resplendent and manifest Light, by Thy firm Cord, and by Thy revelations on the Day of Judgment, to illumine the hearts of Thy loved ones with the light of Thy knowledge, then grant them the Kawthar of steadfastness from the hands of Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou hast created them to exalt Thy Cause and manifest Thy Word. Thou beholdest them detached from all else save Thee and hastening to the shore of the ocean of Thy oneness, having cast aside the idle fancies and vain imaginings whereby Thy servants were prevented from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy grandeur. Ordain for them, O Thou Goal of the world, that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is none other God but Thee, the Master of the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O my beloved, the heart of this evanescent one soared when he heard the cooing of the nightingale of thy praise in describing God, our Lord and thy Lord, our Goal and thy Goal, and the reins of tranquility were taken from my hands such that I proclaimed before all faces: “Sovereignty belongeth unto Him Who hath, throughout all ages and centuries, drawn His servants unto Himself through His call.” By God’s glory and grandeur, joy hath taken hold of me from all directions in that thy honor hath rent asunder the veils that prevented the servants from turning to the supreme horizon and the most exalted summit. It is as though I heard from the traces of thy pen the verses of thy attraction, thy burning, and thy longing for God, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Loving. When I read and became acquainted therewith, I approached the Presence and presented it before His Countenance. The Master - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - said: “O Abu’l-Qasim! Upon thee be the peace of God and His loving-kindness. The servant present hath appeared before the Face and presented thy letter. We found therein the fragrance of thy love, thy turning unto God, thy sincerity, thy certitude, thy steadfastness, and thy humility before God, the Lord of the visible and invisible, and the Lord of the mighty throne. By My life! Were anyone to hearken with the ear of his true nature, he would hear from the very rock: ‘The kingdom, the dominion, the glory and the power belong unto God, the Lord of the worlds.’ Blessed is thine ear for having heard the Call, and thine eye for having beheld the supreme horizon, and thy standing before the Seat of Justice, and thy mention and praise on a day wherein the idolaters have encompassed the cities of God, the Master of what was and what shall be.”</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of the love of God! It behooveth thee and the unitarians to cling to the hem of the robe of God’s loving-kindness and to beseech from the heaven of His grace and the ocean of His bounty that He protect them from the evil of the idolaters and change their weakness into strength and their powerlessness into might. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all names. There is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. When thou hearest the call of the Wronged One, turn thy face toward the Kaaba of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and say […]</p>
<p>Praised be Thou, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy straight path, and given me the glad-tidings of Thy mighty announcement, and illumined my heart with the light of Thy oneness, and caused my tongue to speak of that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Books, Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. Glorified art Thou, O Sender of the winds and Cleaver of the dawn! I beseech Thee by Thy Lamp which hath been assailed by the tempests of the tyrannical among Thy servants and the storms of the oppressors throughout the lands, to assist whosoever hath acknowledged Thy oneness and confessed to that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Books. O Lord! Thou hearest my yearning in Thy love, and my longing and passion aroused by the breezes of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee to aid me in giving the glad-tidings to Thy servants of the appearance of Thy signs and the manifestation of Thy evidences. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This servant is amazed at how the grace, favor, justice and bounty of God, exalted be His glory, has influenced and continues to influence the world of being. The requirements of wisdom confirmed His presence in a station from which all have turned away, and enabled the hearing of utterances from which all are debarred and deprived, save those whom His prevailing Will and triumphant Purpose have chosen. Indeed the world has been made new. The mysteries of utterance have, by the will of the Desired One of the worlds, emerged from the unseen into the visible realm, and from concealment into manifestation. Since these favors have outwardly appeared and been unveiled for that exalted one, it is hoped that he may become the leader of God’s hosts, namely righteousness and piety. Praiseworthy character is regarded as the mightiest of hosts before the Lord of eternity. God willing, may they with these hosts conquer the cities of wisdom and utterance, and illumine the world with the light of knowledge. This matter hath never been difficult in God’s sight. With one word He attracted the pure gem of justice and exalted it above the heavens. He is the One Who doeth what He willeth by His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>From your determination, assurance is gained that you will summon a number of the heedless to the horizon of wisdom and cause them to attain that which will make the tongues of all realities proclaim the blessed words “The Kingdom is God’s.” All the friends in that land have been and are remembered before their Lord, and this servant hath besought for each one blessings that are beyond reckoning and limitation.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the mention that would cause the awareness of the servants - this is not permitted in those lands according to the Command, for most of the people do not distinguish between the mischief-maker and the reformer. Rather, they have regarded and continue to regard the reformer as the mischief-maker and the mischief-maker as the reformer. The pillars of justice have been weakened, and likewise justice. This servant and you must beseech God to adorn His servants with the ornament of fairness. That which is the cause of joy and the source of gladness is that you were not deprived of the ocean of favor and partook of that which shall endure forever and shall always be remembered. May the unseen reinforcement render its assistance manifest, for the movement and intention have been and are for the sake of God. The servant beseecheth his Lord to draw you near, to fulfill your needs, and to assist you in His remembrance and praise through wisdom and utterance. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful, the Helper.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of Haji Mirza Abu-Talib - may God strengthen him - since it occurred before awareness of the Cause that hath appeared, there was and is no harm in it. I beseech God to ordain for him what He hath ordained for His trusted ones and chosen ones. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. It is hoped that henceforth he may be remembered before his Lord and not remain deprived of the Most Great Ocean.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the blessed Book of Iqan, God willing, all of it will reach your honor. Those who circle round about all send their greetings and beseech God, exalted be His glory, for your confirmation. Peace, remembrance and praise be upon your honor and upon the righteous servants of God. May He bestow upon all a portion from the effulgences of the Orb of divine favor - a portion that is enduring and everlasting. Similarly, all other items were received. This is quite clear and evident: that any matter which is blended with love is reckoned among the great bounties in the sight of God. I convey greetings to all the loved ones in that land, and I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on behalf of each one, for that which its fragrance shall never cease to waft from the cities of the sincere and detached ones. Verily He has power over all things. His honor Aqa Mirza Kazim, upon him be the peace of God - during the previous occasion, at the time of the arrival of your letter, permission was granted. It is hoped that he will attain to that which he desires. Peace, remembrance and glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who have attained unto the Word of God and His love and who have acted according to that which they were commanded in His mighty and impregnable Book. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the All-Glorious</p>
<p>God testifieth in the midmost heart of eternity that there is none other God but Him, the Self-Subsisting, the Gracious, the Sublime, the Omnipotent, and He calleth to witness at the Throne of the Mystic Tabernacle that there is none other God but Him, the All-powerful, the Exalted, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>God testifieth in the exalted Dominion of Majesty: “I am God, and there is none other God but Me, the All-Glorious, the Inaccessible, the Wondrous.” He calleth to witness in the Kingdom of Grandeur: “I am God, and there is no God but Me, the Transcendent, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Peerless.”</p>
<p>God testifieth on the throne of all existence, that there is none other God but Him, and that the Primal Point is His Servant and His Glory.</p>
<p>The days of the Servant have come to pass and He hath ascended to the throne of the Most High, wherefore Baha shone from the horizon of eternity once more with a sovereignty exalted above all creation, and all the kings and the rulers bowed their heads before the splendor of His dominion.</p>
<p>The veils of vain imaginings were cleft, the mantles of concealment were rent asunder and the standards of glory were raised betwixt the heavens and the earth, and God came on the heavenly clouds with hosts of glory, on His left the angels of Revelation and on His right the concourse of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>He rose in the midst of heaven and earth and called unto all created beings with such ascendency that caused the hearts of the denizens of Paradise to tremble and the foundations of all things to quiver, and this is verily that which was sent down upon His well-favored servants as a token of His absolute loving kindness and spoken through his most eloquent, most wondrous, most articulate, and most beauteous tongue.</p>
<p>O ye people of the earth! We have created ye through our behest and have made known unto ye Our Self, the True One, through the Manifestation of My own Self, the Exalted, the Great. We raised Him by the power of truth and endowed Him with Our sovereignty and sent Him to you with a Manifest Book. He came to you from the dawning place of Revelation with signs which attracted the hearts of every fair-minded and knowledgeable soul and every person of high station, but, ye have repudiated Him and denied that which was revealed unto Him of the verses of thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the Most Compassionate. A few souls amongst you believed in Him-them who had crushed the idols of vain imaginings with My exalted power, and abandoned the bastion of blind imitation and perversity in My Name, the All-Powerful, the All-Subduing, the Almighty. No sooner have ye believed in Me and acknowledged My sovereignty and recognized My book, than We admonished you in all Our Tablets not to act as the infidels amongst our heedless servants had done. And We revealed not the Bayan but to announce unto you Our appearance in the kingdom of all creation. And when the Lord of Divine Decree manifested Himself once again and appeared on the clouds of Divine behest, you denied Him and rejected that which you had believed in, and turned away from that which you had turned unto, and wert of the infidels.</p>
<p>O ye people of the Bayan! By the righteousness of God, this is My beauty with which I pride Myself in My realm, and the denizens of My celestial kingdom seek blessings from My presence. Nay, rather, all else move by His Will, He verily is powerful over all that He willeth and He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful. He appeared amongst you with such power that astonished them that devoutly worship Him. He rose alone before all that dwell in the heavens and on earth with the power bestowed by Us and I, verily, am the Almighty, the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>Thus calleth the tongue of the Merciful One the people of the Bayan, that perchance they may shake off their slumber and be of them that are attuned to that which God hath counseled them in all the Tablets, and be of them who reflect, and that they may vacillate not in the Cause in which whomsoever hesitateth all his work will come to naught, even if he cometh forth with all pious worship of the former and latter generations. They had hesitated in His Cause, rejected His appearance, gainsaid His signs, and denied that which He did bring to them as bidden by the Omniscient, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Arise then for the service of thy Lord, and aid Him Who hath sought no support for Himself but God; this is His bounty upon you, He, verily can afford to dispense with all creatures. Say: O people! This is the heavenly Youth amongst you and He hath come to you with Divine Sovereignty and Power and reciteth unto you at all times that which is beyond the power and comprehension of the whole creation. He did succor you whilst you wert destitute on earth until the standards of victory were hoisted upon every lofty and indomitable mountain.</p>
<p>O thou Nabil! Know, verily, that among the froword are those who claim that these verses were not revealed according to true faith. Say: woe betide you and that which flows from your tongues. By God! The true faith of God, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Subduing, hath appeared through these verses. And there are those who say that this Youth hath slandered God and thus hath repudiated the signs of God and hath denied His proofs and is counted among them who perceived not. They repeat that which the people of the Quran said when Ali came with the truth and they returned to their original seat of denial. By the righteousness of God! I heard from these people that which the ears of creation had not heard. Thus did the Eyes of Grandeur cry behind His most holy and exalted veil. Say: O people! I believe in the scriptures of God and the tablets of His Cause amongst you, and I was commanded to believe not but in Him and to recite unto you that which the Spirit speaketh in my heart. By God, this is from Myself, rather at the bidding of God, the All-Compelling, the Almighty, the All-Wise. And if this is My crime, then with which proof have ye believed in the prophets of God in the past? Produce it if ye are amongst them who speak the truth. That which befell Me at the hands of these people had not befallen anyone in the whole of creation. To this bear witness the tongues of the worlds. O Thou the Pen of the Most High! Proclaim Thou unto Nabil the mysteries of God’s irrevocable Decree that perchance he may drink of this soft flowing river of immortality that runs on the right side of His Throne, and that he may become cognizant of that which is hidden from the eyes of the heedless. Haply he may pursue steadfastly the path of this Cause which no man hath the strength to withstand except him who fixeth his gaze onto the Most Sublime Vision, and is sanctified from the uncertainties of this ephemeral realm at this time in which all are veiled from beholding the beauty of the All-Merciful but for them whom thy Lord, the Sovereign, the All-Wise, ordaineth.</p>
<p>Say: Nabil-i-Akbar who ascended unto God had hesitated in the Cause of this Youth, hence was not granted admission to visit the city and his breath of life was extinguished by virtue of God’s sovereign power as bidden by the Almighty, the Most Powerful. He reached not the shores of God’s nearness and acquired no sustenance from the earthly riches he amassed, and returned to dust with great remorse. And yet, none other soul was awakened and those who claimed to believe perceived not and were in manifest error. We disclosed not his doings and concealed them in layers of veil, but now have revealed them unto thee so that thou may be steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. In spite of this, God pardoned him and forgave his misdeeds. There is no Lord but Him, His are the kingdoms of Revelation and creation, He ordaineth as He wisheth and doeth as He pleaseth. Thus have We informed thee and recounted unto thee choices from many tales so that thou may find the sweet fragrances of thy Lord from these resistless, all-compelling and mighty words. Know then that we isolated Our Self and departed from amongst Our companions and We remained at home alone relying on God, My Lord and thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Ponder then this; perchance God may open thy eyes that thou may perceive that which the eyes of the onlookers have failed to discern. Joy, grandeur and glory rest upon thee and upon every discerning man of insight.</p>
<p>He is the Most Wondrous, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>God beareth witness in the Pole of Eternity that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Powerful. And I bear witness in the Throne of the Heaven of Mystery that there is none other God but Him, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God beareth witness in the Dominion of Glory that I, verily, am God, there is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the Inaccessible, the Wondrous. And I bear witness in the Kingdom of Grandeur that I, verily, am God, there is none other God but Me, the Most High, the Sovereign, the Peerless, the Single. God beareth witness upon the thrones of all else besides Him that there is none other God but Him and that the Primal Point is His servant and His Glory. The days of servitude have ended and He hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Companion. Thereupon did the Glory shine forth from the horizon of eternity once again with such sovereignty as caused the necks of kings and rulers to bow before the radiance of His dominion. The veils of fancy have been rent asunder, and the curtains of concealment have been split, and the banners of majesty have appeared between the heavens and the earth. God hath come upon clouds of holiness with hosts of glory, with angels of His Cause on His right and the company of those near unto Him on His left. He hath stood with His sovereignty in the midst of heaven and earth and hath called out to all created things with such might as hath caused the hearts of the dwellers of Paradise to tremble and the pillars of all things to quake. This is what hath been sent down through pure grace unto His near-serving servants, and He hath spoken with His most eloquent, most wondrous, most expressive and sweetest tongue.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! We have created you through a command from Us and have made known unto you Our true Self through this Most Exalted and Most Great Manifestation of Mine. We have raised Him up in truth and distinguished Him with authority from Our presence and sent Him unto you with a perspicuous Book. He came to you from the Dayspring of the Cause with verses that drew unto them the hearts of every fair-minded one possessed of knowledge and every one of high rank. Yet you denied Him and what was sent down unto Him of the verses of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And there believed in Him but a few souls from among you who shattered the idols of vain desire through My supreme authority and emerged from the fortress of blind imitation through My Name, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>When you believed in My Self and acknowledged My sovereignty and recognized My Book, We counseled you in all the Tablets not to do as did the idolaters from among Our heedless servants. Verily, We sent down the Bayan for no other purpose except to inform you of My Revelation in the dominions of the worlds. Yet when the Sovereign of Destiny appeared once again upon the clouds of decree, you denied Him and were among the deniers. You rejected what you had recognized, and turned away from that which you had accepted, and were among the idolaters.</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! By God, this is My Beauty through which I take pride in My dominion, and by Whose presence the dwellers of My kingdom seek blessing. Nay, all else moveth by His command, and verily He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth, and verily He is the Mighty, the Bountiful. He hath appeared among you with such power as hath bewildered the souls of the holy ones, and He hath arisen by His own self against all who are in the heavens and on earth with a power from Us, and I am the Mighty, the Glorious. Thus did the tongue of the All-Merciful call out to the people of the Bayan, that perchance they might become aware within themselves and be mindful of that wherewith God counseled them in all the Tablets, and be among those who remember. They shall not hesitate regarding a matter wherein hesitation would cause their deeds to be rendered vain, even should they perform the worship of the first and the last ones. Yet they hesitated in His Cause, turned away from meeting Him, denied His verses, and rejected what He brought from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Informed. And thou, arise to serve God, then aid Him Who hath taken no helper for Himself other than Him. This is from His grace unto thee, and verily He is independent of the help of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is the Servant of God among you, and He hath come to you with His sovereignty and His power, and He reciteth unto you at every moment that which all created things are powerless to produce. And He aided you at a time when you were weak in the earth, until the banners of victory were raised upon every lofty and impregnable mountain.</p>
<p>O Nabil! Know that among the deniers are those who say these verses were not revealed through divine inspiration. Say: Woe to you and to what issues from your mouths! By God, through these verses hath appeared the nature created by God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. And among them are those who say this is a fabrication against God, and thereby disbelieve in God’s verses and deny His proof, being among the unperceiving. They say as said the leaders of the Furqan when ’Ali came with the truth, and they returned to their original station, the seat of the idolaters. By God, I have heard from these what no ear among contingent beings hath heard, whereat the eyes of grandeur wept behind sacred and impenetrable veils. Say: O people! I believe in what ye possess of God’s scriptures and tablets of His Cause, and am commanded to worship none but Him, and to recite unto you what the Spirit uttereth in my breast. By God, this is not of mine own accord, but from God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. If this be my crime, by what proof did ye believe in God’s Messengers of old? Produce it, if ye be truthful. There hath befallen Me from these what hath befallen no one in creation, to which the tongues of the world do testify.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Remind Nabil of the mysteries of divine decree, that perchance he may drink from this Salsabil that floweth from the right hand of the Throne, and become aware of that which is hidden from the eyes of the heedless, that he may stand firm in this Cause whereon none can stand save he who gazeth with the Most Great Vision and is purified from the doubts of the age in these days wherein all are veiled from the Beauty of the All-Merciful save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the All-Wise. Say: Verily, Nabil-i-Akbar who ascended unto God, when he hesitated in the Cause of the Youth, was thereby deprived of visiting the City, and his soul was taken by the power of might from One mighty and omnipotent. He reached not the shore of nearness and was not blessed with the earthly treasures that were gathered, returning to dust with great remorse. Yet none took heed, nor did those who claim faith within themselves become aware, being in manifest heedlessness. We concealed this and veiled it behind the veils of concealment, but now We reveal it unto thee that thou mayest be among those firm in thy Lord’s Cause. However, God forgave him and expiated his misdeeds, for there is no judge but Him. His is the command and creation; He ordaineth what He willeth and doeth what He pleaseth. Thus have We informed thee and related unto thee of every tale that thou mayest find thy Lord’s fragrances from these firm, decisive, and straight words.</p>
<p>Then know that We secluded Ourself and departed from among those who were with Us, and sat alone in the house, relying upon God, my Lord and thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Ponder thou upon this, that God may open thine eyes and thou mayest witness what the eyes of the beholders were powerless to perceive. Spirit, glory and splendor be upon thee and upon every discerning and insightful one.</p>
<p>He is God.</p>
<p>A missive requested previously by one of the friends was sent, and a tablet in Persian was revealed for that soul, but it was not sent now, until later as circumstances may require.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth and made them a proof from Him unto all the worlds, and through them hath caused to descend from the heaven of His command that which draweth men nigh unto the knowledge of His Self, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Powerful. And therein hath God testified of Himself by His Self that there is none other God but Him and that He is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He hath created all things out of nothing by His Will, and brought forth all beings out of non-existence by His Word. Blessed, then, be God, the Best of creators!</p>
<p>He hath sent unto them in every age a Messenger to guide them to the court of sublime glory and to draw them nigh unto God and to detach them from all else save Him - a mercy from His presence, for He, verily, is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Among the people were those who believed, and among them were those who turned away and disbelieved, and were among the arrogant ones, until the days culminated in the Day whereon the Sun of Eternity shone forth from the horizon of holy splendor, accompanied by clear proofs, manifest evidences, and consummate wisdom, which all creation proved powerless to comprehend. Most of the servants disbelieved in Him and rose up against Him in opposition until they slew Him unjustly. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! And by this did the Temples of Names weep in the crimson chambers and the Daysprings of Attributes in the white pavilions, and the hearts of them that are nigh unto God were consumed. Thus did every nation deal with their Messenger, disputing with Him vainly to conceal the beauty of God behind the veils of self and passion. But God destroyed them by His power and made His Cause to triumph through His sovereignty. Verily, there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>And thou, O servant, know that mention of thy name hath been made before Us. When We found in thy heart the love of God and the Manifestation of His Self, We caused to descend from the clouds of grace verses of holy grandeur and sent them unto thee, that thou mightest inhale therefrom the fragrance of Paradise and be of them that are secure. When this reacheth thee, arise from thy place, then place God’s tablet and trace upon thy head and say:</p>
<p>O my God, my Lord and my Beloved! I have turned my face toward Thee and held fast to the cord of Thy grace and favor, and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy loving-kindness and bounty. Therefore, O my God, disappoint me not of that which lieth with Thee, then send down upon me that which shall detach me from all else save Thee and remind me of the wonders of Thy remembrance at every morn and eve. O Lord! Deprive me not of the breezes of Thy merciful loving-kindness, nor cause me to despair of the dawning splendors of the lights of Thy grace and favors. O Lord! I am the poor one who hath arrived at the shore of Thy riches, and I am the lowly one who hath been stirred in the atmosphere of Thy glory and power. Take my hand with the hand of Thy power and deliver me from the depths of self and passion, and free me from that which preventeth me from soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and knowledge. Verily, Thou hast power over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thus have We commanded and taught thee. Act thou according to what thou hast been bidden and be of the thankful. We beseech God to aid thee in His Cause and to establish thee in His love, for verily He is the Protector of them that do good. Know thou that the world and all that is therein shall pass away, and that which shall endure is what hath been ordained for thee in the dominion of God, the Sovereign, the Most High, the Great. Strive then within thyself to attain unto that which hath been ordained for thee by thy Lord, for verily it shall never perish but shall endure as long as thy Lord, thy God, willeth. Then place thy trust in all things in Him, and verily He shall suffice thee above all peoples. Whoso possesseth the love of God is among the most affluent of men, though he should not have so much as a mustard seed of this world and its ornaments, and whoso is bereft thereof is the poorest of the poor, though he should possess the treasures of the heavens and the earth. Arise with utmost steadfastness in the Cause, then assist thy Lord, and be not of the patient ones. Verily His assistance is His remembrance amongst His servants and the promotion of His firm, unshakeable, and mighty Cause. Be thou enkindled with this crimson fire of the love of God, which blazeth from the midmost heart of the horizons, that thereby the servants may be set ablaze in their love for their Ancient Master.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Commit not that which is unseemly within yourselves, follow not the footsteps of Satan, speak naught save with pure truthfulness, and do not that which ye have been forbidden in the Book of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Glorious. Strive within yourselves that your stations with God may be elevated day by day, and be not of an evil people, the losers. Say: O people! Answer the call of God that hath been raised amongst you, and cast not His words behind your backs. Fear God and be of the God-fearing. Deprive not yourselves of this bounty which hath shone forth from the horizon of holiness with manifest sovereignty, which commandeth you to righteousness and guidance, and forbiddeth you from that which would remove you far from the good-pleasure of God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.</p>
<p>O people! Purify your hearts that the lights of your Lord’s revelation, the Merciful, the Compassionate, may be imprinted thereon. Then purify your tongues that they may move in remembrance of your Creator, for this is better for you than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth, were ye but to know. Verily, they who have turned away from God in these days, these are they whom their own selves and desires have overcome. Soon shall they return to dust with great sorrow and remorse. They shall find for themselves neither helper nor succourer, nor shall they find any protector to shield them from the punishment of a barren day. And they who have believed in God in these days, these shall God cause to ascend unto the holy place, the seat of mighty glory, and He shall send down upon them at all times from the wonders of His mercy which shall never be exhausted. Thus hath it been inscribed in the Tablets by a holy and luminous Pen. The Spirit, the glory and the splendor be upon thee and upon those who have followed that which hath been sent down unto them from a mighty and wondrous Kingdom.</p>

<p>Take heed, O people of insight! Take heed, O people of vision! Consider, O people of understanding! Those who were exalted by the name of Truth and who, claiming faith in Him, sat at the head of assemblies, reclining upon the seats of opposition, who issued the decree for the shedding of His pure blood, who denounced as infidels His near ones and the sincere ones, and who counted the most wretched and the opposers among the pure and faithful - they attributed corruption to Him whose very breath is the cause of the life of the world. This is not the first day whereon they have violated the Covenant of God and His Testament. Reflect upon the past ages and centuries, when the ignorant among the people, claiming knowledge, visited upon the Dawning-Places of Revelation and the Day-Springs of inspiration that which caused the dawn to lament, the afternoon to weep, and the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven to tremble. Yet God, exalted be His glory, has been and shall ever be with His party. In the early days they were opposers, deniers and calumniators, and after the exaltation of the Cause, they occupied pulpits and mosques, claiming faith in the Truth while busying themselves with ensnaring souls. Such is their wretchedness that God, exalted be His glory, hath spoken that which sufficeth every hearer. His blessed and exalted Word in the Qur’an declareth: “Truly, those among His servants who fear God are the learned ones.” Though the outward learned ones have interpreted this according to their own desires, yet every possessor of insight and vision can perceive its meaning. Through this verse God, exalted be His glory, intended to make known to His servants the wretchedness of such souls; otherwise, with but a single word He could bring the entire world to naught. The measures of earthly power cannot restrain His might, nor can the ranks of nations prevent the manifestations of His power. Were His all-pervading wisdom to so determine, He could with a single letter strip the world of the ornament of existence. These are they who, in the name of Truth, have barred the way to Truth, and who, while claiming to love Him, have opened for themselves the gates of earthly adornments. The opposers from among the people of the Bayan are today walking in those same footsteps. For one thousand two hundred years the misguided and misleading sect - namely the Shi’ih - both learned and ignorant among them, have occupied themselves with mention of guardian, successor, Imam, chief and noble, and such like, and such was the intensity of the hatred and animosity between their factions that each party would denounce the other as infidel and decree their death, while through the architects of suspicion and fancy they built up dominions. Finally, on the Day of Resurrection those suspicions and fancies were transformed into opposition and were visited upon the Lord of mankind that which was heard. This was the fruit of their beliefs, sayings and deeds. As to what will be the fruit of these new events, namely the objections of the opposers, the knowledge thereof is with God. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Your grief has saddened this servant and the manifestations of divine love, and its smoke well-nigh approached the sacred, pure, mighty and luminous hem of God. Each oppressed soul is mentioned before the Throne. By the life of our Purpose! They have attained that which none can reckon save Him Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the oppressed one who hath suffered in the path of God that which the chosen ones of God suffered throughout ages and centuries. If you remained awake at night, the Eye of God was with you - verily it slumbereth not. What fault had the Primal Point in the sight of the Ancient Beauty? What did the Seal of the Prophets do? Why did the Spirit ascend to the fourth heaven? Likewise the chosen ones and companions of those Daysprings of God’s Cause. You have many companions, but the Hand of God’s Power, exalted be His glory, is occupied with taking and giving. He is the Helper, He is the Giver, He is the Protector, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Repeatedly from the Tongue of Grandeur hath flowed this exalted word - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “The tabernacle of order in the world is upheld by two pillars: reward and punishment.” Assuredly the reward of the friends and the punishment of the enemies will become manifest and evident. After hearing what befell you, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered this blessed word: “Verily We were with them when the oppressors rose up against them, and We did witness and observe, and verily We are the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” Likewise the mention of that oppressed one who was wounded in God’s path has been and is before the Most Holy Court. Verily the Servant mentioneth him and giveth him glad tidings of the favors of his Lord, the Almighty. Another matter: the letters of that beloved of the heart arrived consecutively and were answered, and specially for some of them wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed, but their dispatch was delayed for wisdom’s sake. Now this brief message is sent, and likewise the receipt for the funds was honored with acceptance and distinguished by mention of its receipt. The request is that you convey greetings to each and all the kinsmen who are present in that land. By the life of our Purpose! The angels of heaven are grieved and saddened by the oppression that hath been wrought. This is what my Lord, the All-Hearing, hath informed Me. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid you, to grant you success, to protect you from the evil of His enemies, and to seize those who have denied His right, broken His covenant, and committed that which hath caused every fair-minded and discerning one to lament. Glory, praise and salutations be upon you, O party of God in the earth and Hands of His Cause in the lands.</p>

<p>This is a Book that speaketh with truth and wherein is mentioned that which draweth the people nigh unto God, their Creator, detacheth them from all who are in the heavens and the earth, and causeth them to voice the praise of their Lord at eventide and at dawn. Verily it is the Book of God unto all who are in the Concourse on High, and the holy Scriptures unto all who dwell in the Kingdom of eternity, and the Verses of the Command unto all who abide in the depths of the Names, and the Tablet of Glory unto all who are in the kingdom. Verily it is God’s testimony unto His creation, His proof unto His servants, His evidence unto His creatures, and His signs unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus hath the Sun of wisdom dawned from a holy and wondrous horizon. Follow ye the religion of God and His Faith, then the laws of God and His command, and follow not your desires in aught. This is better for you than all who dwell on earth together. Answer ye the call of God amongst you and differ not in His Cause. Thus hath the Command been inscribed by the finger of the Spirit in truth. Verily those who have denied the signs of God and associated partners with His Self, these are in an abyss of wrath, and God will not hearken unto their call though they should supplicate Him throughout the duration of His kingdom, for He is independent of all worlds. Hearken, O people, unto that which the Tongue of God addresseth you, and follow not those who bid you to transgression and wickedness. Follow Him Who commandeth you to righteousness and godliness that ye may find a path to God in these days in truth. And thou, O thou who gazest toward the sanctuary of holiness, take thou the cup of life in this paradise wherein shineth the beauty of the All-Merciful, then drink therefrom and fear no one. Put thy trust in God and He will protect thee from every wicked oppressor. Take thou the tablet of God and His sign, then return unto the servants and give them the glad tidings wherewith the Spirit hath given thee glad tidings at the time when there flowed from His lips the oceans of knowledge and wisdom from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Perchance thereby may be sanctified the hearts of all created things, and they may be detached from all that they possess and draw nigh unto the station which hath been upraised in the name of God from time immemorial.</p>
<p>O thou traveler! Taste of the fruits wherewith the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath been laden through these words that have been sent down from the King of Names, that thou mayest find thyself independent of all things and stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause, remembering His Name which was at that time witnessed as the Most Great Name from the horizon of glory. And when thou seest the loved ones of God, convey to them what hath befallen My Beauty. Say: By God, O people! The Joseph of Eternity hath fallen into the dark pit and findeth no helper save Him Who created Him and sent Him forth with the truth and made Him a bearer of glad tidings unto all the worlds. Beware lest the world and its ornaments occupy you from the remembrance of God, and lest the affairs of sovereignty turn you away from the direction of Him Who was remembered by the name of God. Beware lest ye commit what God hath forbidden you, and abandon what ye have been commanded by One Who is Mighty and Wise. And if adversity toucheth you, grieve not; rather, remember what hath befallen My wronged Self in this land wherefrom the feet of seekers were cut off. Remember God at eventide and at dawn, and forget Him not for less than a moment. Thus doth the Pen of Command enjoin you at this time. Act according to what ye have been commanded by One Who is Wise and All-Knowing. Neither grieve for what hath escaped you, nor rejoice in what ye are given, for the world and all that is therein shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, in Whose grasp is the kingdom of all things, and He, verily, encompasseth all things.</p>
<p>And thou, O emigrant servant, be thou assured in thyself, then thank God for having strengthened thee in His Cause and honored thee with meeting the Manifestation of His Self, and provided thee with the bounty which was sent down from the heaven of grace, and for His mercy which encompassed thee when thou didst enter the Sacred Precinct and didst hear the melodies of the Spirit, and the lights of the Countenance shone upon thee from the presence of the Self-Subsisting. By God! A single glance from thy Lord excelleth the treasures of the heavens and earth and all that was and will be, if thou be of them that know. And when thou departest from the city wherein the Beauty of the Cause hath established Himself, lay thy face upon the dust and say:</p>
<p>O my Lord! Praise be to Thee for Thy gracious gifts and wondrous bounties, whereby Thou hast caused me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self, honored me with His presence, made me hear His melodies, and brought me before Him. By Thy might! Were I to thank Thee for what Thou hast bestowed upon me throughout the duration of Thy sovereignty, it would still fall short of the wonders of Thy favors. But I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of Thy Name that hath encompassed all created things, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, speaking in praise of Thy Self, and mindful of Thy wondrous gifts. Verily, Thou hast ever been powerful over all things, and by Thy Self art able to do whatsoever Thou willest.</p>
<p>Thus have We taught thee and strengthened thee and aided thee in this Tablet that thou mayest stand firm in thy Lord’s Cause. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who circle round the House with radiant countenance and pure soul.</p>

<p>The City of Love. To His Honor Ustad ’Ali-Akbar-i-Banna, upon him be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>On the 19th of the month of Ramadan in the year 1301.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down water from the heaven of utterance and hath quickened thereby His servants, and Who hath sent unto them the Messengers and revealed unto them the Books that they might recognize the straight Path of God and His firm and mighty Command. But when the Call was raised among them they denied it and turned away therefrom, save those who held fast to the Sure Handle and clung to the hem of the robe of grace and bounty. And blessings and peace and mercy and glory and praise and salutations be upon the loved ones of God and His chosen ones who have arisen to serve Him in His lands and to exalt His Word among His servants.</p>
<p>And now, to be brief - for God is my witness that time has become as narrow as the eye of a needle - I shall write what is necessary. Your second letter has arrived, though previously an extensive Tablet had already been sent down from the heaven of the favor of the Desired One of the worlds, specifically addressed to you, along with the Tablets you had requested. Surely these must have reached you by now. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and implore Him to protect His loved ones and preserve them from the croaking of the croakers, the clamor of the heedless, and the schemes of the plotters. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>The Cause is most great, and whatsoever shall come to pass in these days shall likewise be great. I beseech and implore God to give all to drink of the Kawthar of steadfastness, in such wise that should the whole world become the embodiment of utterance or the essence of knowledge, it would not prevent them from the Truth. The croaking is raised up in all regions and may well appear from the Land of the Desired One also. This is what I heard with mine own ears from the Tongue of Grandeur and Power. But the knights in the field of steadfastness cannot be deterred by the hosts of the world, nor can what they possess constitute a barrier.</p>
<p>A letter arrived from the Green Land from our honored master, His Honor Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, wherein he made mention of that spiritual friend. Likewise our honored master, His Honor Amin, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, repeatedly mentioned you during the days he attained the presence, especially one day when he spoke of you in the presence. Praise be to God that you are the recipient of the favors of the Desired One of the worlds. This evanescent servant beseeches and implores God, exalted and glorified be He, to ever assist and confirm you and keep you safe beneath the shade of the Tree of Grace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I convey greetings and salutations to the friends in that land. Your deed is acceptable before God, exalted be His glory. One day these supreme words were heard from the Mouth of the Will of the Lord of all beings, exalted and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O servant present! His Honor ’Ali-Akbar has long been occupied with serving the Cause. We have heard what he hath spoken, and We do hear and see, for We are the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. This time too he hath set out at the behest of the Afnan of the Blessed Tree. Blessed is he and blessed are those with him and his brothers. Give him these glad tidings from Me that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Verily his reward is with his Lord, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Time and again they have been blessed with mention of the Beloved of the worlds, and permission has already been granted. If wisdom requireth it, they may turn thereto - there hath been and is no harm in this. This is yet another glad-tiding. Should they write to the Land or anything else, this servant should convey special greetings from me to the friends of God, particularly to His Holiness the Trustee, upon him be the glory of God. The intention is that this servant hath made mention of them and continueth to do so, and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to grant them success.</p>
<p>As to what they wrote regarding the known sum that was lost, the loss thereof falleth upon His Holiness the Afnan, upon him be all the most glorious glory. After this word was presented before the Throne, the Supreme Pen stated: “In this Most Great Revelation, the Supreme Pen hath made mention of them as being among the Afnan in the Crimson Book and other Tablets. In this case no loss shall fall upon them; nay, rather, there is gain upon gain, and wealth upon wealth. Soon shall they witness the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of bounty.” End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth God to assist them in that which is befitting, in such wise that they may be observed to be ever more enkindled in the Cause of God and in service unto it. Yet, by the life of our Beloved! from the beginning until now they have stood firm and remain firm. The Supreme Pen hath testified to what I have submitted; therefore the testimony of this mere nonentity is and was pure nothingness. Once again I convey greetings and glorification to all the friends in that land. Glory and praise and glorification be upon you and upon those who are with you among the loved ones of God, and upon those who have quaffed the sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of our Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And praise be to God, the Possessor of what was and what shall be.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the fragrances of the Divine Word are diffused, the sweet scent of His garment is wafted abroad, and the light of His Cause is radiant. Blessed are those souls whom doubts and idle fancies did not prevent from the Dayspring of certitude - they heard the call and responded, turning with heart and soul to the supreme horizon. Their aim in all conditions hath been the good-pleasure of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. With radiant faces, pure hearts, and enlightened breasts they have arisen to serve His Cause. These are they who move by His Will and rest by His Will. Their purpose in all matters hath been the grace of Him Who conversed on Sinai, and their aspiration to attain the presence of Him Who hath appeared. Exalted be their station, their glory, and their power! For the opposition of the world did not hinder them, nor did the might of rulers weaken them. They appear with complete power. Upon them be the glory of God and the lights of His mighty throne.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou seest Thy servant whom Thou hast made to be attracted by Thy verses and enkindled with the fire of Thy love. He desires to mention one of Thy loved ones who is named ’Ali-before-Akbar in Thy Most Great View. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy most exalted Paradise and Thy most sublime Garden, and by the Sun of Thy grace which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of bounty, to assist him in Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and the service of Thy Cause. O Lord! Deny him not the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance in Thy days, and ordain for him what Thou hast ordained for the chosen ones among Thy servants. Aid him with the hosts of the unseen and the visible. Verily, Thou art the Lord of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And then, it is submitted that for some time no news has outwardly been received from that spiritual beloved. God willing, may they be protected and preserved in all conditions within the fortress of divine protection. The loved ones of that land have been and are remembered, and for each I beseech divine confirmation and assistance. Today, being the third of the blessed month of Ramadan, I am commanded to mention this matter: According to what they have written, the honored consort of the beloved and esteemed Nazir, upon him be the glory of God, is traveling in that direction, and they have written that two persons are accompanying her - one being Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad and the other an outsider. In this case, the coming of that outsider is in no way advisable. Therefore, if they prevent that person and instead have one or two of those souls who have intended to visit the Most Holy Court and have been honored with permission accompany her, this would be acceptable and beloved before God. They commanded: Write to His Honor ’Ali-before-Akbar, upon him be My glory - the loved ones of God must in all conditions be vigilant regarding the Command of God and act toward His friends and loved ones in a manner that is befitting. Soon shall all the deeds, actions, manifestations and appearances of the world return to nothingness. That which occurs for the sake of God and in His path is recorded and inscribed by the Divine Pen in the eternal tablet. Today, service to the Truth is service to His loved ones, for the Prisoner is outwardly prevented from what is befitting. Therefore, whatever appears regarding His friends and loved ones is attributed to Him and counted as service to Him. Blessed are those souls whom love of the world and its ornaments did not prevent and deprive from service. They are among those who are near to God in His Book, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings unto the friends of God, who are known and distinguished in the Book as the people of Baha. He beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to set each one of them ablaze with His love, that they may, through their utterance, draw all created things unto the horizon of the All-Merciful and discharge their obligations towards the friends of God. The people of Baha are accounted before God as the people of justice and fairness in all cities. Well is it with them, and joy be unto them! After the arrival of the honored consort of the esteemed Nazir, upon him be the glory and favor of God, they should, according to their means, attend to their affairs of whatever kind, and if funds are needed there, they should give and arrange for them to be transferred, and payment shall be made. This servant beseecheth his Lord to aid His loved ones to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. As for Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad who is with them, it would be more pleasing if he were to remain in that city and engage in commerce. Convey my greetings unto him. Praise be to God, they are mentioned in His presence, and another person was previously mentioned as well. If, instead of these two souls, those friends who have permission were to attend to this matter, it would be and is more fitting, more pleasing and more excellent. Glory and praise be upon you and upon those with you, and upon them that have acted according to that which was enjoined upon them by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>These are verses of the Spirit that have verily descended from clouds of supreme sorrow, and wert thou to behold with the eye of the spirit, thou wouldst witness that its drops fall with the hue of blood, and thus doth it distill from clouds of grief, if thou be of them that perceive. And besides these, in My right hand is the chalice of tribulation and in My left hand the cup of destiny, and thus hath the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Wise ordained for My exalted Self. By God! The realities of all things weep at what hath befallen My Beauty, and then the realities of the Concourse on High at the adversities that have touched Me from those who were created by My word, if ye be of them that know. And sorrows have reached such a degree that the servants whom We had preserved in the treasuries of Our protection and safeguarded from the harm of the worlds rose up against My countenance. By God! The tongue cannot move to describe what hath befallen the Beauty of the All-Merciful, nor can the Pen flow to recount what hath descended upon the Ancient King, nor can the ink tell what hath trickled down upon the Lord of creation from these associators. Then incline thou the ear of thy spirit unto all things, that thou mayest hear their lamentation, and then once again unto the realities of the Concourse of creation - by God, thou shalt hear their outcry - and yet again unto the tongues of the mystics in the station of eternity, whereupon thou shalt hear from them a grievous and tender cry, as though it issueth from the wellspring of sorrow, and they speak thus: “By God! This is the Ancient Beauty among these people, and there hath befallen Him what hath befallen no one before.” Therefore, O denizens of the chambers of Paradise, strike ye upon your breasts, then upon your heads, then upon your thighs in this sorrow that hath encompassed the Beauty of ancient glory. O Rida! Thus have We related unto thee from the stories of the Cause, that thou mayest be informed of what hath befallen Us from these associators. Then know thou that these people have devised a plot which, by the True One, were all the devils to gather to comprehend it, they would confess themselves impotent - thus doth the Tongue of God, the Holy Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, testify. Were We to lift for thee the veils of concealment, thou wouldst grieve in thy soul, and all created things would grieve thereat. Therefore have We concealed it and been patient until God shall bring about His purpose, for no matter occurreth save after His leave. He sendeth down what He willeth through the sovereignty of His Command, and He is, verily, powerful over all things. Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord to such a degree that even if thou wert to become the only one in all the world among those who have believed in God and His signs, thou wouldst arise by thyself and help thy Lord to the extent of thy capacity, and be among the helpers. Thus doth it behoove thee and those like thee, that perchance some of the servants may become aware thereby and be among those who arise. Although We witness that intoxication hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth, such that I find not in anyone the fragrance of life - nay, all are as dead before thy Lord, save those who have laid hold of the Most Great Handle in this firm and mighty Cord. Therefore hold thou fast, lest the winds of polytheism move thee, and be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord, mentioning the people at all times and being of them that remember. Then know thou that whatsoever God commandeth His servants, this is of His grace unto them; otherwise He verily supporteth His Cause by Himself and is independent of the help of the heavens and earth and of all the worlds - even as some of His servants rose up against Him and desired to slay the Youth, but God preserved Him with hosts of angels and brought Him forth from their midst and sent down unto Him verses of power[…]</p>
<p>He hath sent down upon him verses of might and power, and thus doth He assist whomsoever He pleaseth through the hosts of His invisible realm. Do they who have denied the verses of God imagine within themselves that they believe in God, the Mighty, the Most High, the Great? Nay, by My Self! The very name of faith shall never apply to them, much less its reality, were ye of them that comprehend. Say: Faith is to know the Manifestation of God’s Self and that which proceedeth from Him. How can one who hath turned away and denied that which he once believed be counted among the faithful? Say: This Day shall no soul’s faith profit it unless it detacheth itself from all who are in the heavens and on earth and entereth beneath the shadow of the Countenance. This is a revelation from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Say: O people! Render not your deeds null and void, nor refute the truth with your own devices. Flee from your own selves, then turn unto God that He may forgive you through His grace. Verily, He is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. He forgiveth whom He willeth and chastiseth whom He willeth. Verily, He is the Single One, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Bountiful. And thou, take the chalice of life from the youth of the Spirit, then drink it in My Name, the Best-Beloved. Keep it secret within thyself and fear no one. Trust at all times in God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Thus have We cast upon thee the verses of thy Lord that thou mayest be informed of thy Master’s love for thee and be among those who are steadfast in His love. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and turned away from the manifestations of Satan.</p>

<p>O Leaf of Ridvan, may the noblewoman take note: “O God! Curse the first oppressor who oppressed the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation, who denied His verses, who fought against Him in person, who disputed His sovereignty, who associated partners with His Being, who denied His words, who turned away from His beauty, and who was recorded in God’s Tablets from the Holy Pen as being among the idolaters.”</p>
<p>He is the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The letter from that Leaf of Ridvan was received and read. Although in these days sorrow hath so encompassed Us that no joy can dispel it and no gladness can drive it away, nevertheless the loving words of that enraptured leaf bestowed some measure of delight upon this withered heart. What benefit is there when ye know not what hath come to pass? I swear by the peerless Beauty, the All-Glorious, that I am astonished at those souls who are content with a mere speck of dust and remain veiled from the sovereign Lord Who doeth whatsoever He willeth. In any case, when the hand of divine power banished those who had risen up to destroy the countenance of God and prevented them from achieving their purpose, they resorted to spreading calumnies by tongue and pen. Would that there were people of insight who could perceive from their words their false accusations. They have attributed miserliness to the Source of generosity from Whose table of bounty most of the people of the Bayan have eaten and tasted, and they have imputed tyranny to that Most Holy and Pure Essence, Who is the very embodiment of justice and Whose very being was created from His Will. For God’s sake, would that an eye could be found to witness the repugnant deeds and actions of those who hate the Divine Beauty! In any case, in these days the odor of associating partners with God hath been diffused. God willing, from pure and assured hearts there must needs appear a wondrous and lofty steadfastness.</p>
<p>O Leaf of Ridvan! Give thanks to God that thou hast been singled out as a handmaiden of God and been related to Him. From the right hand of the Throne hath been sent down: “O handmaiden of the Ancient Beauty! On this day the glance of God is directed toward the hearts of His servants and handmaidens. In whomsoever is kindled the fire of His love, that one is mentioned before Him by every one of His most beautiful names.” Such is the grace and mercy of thy Lord that hath encompassed thee and His loved ones. Know thou the value of these days and be occupied at all times with His praise and glorification. Be not grieved by the world, for ere long it shall pass away. Strive thou that in this transient world pure, holy and sincere deeds and actions may appear from that handmaiden of God solely for His sake, for all good lieth in His good-pleasure and in naught else. God willing, mayest thou ever walk in the path of His good-pleasure and remain turned toward His beauty.</p>
<p>The words of God are ended.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding what thou didst mention about sacrificing thy life in the path of the Beloved, this was presented before the Throne. He said: If thou keepest thy life alive through His praise, this would be closer to righteousness in the sight of God today and will continue to be so, for perchance through thy mention others may be reminded of the wondrous ways of remembering Him. Therefore, preserve thy life with the utmost tenderness that it may ever be occupied with His remembrance, and if the time for sacrificing life should come, it will assuredly be offered up.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>[…] was submitted before the Throne. From the heaven of loving-kindness a glorious Tablet was revealed and sent to be delivered. And this servant’s other supplication before that leaf is that she record this servant’s name as ‘Servant of God’ and ‘His servant’ as I myself submit, for it was observed that one whom they designated with all divine names and described with attributes - in the end these very names became the cause of his pride such that he rose to wage war against the Beauty of God. Therefore, regarding this servant and other friends who have drunk from the cup of Baha, if in the station of description you would mention them with these words that were stated, it has been and will be more beloved in the sight of God, for glory and grandeur and majesty and all names and their kingdom and all attributes and their dominion have circled and will circle round the Ancient Being, and none besides Him is worthy. God willing this servant’s petition will find acceptance. And furthermore, at all times write of your circumstances and news, although there is the possibility that the means of correspondence may be cut off, yet with God are new creations after new creations and decrees after decrees, and verily He has power over all things. And the spirit and glory and splendor be upon you and upon those with you in the path of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. All the people of the pavilion of the sanctuary send their most glorious greetings. [A portion marked with […] has been cut from the original Tablet]</p>

<p>He is the One established upon the throne of “He doeth what He willeth”</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the grandeur and power, might and authority. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He desireth through His command. He is indeed praised in His deeds and obeyed in His decree. None can question His doings and He is the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and He Who hath come from the horizon of power is verily the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Symbol, and He is the One through Whom appeared God’s sovereignty and might, God’s grandeur and command, and through Whom shone forth God’s proof and evidence, and God’s Book and mysteries. Were it not for Him, the ocean of bounty would not have surged, nor would the decree of existence have been established, nor would the nightingales of utterance have warbled upon the branches, nor would the matter of the unseen have been confirmed among religions. Through Him were God’s Books sent down aforetime and thereafter, His messengers dispatched, His mercy made to precede all else, His verses revealed, His clear proofs made manifest, and the tongues of the Concourse on High and the Supreme Paradise testified and proclaimed: O peoples of earth and heaven! By God, He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities hath come! Come ye, come ye! Glorify, magnify, and rejoice in the wafting of the breezes of care and kindness from the direction of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>When the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree was raised, it called out saying: Praise be to God Who hath made marriage a portal for the manifestation of the dawning-places of His name, the All-Merciful, and through it have the cities of remembrance and utterance been adorned. Verily it is the mystery of perpetuity and the secret of destiny after decree for the people of creation, and through it hath flowed the Salsabil of life for those possessed of certitude. And praise be to God Who hath made wedlock a means for the promotion of His Cause among His servants and the proclamation of His Word throughout His lands. Through it hath shone forth the Day-Star of Revelation from the heaven’s horizon and the Hidden Temple appeared from behind the kingdom of names, and the Holy Spirit called out from the right side of the most exalted Paradise: This is the day whereon the Sovereign of Religions hath commanded, by reason of which the countenance of existence hath smiled in both the unseen and the visible worlds.</p>
<p>And praise be to God Who hath made marriage the treasury of prosperity and the dawning-place of success. Through it appeared His greatest outpouring and His most upright, perfect, and complete bounty, and He exalted its station to such a degree that He Himself performed the ceremony upon the throne of His bestowal. By this did the ocean of joy surge before His Manifestation, through Whom all things spoke, and the Most Exalted Paradise proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Rejoice ye on this day, then recite what hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen of the verses of joy and gladness. These shall draw you to a station wherein neither the happenings of the world, nor the smoke of heaven, nor what existeth in the realm of creation shall grieve you. Thus hath shone forth the Day-Star of judgment from the horizon of the heaven of God’s will, the Fashioner of the heavens and the Lord of all names. Blessed is he who hath found what hath today been diffused from the utterance of God, the Lord of the hereafter and the former times, and hath heard what the Tongue of Revelation hath spoken from the most exalted station. Verily He is the Lord of all mankind and the Sovereign of the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my God, and glory be unto Thee, O my God, and majesty be unto Thee, O my God, and generosity be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of the nations, and bounty be unto Thee, O Thou Lord of existence, and grace be unto Thee, O Thou Manifestation of justice, and beneficence be unto Thee, O Thou Lord of all humanity, and loving-kindness be unto Thee, O Thou Worshipped One of all creation, inasmuch as Thou hast made marriage a means for the unity of Thy creation and the exaltation of Thy Word amongst Thy servants. Through it Thou hast united hearts and manifested the tokens of Thy Best-Beloved Name, and through it have been revealed the hidden mysteries concealed behind the Qaf of Thy power, and the earth and heaven have been illumined with the light of Thy providence. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the Luminary of Thy proof which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy prison, to aid Thy loved ones to achieve unity and harmony, that through them the horizons of Thy dominion may be illumined. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent One Whom the conditions of Thy creation cannot frustrate, nor can the clamor of Thy servants dismay. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful. Thanks be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of them that know Thee, and praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art remembered in the hearts of the sincere ones, and glory be unto Thee, O Glory of the worlds, inasmuch as Thou hast bestowed one of the leaves of Thy Lote-Tree, who was named after ‘Meeting’ in the Kingdom of Names, unto Thy Most Great Branch, and hast made her specially devoted to His service on this Day whereon Thou hast manifested Thyself unto mankind through Thy Name, O Thou Lord of destiny. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Name through which Thou hast illumined the lands and united the hearts of Thy servants, to unite them both, then send down upon them the blessings of Thy heaven, then cause to appear from the earth Thy bounties and favors. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, possessed of great favor. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Munificent, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Rahim who hath migrated and attained! He is the All-Knowing Witness! On this day the Wronged One calleth out from the Most Great Prison unto the peoples of the world and summoneth them unto the Most Great Ocean. His Cause is more manifest than the sun and His utterance is as the rays of light. No fair-minded one can deny this greatest bounty, nor can any just one reject this supreme gift. This is the Day of confession and acknowledgment, for the Truth, exalted be His glory, is established upon the throne of recognition and speaketh as befitteth Him. This is that Manifestation which was mentioned in the Books of old and inscribed by the Pen of God. Convey My greetings unto the loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. I swear by the waves of the ocean of the Merciful’s utterance that all are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and have attained His grace. We beseech God to assist all to remain steadfast in His mighty Cause and not to deprive His servants of the eternal feast and everlasting bounty. Convey greetings unto the people of Ba and Dal from the Wronged One and say: O friends! Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom and speak with moderation. One word is like unto fire that consumeth, and another word is like unto light that illumineth. Cleave ye unto gentleness and forbearance. God is merciful and His mercy precedeth all; God is generous and His generosity encompasseth all. Some are weak - they must be healed and strengthened through the remedy of mention and utterance. Moderation is necessary in all things, for if strength exceedeth its bounds it turneth into weakness. O friends! The Most Exalted Pen counseleth you and biddeth you to that which exalteth the Word of God and uplifteth souls. Hold fast unto moderation in all conditions and speak with equity in all matters. The enemies are inflamed with the fire of ignorance - one must resort to patience that perchance it may be quenched and calmed. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist you in that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to enable you to observe that which ye have been commanded in the Book.</p>
<p>O Rahim! If thou shouldst reach the verdant land say: Where are thy trees and thy fruits? Where are thy mysteries and thy flowers? O verdant land! Where is thy bounty? Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. God shall soon manifest from thee what He hath ordained for thee. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. We send greetings to the loved ones of that land and beseech God to assist them in that which is befitting, that they may give life to the servants through the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Make mention of the people of that land from the Wronged One and say: Praise be to the Goal of all creation Who enabled you and caused you to attain unto His days. Know ye the value of this station. Praise be to God that through the Most Great Word ye have attained unto the effulgent lights of the Sun of Divine Unity while the divines of the earth have fled from the Word and have strayed from the divine path. Convey greetings unto the people of God in the land of M and Sh that perchance through the breaths of the utterance of the Goal of the worlds they may be enabled to perform such deeds as shall endure forever in God’s Book throughout the kingdom of names and attributes. Wisdom requireth the concealment of names, now and in the past. Thus hath spoken the Creator of the heavens when He was established upon the throne of His Name, the Concealer, the All-Wise. O My loved ones! Soon shall all that is visible vanish away. Prepare yourselves and be ready for ascension. Verily He will assist you and command you to that which will draw you nigh and exalt you. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in ’Ayn and Shin! Time and again ye have been favored with the tokens of the Most Exalted Pen and adorned with the lights of the utterance of Him Who is the Desired One of the worlds. Know ye the value of this station and hold fast unto service to His Cause. Today the Euphrates of mercy is flowing and the ocean of grace is manifest. O thou who gazest upon Me, My glory be upon thee! Thou hast ever been and art still beneath the glances of loving-kindness. We beseech God to aid thee in a service the very mention of which shall awaken them that slumber. This is not difficult for God to accomplish. The honored ’Ali-i-Akbar hath been and still is mentioned. Praise be to God, he is enabled to celebrate the praise of Him Who is the Wronged One of the horizons. Ever in the Most Great Prison hath the tongue been speaking, the Pen moving, and the Face turned, that there might appear from the servants that which God shall make a treasure for them with Him. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whosoever hath heard the murmuring of the Kawthar of My utterance, hath drawn nigh, hath taken and drunk in the name of God, the Lord of sovereignty over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>O Nasr! He is the Glorious, the All-Glorious!</p>
<p>By the True One! That which hath been presented before the Throne from thy words regarding thy recognition of the Self of God, thy steadfastness in His Cause, thy certitude in His commandments, thy turning unto His countenance, and thy reliance upon His Self, is better than all that hath appeared from him whom We adorned with a name from among the names between earth and heaven. Know thou, therefore, what thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, intendeth thereby, that thou mayest find within thy heart the lights of God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. This bounty shall endure for thee if thou remainest steadfast in the steadfastness of thy Lord and seeketh shelter beneath the shade of His mercy. Thus doth the Herald of the Cause give thee glad tidings that thou mayest be of them that rejoice in the glad tidings of the Cause.</p>
<p>By God! Were We to find people of eloquence in this Revelation, We would assuredly cast upon them that which no ear of them that have passed before hath ever heard. Thus is thy Lord powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Supreme, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O Word of Victory! Behold with the eye of the Beginning these idolaters and what they say. By the True One! Naught issueth from their mouths save that which exhaleth the stench of malice, in such wise as to grieve the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise in their crimson chambers and the people of the Realm of Divine Command in the heaven of eternity. Thus have the mysteries of the Cause been sent down in truth, and it is indeed a revelation from One All-Glorious, All-Praised.</p>
<p>Leave them to themselves, to that which they possess, and to that which proceedeth from their mouths. Cast their heads beneath thy feet, then emerge, detached from all veils and allusions, that thou mayest be empowered to speak in the kingdom of names with the name of the Sovereign of attributes, and warble with such melody, and sing with such voice, and cry with such cry, and beat such rhythms as would cause the manifestations of the mirrors to swoon, let alone those who are veiled and are immersed in the depths of their own selves.</p>
<p>By God, O Nasr! On this Day none shall be mentioned before the throne of thy Lord save him who hath rent asunder all veils and ascended unto the heights of holiness, the scene of thy Lord, the Most High, the Powerful, the Witnessed. Say: O people! Do ye cling to the frailest of houses and flee from the stronghold of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting? Are ye content with a mirage while depriving yourselves of this Sweet, Holy, Surging, Pleasant and Beloved Sea? Break all cups, then take the cup of independence from the hands of the youth of Glory, in My Most Holy and Transcendent Name. This is God’s command upon thee. Act, therefore, as thou art bidden and fear no one. He will protect thee through His sovereign protection and will sanctify thee from doubts in these days wherein the people are encompassed by the darkness of vain imaginings and are veiled within themselves.</p>
<p>Say: O people! By God, this is a Day which no other days have preceded, nor hath it been comprehended by the comprehension of any comprehender, nor the knowledge of any knower, nor the mind of any thinker, nor the sight of any seer, nor the vision of any beholder, save him who hath turned unto the Most Great Horizon, the Holy and Most Pure Scene of his Lord. Thus doth the Spirit speak, yet the people hear not.</p>
<p>Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord, then call the people to remembrance in this Most Great Scene, that perchance they may become aware within themselves and perceive within their own beings, and turn unto the Holy Dawning Place, and be of those whom nothing whatsoever in all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth can veil from that which was created between the heavens and the earth, and who find no rest save upon the seat of glory - a station of praised glory.</p>
<p>Taste thou the sweetness of remembrance from this Cup which We have manifested upon the Temple of the Tablet.</p>
<p>And this is the station of glorious praise! Taste thou the sweetness of remembrance from this cup which We have manifested in the form of a Tablet and sent forth in truth, for verily We have ever been the Sender. We have dispatched it unto thee that thou mayest solace thereby thy heart, and that it may stir thee with a subtle and lofty movement wherewith all existence is stirred. Thus hath thy Lord’s favor been perfected unto thee and unto them that swim in the depths of this ocean. We have ordained for thee from the divine Ridvan the spirit of fellowship, and for them who are steadfast in their love of God, their Creator, and are of those who remain firm. Then remind, from Our presence, thy kindred who have believed in God and His signs, and whom God hath assisted to rend the veils in these days wherein every soul is found behind a mighty veil. Then convey unto them that which hath appeared from the Self of the Most Merciful, that they may rejoice throughout all worlds and among the concourse of all realms. Then make mention of him who hath been named with the first letter of My name, the Most Pure, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, that he may remember the Most Great Remembrance in this wise Remembrance.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Whom all worship, though they perceive it not!</p>
<p>This is a Book that speaketh the truth, wherein lieth mercy for all the worlds. From but one letter of that which hath been sent down in this sacred, blessed, mighty and wondrous verse, God hath created heavens whose number none can reckon save God, the Lord of all creation. In each heaven He hath ordained clouds bearing His name, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, raining upon all created things that which purifieth them from the mention of aught else but Him. This, verily, is the truth certain.</p>
<p>By God the Truth! Should all created things turn, in less than a twinkling of an eye, to those clouds raised up by the truth in but one of the heavens created by a single letter of thy Lord’s Book, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great, they would be purified from all things and would give voice to that which the Dove hath warbled in the midmost heart of eternity, and to that which reached the ears of Moses in the Sinai of the divine presence, when one of Our most beauteous names was manifested. Thus doth the Pen of Command impart its message, that perchance mankind may find a path unto God.</p>
<p>O Rida! Hearken unto the melodies of eternity from the Pen of Glory, by one note whereof the fire was kindled in the realms of eternity, then in the cities of names, then in the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. Take thou a brand therefrom, that thou mayest kindle all created things and turn them toward the court of God, the All-Possessing, the Most Holy, the Mighty, the Powerful. Perchance thereby warmth may be generated in the hearts of those who have grown cold through the chill of this world and its ornaments, and who have remained heedless of this Sun that hath shone forth from the horizon of grace, its rays encompassing all worlds.</p>
<p>Tarry not for a moment in propagating the Cause of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Powerful, the Ancient of Days. Detach thyself wholly from all else but God, thy Lord, that thy words may influence the hearts of all creation. Say: O people! Know ye God by God and by that which proceedeth from Him. Thus have We commanded you in all the Tablets and in that which We sent down unto ’Ali before Nabil.</p>
<p>O people! Fear ye God, then be ashamed before Him Who was suspended in the air and sacrificed Himself in the path of God, the Just King, the All-Informed. By God! He sacrificed Himself for naught else but to manifest that which hath been manifested in these days. Yet ye, O people of the Bayan, have remained heedless of that which was intended and have clung to your own idle fancies, without any clear authority or enlightening Book.</p>
<p>Say: Would ye slay the Manifestation of God’s Self with your swords while ye make mention of Him with your tongues? What aileth these people that they fail to comprehend even a single utterance from God, the Speaking, the Manifest, the All-Evident? Say: O people! Do ye claim that ye have believed in God and His signs, after ye have turned away from His resplendent, radiant and luminous beauty? Would ye find peace within yourselves after the head of the Youth was raised upon the spears of hatred by these idolaters, crying out “Is there any helper who will help ’Ali who was before, then Muhammad before him, then the Spirit before him, then He Whom We sent in the name of Moses?”</p>
<p>O people! This is indeed ’Ali in truth, who hath appeared with such evidence as hath rendered powerless all who are in the heavens and on the earth. He reciteth unto you at every moment from verses of which a single letter surpasseth all things, were ye of them that know. If ye deny them, by what proof do ye uphold your belief in God? Produce it, if ye be truthful! Nay, by My Self! Every cord hath been severed from you save that ye take hold of this firm and mighty handle.</p>
<p>O people! Act not as did the peoples of former times, nor compare the Self of God with aught else […]</p>
<p>Compare not the Soul of God with any other, nor His words with that which people utter, nor what He possesseth with what ye possess, if ye be of those who comprehend. Say: He hath appeared with a sovereignty which no one can dispute except by disbelieving in God and being accounted among the idolaters. And thou, O servant, know that when We first began this Tablet, We intended to recount unto thee what had befallen Us, but at this moment came the Divine Decree from the realm of the unseen; therefore We stayed Our Pen from its mention lest thou be grieved with a sorrow that would sadden thy heart and the hearts of the seekers. Soon shalt thou hear, if God should will and desire, and verily He shall make mention of His Cause through the tongue of His patient servants. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened unto thy words concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of the hereafter and of the former times, and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>O servant! Fear God in thine own self and abide under Our protection in such wise that nothing shall grieve thee nor shall any matter trouble thee. Thus do We cast upon thee from the sweet-scented breaths of His holiness that thou mayest be established upon the throne of detachment by the leave of the All-Merciful. Even shouldst thou possess all the hidden treasures of the unseen realm, which those who have tasted the love of the Youth possess, they would not divert thee from the beauty of God, Who hath dawned in truth from this horizon which was witnessed upon the cloud of the Cause from the heaven of this atmosphere. Strive thou within thyself, then struggle in thine own being, lest anything prevent thee from the love of thy Lord, for in these days the breezes of temptation have blown from the direction of tests, causing leaves to fall even as the autumn winds cause them to fall - thus hath the Cause been known in truth. Hold fast unto this Tree which hath been raised in truth, beneath whose shade none can rest save those who have detached themselves from all things. Thus doth the Dove of the Cause warble between earth and heaven, that perchance thereby the servants of the All-Merciful may hasten to the shore of this bounty which hath been raised up in justice. If thou wouldst remember within thyself and remind others of this Most Great Remembrance, it would be better for thee than all thou witnessest and beholdest. This is what hath now been sent down from the Pen of the Cause upon a preserved holy tablet.</p>
<p>Then mention the generous one from Our presence that he may receive glad tidings within his essence, and perchance detach himself from his self and desires, and ascend to praiseworthy heights of sanctity. Then remind him that We have not issued an explicit command regarding thy daughter, but rather We revealed it in the name of the Penitent One, whom ye have not known and who remained forsaken among you. And We commanded him to choose her for himself with joy and fragrance, should he be content in his soul and she content in her soul. Thus was the command sent down from the horizon of wisdom by the Pen of Glory. And We commanded him thus after his letter came before Us and he sought permission from God, his Lord, to send her to this Station which was sanctified above turning to the worlds. But if she were to rend asunder the veils of fancy from her face, she would find from Him what cannot be found from any other, and thy Lord is indeed knowing of what I say. But since the veils of fancy have not been rent from the eyes of created things, they pay no heed to what they say and will never recognize the beauty of the Cause when it was established in truth upon the heaven of exalted glory. By God! If she but knew, all who are in the heavens and earth could not compare with My Cause. But time has brought Me low through what ye have imagined within yourselves, and ye have deprived yourselves of the beauty of glory. O concourse of creation! By God the Truth! That which hath appeared cannot be compared with the command of all that hath been created in the kingdoms of creation, nor can the knowledge of the mystics, the eloquence of the eloquent, nor the learning of any possessor of distinction attain unto the precincts of His sanctity. Thus hath the Dove warbled with melodies the like of which have never been raised in the realm of possibility, that perchance souls may be attracted thereby and ascend to the station which was mentioned behind the veil of reason in the pavilion of love. O Javad! If thou wilt purify thy heart from attachment to the world and all that is therein, and with a holy and merciful spirit enter the right side of the blessed vale of divine oneness in Sinai, then in this case thou art permitted and it is fitting and timely. And it is known that the bird of the yearning heart in separation is like a fish writhing upon the dust. Verily the mystical fish of holiness seeketh to swim in the Most Great Ocean of the Lord and the deprived seeker yearneth for the sanctuary of the Intended One. However these are days the like of which the eye of creation hath never seen, and a mighty test hath come to pass. God willing, one must cling to the strong cord of grace and hold fast to the cloud of mercy, that perchance He may illumine spiritual eyes with the beauty of the divine Youth and not deprive the seekers of the Kaaba of the All-Merciful and the dwellers in the sanctuary of divine holiness from the wonders of His bounty. As for the one addressed in the Temple, it is the outward form of His Most Holy Temple, and - exalted be His grandeur - at times He addresseth His outward form with the tongue of His inward reality, and likewise the reverse. Thus hast thou heard and continues to hear before the Throne, and thou art among those who hear.</p>

<p>He is the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Wondrous, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Your poetry written on the page expressing kindness towards this servant was received. After perusing it, at an appointed time I brought it before the Most Holy and Supreme Threshold and presented it. He commanded: Write that, God willing, may you never falter and may you ever remain steadfast on the path of mighty oneness, for today if all who are in the heavens and earth were each to possess feet numbering as the sands of the desert, the waves of the seas, the leaves of the trees and the drops of rain, and all were to appear outwardly firm and strong, yet were not steadfast upon this straight path, assuredly all these feet would be accounted as broken and non-existent before God. But should even a gnat with broken feet remain firm and steadfast in this Cause, it would be accepted before God and be immortally remembered in the divine paradise. Therefore you must, through the wondrous favors of God and the gifts of the Sovereign Lord of Oneness, remain so firm and steadfast in the Cause of God as to become the cause of steadfastness in all others. And this is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>The glance of the All-Merciful’s favor hath ever been directed towards you. God willing, may you pass your days in the utmost joy and delight in the love of God, and may you ever remain in health and comfort with the loved ones of God - those who are embarked upon the Most Glorious Ark. For association with these loved ones is, before God, more beloved than all else. I swear by God that to gaze upon these faces is greater and more acceptable than seventy years of worship, for until a soul is created from a wondrous drop of the clay of divine love and the water of His affection, and becomes detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth, it shall never be capable of entering this blessed Ark and this Ship of sublime glory. We therefore hope that, God willing, you may remain settled, steadfast, firm and at rest in this Ark of the Lord of Lords. The grace is in His hands; verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient. And glory be upon you and upon the steadfast servants of God.</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Your missive, adorned with loving allusions and effusions of attraction, was received and presented before the Divine Throne, whereupon it was stated: “The Servant of the One has fallen into the well of envy, and the Youth of the Spirit into the prison of hatred, and the Ancient Beauty into the cage of rancor. God shall soon send forth hosts of angels who shall deliver Him through truth and render Him victorious throughout the earth, and His countenance shall shine forth amongst all the worlds. The Youth hath never sought help from anyone, and there is no help save through His command. He aideth whomsoever He willeth by His leave, and He is the One intended from time immemorial, and He is the Helper throughout all eternity.” Infinite tokens of favor have been revealed concerning that leaf of love. God willing, may you be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Beloved and be sanctified and detached from aught else, may you be given to drink of the choice wine of the All-Glorious and be sustained by the eternal bounty, that perchance, through the favors of the All-Glorious Lord, you may be freed from the allusions of these days and find rest and repose in the seat of steadfastness and the station of luminous glory through the love of God. Should someone resolve to journey, God willing, the wondrous and exalted Tablet that was sent down from the heaven of glory shall be dispatched. Blessed art thou for that which hath moved the tongue of thy Lord to mention thy name and for that which thou hast been mentioned before Him, and thou art of those who remember in the presence of transcendent glory. Under all conditions, convey the Command of thy Lord to the handmaidens of God, that they may become aware within themselves and make up for that which hath escaped them. Verily, He is the best of teachers, the All-Knowing. And glory and spiritual delight and praise be upon thee and upon the near-servants of God.</p>

<p>The Wronged One beareth witness to that which God did testify before the creation of all things: that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever existed, sanctified from all peers and likenesses, and exalted above all that hath been said or shall be said. He hath been, and is, the One, the Single, the Unique, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal–He unto Whose oneness and singleness the tongues of all created things have testified, and through Whose remembrance and praise all things have spoken. He Who raised Him up and sent Him forth with the truth is verily the Lamp of Guidance amongst mankind, the Sign of the Ancient of Days amidst the nations, the Dawning-Place of His most beautiful names and the Dayspring of His most exalted attributes–He Who was named Muhammad in the kingdom of creation. God made Him the Source of His Revelation, the Repository of His Knowledge, and the Manifestation of His Laws. Through Him was the Cause of the All-Merciful revealed throughout all possibility, and the Dove of the Command warbled upon the branches. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The Wronged One offereth prayers upon Him and upon His family and companions, through whom the Sun of Knowledge shone forth from the horizon of the world and the Ocean of Bounty surged amongst the peoples. These are honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who act by His command. Through them was made manifest the path of God in all things, and His Word was exalted amongst His servants. Blessed is he who hath clung unto them and attained unto their presence. Upon them be the prayers of God, His mercy, His remembrance and His praise.</p>
<p>And now, We send Our greetings unto the friends of God who have drunk from the pure Salsabil of love and who are turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We counsel all to trustworthiness, religiosity, and chastity. O friends! Whosoever is adorned with these attributes is reckoned among God’s servants and his name is mentioned in the Concourse on High. But whosoever is deprived thereof is not counted among the people of truth. Strive ye, that perchance ye may be adorned with such virtues and qualities as shall ensure eternal salvation. Harm not the fruits of the Tree of Trustworthiness with the stones of treachery, nor scatter its branches with the instruments of tyranny and oppression. The ornament of man hath ever been and shall continue to be truthfulness and sincerity. O friends! Let not the ornaments of two fleeting days, which all testify shall perish, deprive you of the everlasting bounty and the heavenly food sent down. Fix your gaze upon God, place your trust in Him, and seek from Him that which is befitting. It behooveth you to commit all affairs unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Reflect upon the generations of old: Where are the proud and the vainglorious, and where are the workers of iniquity? Ponder their treasures, their palaces, their strongholds and their thrones in former ages, and all that befell them, and take ye warning thereby. This Wronged One beseecheth God that He may assist all to achieve that which is pleasing unto Him.</p>
<p>We convey Our greetings to Sheikh Abul-Qasim. Praise be to God, he has drunk from the chalice of divine knowledge and is gazing toward the most exalted horizon. Under all conditions, hold fast to those matters which lead to the refinement of heedless souls and the liberation of mankind. Verily, Mustafa has arrived and has endured great hardship in transporting the trees. His reward is with God. We convey Our greetings to Akkash and give him glad tidings of Our remembrance of him, for he is forever remembered. Likewise, We have remembered and continue to remember all other friends. Convey greetings from this Wronged One. Verily, He speaks the truth and guides to the path. There is none other God but Him, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beautiful. O Mustafa! Upon thee be My peace. Praise the Desired One of all worlds, Who has bestowed upon thee from the treasury of names a name - that is, thy son - whose worthiness is attested and continues to be attested by people of excellence. We beseech God to assist thee and thy family and those with thee, and to ordain for you the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Lord of all creation. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>O Kalim! Hearken unto the voice of the Ancient Beauty and stand firm in the Cause of God with such steadfastness that the feet of the perturbed ones may be made firm on the Straight Path. Say: O servants! I swear by the Manifestation of Creation and the Sovereign of the Day of Return that what ye have heard from the Mouth of God by His leave, ye shall never hear from anyone else, even should ye traverse forever the wildernesses of vain desires and wander therein. The value of the days of attainment was veiled, for all were soaring in the atmosphere of passion and wandering in the desert of fancy and blindness. When the Kalim of the horizons disappeared from the horizon of Iraq, most turned to the Samiri and that which he fashioned, although We had previously informed all of subsequent events, even as was recorded by the Pen of Power in the Tablets of Migration, and likewise all the events of this land were mentioned in the Tablet that was inscribed by the Finger of Power in Ushshash. Alas for the people of the Bayan! How quickly did they alter the divine favor! I know not in what valley they are wandering.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! Not every bird is capable of soaring in the pleasant atmosphere of the All-Merciful. Let not the divine Cause become dubious to you, for His Cause is distinguished and manifest from all else. Can the cooing of the dove and the tracing of the Most Exalted Pen be confused with the croaking of the raven of the desert? Nay, by the Most High Self of God! Strive that ye may not regard creation as truth, and know Him to be sanctified from all else. The light of day is clearly distinguished from the darkness of night. Set not your hearts on the world, and turn not to the tree of annihilation, for such has been and shall ever be the reality of this world.</p>
<p>Say: O servants! In the days of trial it is beloved to walk in the path of the All-Merciful with the feet of certitude. Otherwise, in the days when the breeze of might wafteth from the Ridvan of the All-Glorious, there shall be many claimants to faith, but such faith hath no merit and dependeth upon another decisive word. In brief, O Kalim, soon thou shalt behold most to be sick, drinking from the cup of hell-fire, and turning away from the Garden of Delight. God willing, thou shalt ever be seen before God as one who drinketh from the Tasnim of eternity and dispenseth it, that perchance mortal frames may drink the Kawthar of divine knowledge from thy loving fingers and, becoming intoxicated, may turn their gaze toward the dwelling-place of “Am I not your Lord?”</p>
<p>O Kalim! Give thanks to God that thou hast been adorned with the ornament of faith and blessed with the new-born child - and this is what We foretold thee aforetime in preserved Tablets of glory. This is one of those tidings that were ordained in the Kingdom of Destiny and were later revealed and made manifest after the completion of its appointed time. Observe the previous Tablets that thou mayest be well informed and be convinced that with Him is the knowledge of all things, and the knowledge which none hath known save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Although thou hast been and, God willing, shall continue to be assured through God’s grace - excellent is that which thou hast entitled and named, and We have accepted what hath proceeded from thee - therefore be thankful and be of the thankful ones. God willing, may you be joyous at all times, and should any sorrow touch you, know with certainty that after it joy is ordained. Indeed, divine bounty towards thee is beyond reckoning.</p>
<p>And if any sorrow should touch you, know with certainty that after it joy is ordained. Indeed, divine bounties bestowed upon you have been limitless and beyond counting, and if in certain matters some deficiency hath appeared, it hath been due to your own negligence in your affairs. And the spirit and glory and splendor be upon you and upon those who are with you and upon those who counsel each other regarding this firm, unshakeable, and mighty Cause.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God! Bear thou witness that there is none other God but Him, and all are prostrate before Him. Put thy trust in God and say: All praise be to God Who hath guided us by His light and made us to be of the doers of good. Be thankful unto thy Lord at all times and say: Glorified be He Who created all things by His command and guided His servants unto a mighty and righteous path. He hath left nothing unmentioned in a perspicuous Book and therein hath He ordained the measures of His decree in wondrous and clear detail. Verily, there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are prostrate before Him. He it is in Whose hand lieth the dominion of all things. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth by His command. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>He hath created the administrators of His Cause in all directions that thereby the affairs of His servants might prosper. Thus do We judge those who have believed and are of the assured ones. Follow thou what hath been sent down in the Book unto thee and follow not the ways of the corrupt ones. Open thine eyes that thou mayest recognize the paths of God in what We have raised up in truth and made to be the path of His Cause in the heavens and on earth, that the proof from thy Lord might be made complete unto all the worlds. Thus hath the command of the servants been decreed and the judgment of the Book been fulfilled, and for all things hath been set forth what was sent down from God upon tablets of manifest glory.</p>
<p>Be patient and grieve not for what hath befallen thee from the vicissitudes of time, and be not of those who turn aside. For this is God’s way with His servants, and thus hath He ordained for those near unto Him. Thereby are the wicked distinguished from the good, and the idolater from the believer, that He might separate between those who believe in God and those who are among the sinners. All that thou hast heard regarding this servant is a lie fabricated by those who have disbelieved in God, rejected His signs, and were among the mischief-makers. I am but a servant of God and the son of His handmaiden, and in this do I glory in the kingdom of the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>Know thou that my station in the realm is as a lamp unto this light, lest it be overwhelmed by the whisperings of the sinners and lest the light of God in the niche of holiness be extinguished by what bloweth from these idolaters. And say thou: O servants! By what proof have ye believed in God and by what authority do ye object to Him? Thus have We tried them with the trial of the Cause and made them an evil people, among the greatest losers.</p>
<p>Sanctify thyself from all that is on earth and glorify thy Lord in the evening and the morning, and be thou of the humble ones. The Cause will be fulfilled, the world will pass away and its possessions will perish, and all that is in it and upon it. All that is on earth shall be gathered together on the Day when all shall stand to account in a mighty and upright presence. There shall every soul find what it hath earned, and God shall question them concerning what they have wrought in the realm. Then shall eyes be fixed in awe of God, and judgment shall be passed in truth according to what is inscribed in a preserved tablet.</p>
<p>Thus have We counselled thee in this Book that thou mightest follow what is revealed unto thee and be not of the transgressors. Take thou this Book with the hands of thy spirit, then cast it upon the vision of thy heart that thou mayest find the fragrance of eternity from the Egypt of the Divine Essence and be of those women who have ascended to the holy retreats and have heard the verses from behind the veils and have drunk the wine of life from the countenance of Beauty from a glorious and luminous cup. There shall thy very frame be sundered in thy longing for thy Creator. Thus do We cast upon thee from the verses of divine attraction […]</p>
<p>They drink the wine of life from the countenance of Beauty, from a cup of resplendent glory. Thereupon thy very being will be rent asunder in thy yearning for thy Creator. Thus do We impart unto thee from the verses of attraction, and make mention of thee with love in the tablets of heaven, and assist thee in the Cause according to that which hath been ordained for thee by God, the Almighty, the Peerless. And peace be upon thee and upon those who have set their faces toward the countenance of thy Lord, the Ever-Living, the Mighty, the Luminous.</p>

Thou art witness and God beareth testimony that this Wronged One hath enjoined the people of God, night and day, through counsels and exhortations, to eschew that which is unworthy and to observe that which is befitting. The ladder of ascension hath ever been and shall continue to be goodly counsel and pure and sanctified deeds. Blessed are they whom wealth and riches have not kept back from the Self-Subsisting. These are the manifestations of detachment and the dawning-places of the fear of God. Upon them rest God’s peace, His grace and His favor.</p>
<p>Thou art well aware of the deeds and doings of this community from times past. After this Wronged One repaired to Iraq, at all times was He engaged in the education of souls. The tongue spoke, the pen flowed, and gesture and sign were employed. In some instances, We illumined and moved creation through speech. At other times We were occupied in assisting the Cause of God through the pen. And occasionally We imparted the water of knowledge through the glance of Our eye and brow. Our purpose was to purify and refine the servants through all Our faculties and members, that perchance unity might be established among the peoples of the world and the fire of love be kindled. Well was it said of old: “Our eyebrows settle matters between us while we remain silent, and love speaketh.”</p>
<p>O Ali, upon thee be God’s grace and favor! In the Most Great Prison thou didst witness how We maintained, with love and fellowship, harmony among the many souls present there, despite their differing views and stations. From the beginning of the world until now, it hath not been heard that any of God’s chosen ones entered prison with such a multitude. Now reflect upon the condition of this Wronged One, how with such love and grace He maintained this gathering, to such degree that most of them in all conditions fixed their gaze upon the horizon of God’s Will.</p>
<p>In the days of Revelation, the people of light and of fire are both present. The people of light are known - “Thou shalt know them by their marks, the radiance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” And the people of fire are those who rejected God’s counsel and manifested rebellion and wickedness, who exchanged trustworthiness for treachery and justice for tyranny. God is witness and aware that We sent away from prison those servants who were uttering calumnies in the great city, solely to protect them, for their deeds had become known and each faced grave danger. We acted with pure grace and love, showing ultimate kindness. Yet those unjust ones did what all know and recognize. Greed and avarice deprived them of the mysteries of the Self-Sufficient Lord.</p>
<p>Now We beseech God to preserve all the friends in every land, that they may ever behold the light of godliness shining before their faces, hold fast unto it, and manifest such deeds and character that their fame may encompass the world, and from every city and region the banner of unity and the standard of accord may be seen. Thy letter arrived and was heard in the presence of this Wronged One. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee! Thou hast spoken that from which the near ones perceive the fragrance of love and fellowship. Thou hast truly shown goodwill. We beseech God to preserve and protect thee through His power.</p>
<p>Indeed thou hast manifested true friendship and sincere affection. We beseech God to protect thee and to guard thee through His power and sovereignty. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Peace be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon every steadfast and unwavering soul.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be the greatness of His station and the glory of His dominion</p>
<p>The remembrance of pen and ink before the writing of letters and words hath been and shall be the mention of the Lord of Creation. Thereafter, O beloved child, Mirza Mustafa, mayest thou always drink from the fountain of the mention of the One Beloved and, through His remembrance, be detached and freed from the world and all that is therein. Thy letter, which testified to thy sincerity and thy love of God, arrived and illumined and gladdened both the heart and the eye. For whatever mention is adorned with the remembrance of the Friend is as a candle in the gathering of the friends. Blessed are those all of whose sayings, thoughts, words, deeds and actions are in this day for the sake of God and for the love of God and in the service of God. O beloved of the heart and soul, ask God the Eternal that we may attain unto that which is worthy and befitting for this day, and that is that we utterly forget ourselves and all else and arise to serve, as with a hundred thousand bodies and a hundred thousand lives. The foremost service is to purify the heart and the eye and the ear and the soul and the entire being from all that is not worthy. Afterwards, when, through the grace of the Ancient and Ever-Living God, one has attained unto this great station, then it is befitting that he should gird up the loins […]</p>
<p>loins of service and stand among the ranks of the servants. O light of mine eyes, the eye of the world is open wide and not a single open eye is to be seen. For that which is meant by openness is to behold and recognize, and that is as rare as the elixir, except among those whom the hand of our Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful, hath seized. O beloved of my soul, I know not whether the pen hath been so inebriated by the love of the King of eternity that it is uttering these words; or whether the writer will quench the fire of regret, at not having attained to that which is worthy in this day, with the water of these utterances. Gracious God, Gracious God! How well hath it been said, “The mention of this remoteness and this bleeding heart, etc.”</p>
<p>To resume, the clothes thou hast asked for have been sent. God willing thou mayest wear them, and outwear them, with happiness, goodness, joy and a good name, and not only this robe, but the robe of the world. O Mustafa, thou wert called by this name by the tongue of the King of Names. This maidservant and that loved one beseech the Incomparable Lord with the utmost lowliness, weakness and supplication, that He may enable you to obtain that which He hath ordained for the pure ones at His threshold. He is the Bounteous, the Generous, the Mighty, the Wise. The maidservant of the wife of Sahib</p>
<p>Now it is the turn of Khadim (servant) to express his love and friendship for that esteemed one. Although thou art seemingly out of sight, but by the Educator of all, thou hast never been and shalt never be absent from the heart. With my whole heart and soul and tongue, I beseech the Lord of the worlds that thou mayest soon attain the court of His holy Presence and drink of the chalice of reunion. Come, come, for the ears have been made receptive for hearing thy tales, and the minds have been made ready ahead of time. However soon thou comest, it is too late, and however close thou comest, it is too far. The one inebriated by the pure Wine sayeth: The time is gone, the opportunity is lost, the year hath passed, the month hath passed, the evening and morning have passed, and yet the time for hearing the word ’Return!” hath not arrived. Alas, alas! and again alas, alas! Therefore I end these words with “There is no power nor strength but in God.” Khadim</p>
<p>He is God, exalted is His glory and mighty is His power.</p>
<p>Before pen and paper mention letters and words, they mention the Lord of Creation, and will continue to do so. And now, dear son Mirza Mustafa, may you ever drink from the Kawthar of the mention of the Peerless Beloved and, in His remembrance, be detached and free from the world and all therein. Your letter, which testified to your sincerity and love for God, arrived and brought joy and light to heart and eyes, for every mention adorned with the remembrance of the Friend is like a candle in the gathering. Blessed are they whose every mention, thought, prayer, deed and action today is for God, for the love of God, and in service to God. O dear one, soul and spirit, beseech the Eternal God that we may attain to that which befits this Day, which is to wholly forget ourselves and others, and arise to serve with a hundred thousand bodies and a hundred thousand souls. The first service is to purify the heart, sight, hearing, inner consciousness and all limbs from that which is unworthy. Then, when through the grace of the Ancient Living One you have attained this mighty station, it is fitting to gird up the loins of service and stand in the ranks of servants. O light of my eyes, the eye of the world is open, yet not one seeing eye is to be found, for the purpose of sight is to see and recognize, and this is like an elixir rarely found, save those whom the hand of our Lord’s grace, the Mighty, the Bestower, has seized. O dear one, I know not whether the pen has been seized by intoxication with love for the Ancient King that it has engaged in these mentions, or whether the writer wishes to soothe with the water of these mentions the fire of regrets of these days for not having attained as befitting. Glory be to God! Glory be to God! Well was it said: “The description of this separation and this heart’s blood…” etc. In any case, the garment you requested has been sent. May you wear it in joy, goodness, delight and good repute, and may you tear not just this one garment but the garment of the world. O Mustafa, you were named with this name by the tongue of the Lord of Names. This handmaiden and that dear one beseech the peerless Lord with utmost humility, powerlessness and supplication to enable you to attain that which He has ordained for the pure ones of His court. Verily He is the Giver, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>The Handmaiden of the Sacred Precincts</p>
<p>Now it is the servant’s turn to express to that master the degrees of love and affection. Though outwardly gone from sight, I swear by the Educator of all that you have never left my heart and never will. With all my heart, soul and tongue I beseech the Lord of all worlds that you may soon attain the station of holy nearness and drink from the cup of reunion. Come, come, for ears are ready to hear your stories and minds are prepared in advance. However soon you come is late, and however early you arrive is far. The one intoxicated with the pure wine says: Time has slipped away, opportunity has slipped away, years have gone and months have gone, nights and mornings have passed, yet the moment to hear the word “Return” has not come. Alas, alas! Then alas, alas! Therefore I end these words with “There is no power nor strength save in God.”</p>

<p>O Rahim! He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!</p>
<p>These are the holy verses sent down from the presence of God, the One, the Single, the Alone, calling the people to the paradise of eternity, the station of My Most Glorious Name in the heaven of thy Lord, the Most High, the Trusted One. Verily, those endowed with illumined vision behold the effulgences of the Countenance from the direction of God, the One, the Single, the Alone, the Self-Subsisting. When the lights of eternity dawned upon them from the horizon of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, they fell prostrate before Him.</p>
<p>O servant! Know thou that thy name hath been mentioned in the holy presence, and We have revealed unto thee decisive verses whereby the eyes of all created things are cleansed from every veil and inflammation. Say: O people! Take hold of the Book of God with strength, cast behind you all that hindereth you from it, and take up your abode in the shade of thy Lord’s mercy, an impregnable station.</p>
<p>O people! Deprive not yourselves of God’s sanctuary, and consort not with those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and are among those who recognized God’s bounty, then denied it. Purify thyself with the living waters flowing from the right hand of the Throne, then seek His grace, for His grace descendeth upon all created things without measure or count.</p>
<p>Grieve not over the world and its hardships, but place thy trust in all matters in thy Lord. Verily, He preserveth whosoever trusteth in Him and seeketh His aid. He will assist thee with the means of the heavens and earth, and will send down from the clouds of grace that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and distance thee from all who deny and deviate.</p>
<p>O servant! If thou desirest to know what hath befallen the Youth, know that He hath been cast into the well of hatred, and there hath befallen Him from oppression that which hath befallen none else among all created things. To this testify all atoms and beyond them the Most Knowing, Most Truthful, Most Witnessing Tongue of God. Say: O people! Ye have committed that which hath caused the pillars of the Cause to crumble, the foundations of the Throne to tremble, the fire above the air to be extinguished, and the water of paradise to freeze.</p>
<p>Say: God is the Creator of all things and is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Soon will He assist whomsoever He pleaseth with the hosts of might and power. There is no helper save Him; He causeth whomsoever He willeth to triumph over whomsoever He pleaseth through assembled hosts.</p>
<p>Know thou that I have fallen into the well of rancor and hatred in this most remote and distant prison, and there befalleth Me at every moment that which none can reckon save God. Would that I had not been born into creation, or had I been born, would that I had not been suckled, or had I been suckled, would that I had not been reared, or had I been reared, would that I had not reached maturity, or had I reached maturity, would that I had not been inspired, or had I been inspired, would that I had not revealed the mysteries through utterance, for thereby have risen against Me all who believed in God, then turned away.</p>
<p>Say: We have spent Our soul and all We possess in the path of God. Once was I slain by the sword of hatred in the time of the First Adam, once was I cast into the fire, once was My head severed upon the platter, once was I crucified upon the cross, once was I suspended in the air, and now have I fallen into the pit of envy. We thank God for all this and for what hath befallen Us, and We praise Him for His decree. Verily, He heareth the cry of those who are in distress.</p>
<p>Thus have We revealed unto thee what hath befallen Us, that thou mayest be apprised of My Cause and remain steadfast upon the path of God, the Mighty, the Extended. And glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among those who have remained firm in their station of certitude in the Cause of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and who are among the people of guidance.</p>

<p>O Mirza Abdul-Karim, upon thee be the Glory of God and His favors!</p>
<p>This binding and irrevocable decree hath at this hour been revealed from the direction of the Most Great Prison. Verily ye were for God, and there is no doubt that He is with you. O Abdul-Karim, upon thee be My Glory and My favors. Thy letter attained the presence of the Wronged One. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath held fast to the cord of patience and acted according to that which was ordained in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thy deeds and thy steadfastness in adversity have brought Me joy. Ye were slain yet did not slay - well is it with you. Ye have done that which hath caused the fragrance of oppression to waft among all created things.</p>
<p>In truth, the glorious government - may God strengthen it - hath manifested justice, and justice is the cause of the elevation, majesty and power of kings. Blessed is he who is adorned therewith, who drinketh from its chalice and is illumined by its effulgences. This party must ever fix their gaze upon this station. God, exalted be His glory, hath ever loved and still loveth faithfulness, and in diverse Tablets hath commanded all to observe it. As to entering beneath its shadow, there is no harm in this for the settlement of affairs and the quelling of the fire of sedition. If they accept, a few will suffice.</p>
<p>This assistance from the glorious government and this manifestation of justice and fairness will, God willing, obliterate the oppression and tyranny of the world. We counsel this party never to forget this justice and to beseech God with all their hearts to perpetuate the traces of the Bearer of the Standard of Justice throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven, for He hath purely for the sake of God assisted the oppressed ones of the world and hath judged with justice. This is the first assistance that hath been manifested toward these oppressed ones through the will of the great Emperor and the noble General - may God, exalted be He, strengthen them both. This station is most great.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest the oppressed ones among the wicked among Thy creation, and Thou witnesseth their sighs and tears in what hath befallen them at the hands of those who have made tyranny their practice in Thy land and oppression their characteristic in dealing with Thy servants. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the sun of Thy grace to aid the oppressed ones to patience and steadfastness in what hath befallen and will befall them in times of hardship and tribulation. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and the manifestations of Thy justice among all humanity to ordain for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen relief from Thee, a helper from Thy presence, and a protector from Thy side to guard them from the evil of their enemies and those who hate them. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>It is most clear and evident that this assistance from the glorious government - may God, exalted be He, strengthen it - is the cause of all hearts turning toward it from all directions.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid him who desireth to help the oppressed ones among Thy servants, then exalt him through Thy bounty, Thy power and Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We wish to seal this Tablet with mention of Fadil, upon him be My Glory and My favors. My Pen and My tongue bear witness to his sincerity, his service, his steadfastness and his presence at this time before the gate of God’s mercy, the Lord of the worlds. The Glory be upon him and upon those who have attained unto justice and fairness and have acted according to that which they were commanded by the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>This is a wondrous remembrance from the servant to him who hath believed in God and was numbered among the guided ones in the Tablets of the Spirit, that He may cause thee to hear the melodies of Paradise and teach thee from the wisdom which God hath treasured in the vaults of knowledge, and bring thee to a station which God hath placed above the pavilions of oneness, and nourish thee with the fruits that have appeared from the Tree of eternity. Thus hath grace been witnessed from the horizon of the Cause.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is the servant of God Who summoneth you unto God and guideth you to the paths of guidance, and imparteth unto you mysteries that were forbidden to the peoples of the world, and causeth the breezes of life to waft upon you, and sendeth forth the fragrant breaths of the All-Merciful from the City which God hath sanctified beyond all knowledge and which hath been veiled from the eyes of the mystics.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear ye God and the Manifestations of His Cause, and let not the world and its ornaments occupy you, for these shall pass away and are accounted before God as but numbered days. Raise your heads from the couches of heedlessness, then detach yourselves from all earthly things, and be not like those who forgot God and cast the words of God behind their backs, and were recorded in the Book of the righteous by the name of transgressors.</p>
<p>These are they upon whose hearts God hath set a seal of fire and upon whose eyes He hath placed a veil of heedlessness, such that they turned away from His beauty in His days and were deprived of the breezes of this Paradise. They occupied themselves with ornate speech as though they had never heard the divine melodies and had not attained unto the mercy that wafted over the bodies of the sinners. Thus doth God seize those who disbelieved and turned away, and forgiveth those who believed and turned towards Him, and will raise them to the station of nearness and cause them to dwell in the proximity of an extended mercy.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God and follow not your desires, then return unto God and follow Him Who calleth you to the truth and inspireth you with the word of righteousness, and aideth you with the hosts of the unseen, and connecteth you to the seats of beloved holiness, and bestoweth upon you everlasting life, and giveth you to drink of the perpetual wine of life, and desireth from you neither recompense nor thanks.</p>
<p>Say: Those who have claimed that these words were not revealed according to pure nature are overcome by their envy, as though they recognized not the holy melodies and tasted not the fruits of Paradise. God hath caused them to be gathered in human form from the clay of beetles. Say: Thus spoke those who disbelieved, uttering words like unto your words, and God seized them for their sins and imprisoned them in the coffin of fire within their own unbelief.</p>
<p>Say: Woe unto you for what your hands have wrought and what your lips have uttered! The Spirit of Oneness beareth witness that all this is truth from God, and the eye of time hath never seen the like of what hath been sent down from His presence. To this testifieth all who are in the heavens and the earth, except those in whose hearts thou findest rancor towards God. Say: Die in your rancor! God will assuredly assist this Cause through the angels of the highest heaven and will raise it to a station that the hands of the hypocrites shall never reach, and this is irrevocably binding upon Him.</p>
<p>And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who worship God in thy land and who stand before Him upon the path of love.</p>

Bear thou witness, O servant, unto that which God hath testified of His Own Self unto His Own Self, that there is none other God but Him, and that the Primal Point is the Glory of God unto all who are in the heavens and the earth, His proof unto all who dwell in the kingdoms of Command and creation, and His evidence unto all who are upon the earth. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all things, turned unto Him, and hearkened unto His melodies which have enraptured the denizens of the most exalted Paradise, then those who dwell in the depths of the Names, then the hearts of every pure soul.</p>
<p>Verily, He is the Hidden Scroll in the unseen realm of the divine cloud, the Treasured Book within the pavilions of the Names, the Tablet of the Spirit in the fields of eternity, and the Scripture of Command in the kingdom of creation. Thus hath the Command been sent down at this hour with truth from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Say: By God! He hath appeared with all the signs, the recognition of which hath proved beyond the capacity of every person of understanding. On His right hand was the Kingdom of God, then on His left the Dominion of Command, and before Him marched the hosts of a wondrous Revelation. Thus were the clouds of idle fancy rent asunder, and God came with the authority of His Cause, while around Him circled the hosts of hidden glory.</p>
<p>Then did they who harbored hatred for this Youth in their hearts deny Him - this Youth at the sight of Whom the eyes of Grandeur were consoled behind pavilions of impregnable glory. They warred against Him, disputed His verses, and denied the grace that encompassed all the worlds. O servant! Cast behind thee all allusions, then burn away the veils of idle fancy through a power from Our presence. Stand firm in the Cause through an authority from Us, and fear no one. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He shall protect thee from every accursed polytheist. Then give thanks unto God within thyself, for the glances of God have been directed toward thee, and the fingers of holiness have moved upon thy name with this Pen which hath been fashioned by God’s handiwork. Through it the knowledge of all things hath appeared, and the knowledge of what was and what will be, and through it the measures of the Cause have been ordained in the heaven of destiny and sent down in a prescribed measure.</p>
<p>Grieve not over this world, but rejoice in the gladness of the Cause. Choose for thyself a praiseworthy station in the shadow of thy Lord’s mercy. Purify thyself from whatsoever hath occurred to thee, and thy breast from the promptings of them who have disbelieved in God and who move about in the wilderness of passion, having deprived themselves of God’s mercy. Be thou at peace within thyself, then stand firm in the Cause, for God hath ordained for thee a station that hath been, in truth, elevated. Soon will He send down upon thee the wonders of His mercy and draw thee nigh unto a luminous station of glory. Know thou that We had previously sent down unto thee a Tablet, and before it another Tablet, and We sent them unto thee as a grace from Us, that thou mightest stand firm in the Cause. And the mercy that descendeth from the heaven of the Cause be upon thee, upon those who love thee in God, and upon every discerning believer.</p>

Exalted is this bounty that hath encompassed existence! And exalted is this generosity that hath embraced all peoples!</p>
<p>O people of God! This Day is the day of supreme steadfastness. The people of Baha are souls who have passed beyond the gulf of names and on the shore of the sea of reality have raised the banner of true unity. Names, like the Shi’ih faction, did not prevent them from the light of oneness. They are attached to and focused on the Truth alone. These are they who are among the companions of the Crimson Ark, whose mention flowed from the Supreme Pen in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’.</p>

Draw nigh and drink thereof in His Name, the One Who rules over all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee in such wise as will draw thee nigh unto God, the Dayspring of lights. When thou perceivest the fragrance of the All-Merciful’s utterance, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy knowledge from the cup of Thy bounty, for having illumined my reality with the light of Thy recognition, and for having made known to me Thy straight and manifest path and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee by the Banner which Thou didst raise by Thy command upon the loftiest spots of Thy earth, and by the Standard which hath been uplifted in Thy Name and speaketh before the faces of Thy creation, to ordain for me that which befitteth the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bounty. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trustees who have sacrificed their wealth and souls in Thy path. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist you and likewise His loved ones to be steadfast, for the Divine Cause in this Revelation is most mighty. Most of those who have turned to it until now are unaware of its essential nature. The Mother Book beareth witness to this in this sublime station. The lights of the Revelation of Him Who conversed with God have encompassed the world, yet eyes are sealed and prevented from beholding. We beseech God to assist all to draw nigh unto Him in all His worlds. Verily He is the Almighty over what He willeth, and He is the All-Bounteous.</p>

I heard Thy call before the creation of Thy heaven and earth, and I answered that verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, possessed of great favor, and verily Thou art the Almighty, possessed of terrible strength and bounty.

Wouldst Thou banish this lowly one who hath hastened to the city of Thy glory? Wouldst Thou deny this thirsty one who hath hurried to the Kawthar of life? O Thou Who hath called Thyself the All-Merciful! Nay, by Thy beauty, O Sovereign of all realms! Thou wilt never deny him, never turn him away. If Thou disappointest me, O my Beloved, I will still call upon Thee, call upon Thee as the All-Bountiful, and if Thou turnest me away, O my Purpose, I will still cry unto Thee, cry unto Thee as the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>At this moment we beseech Thee, by the wafting of the breezes of Thy grace which blow across all regions, and by Thy sovereignty before which all necks have bowed, to send upon Thy loved ones that which will make them sincere toward Thee alone, will enrich them above all else besides Thee, and will sanctify them from all save Thee on this Day which Thou hast specially ordained for the dawning of the Sun of Thy Most Glorious Name upon all things, and which Thou hast chosen for Thy Most Exalted Self betwixt earth and heaven. Then send down upon them what Thou hast ordained for them in the kingdom of Thy decree, strengthen them through Thy might, and exalt them through Thy power over Thine enemies, that Thou mayest cleanse Thy earth of those who have denied Thy Self, rejected Thy proof, and repudiated Thy signs. For verily Thou art the Almighty. In Thy hand is the kingdom of bounty; Thou bestowest upon whom Thou willest as Thou willest, and withholdest from whom Thou willest as Thou pleasest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Conquering, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee on this day, by Thy Most Great Name, O Quickener of nations and Fashioner of mortal remains, to aid us in that which Thou hast commanded us in Thy Scriptures and Tablets, and in walking the paths of Thy good-pleasure. Then enable me, O my God, to assist Thy Cause, to proclaim Thine order, and to spread Thy signs among the peoples, that the standards of Thy guidance may be raised among Thy creatures and the fire of Thy love may be kindled in the hearts of Thy creation. O Quickener of spirits and O Thou in Whose grasp is the direction of the winds!</p>
<p>Then I ask Thee, O my Beloved, by Thy Most Glorious Beauty, to grant us tongues that are eloquent, fluent and clear; eyes that are penetrating, sharp and keen; faces that are illumined and radiant; lips that are smiling and cheerful; ears that are attentive and perceiving; hearts that are sanctified and serene; souls that are purified and well-pleasing; hands that are upraised and outstretched; and feet that are firm, steadfast and upright; and breaths that are influential and pure, that Thou mayest transform all who are on earth entirely through Thy command and will, and draw them near to the shore of Thy Most Great Sea, that all may testify that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the Beloved in the hearts of the lovers, and the One Desired in the hearts of them that long for Thee.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord! Love to his honor Ustad ’Ali-Akbar-i-Banna, may the glory of God rest upon him.</p>
<p>Praise befitteth the Lord of all worlds Who hath ever remembered and continueth to remember His loved ones, and the effulgent rays of His Sun of grace have encompassed all. His is the bounty and the bestowal, His the grace and the exaltation. Blessings and peace be upon His loved ones who have made it their endeavor to serve His Cause, to aid His commandments, to exalt His Word, and to improve whatsoever is associated with His name. He is the Helper in all conditions, for He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of my heart, his honor Afnan - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory - hath written that they have acquired a piece of land in that region dedicated to the name of God, exalted be His glory. After being presented at the Most Holy Court, it was honored with acceptance, and They commanded: “Write to ’Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be My glory, that the construction and development of that place rests with you. This is from God’s grace upon you. We have instructed the Greater Afnan to write to you whatever he deems advisable. This deed shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Well is it with thee, and blessed art thou!”</p>
<p>We extend greetings and salutations to the friends in that land. Make mention of him who shares the name of the Traveler on behalf of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, he hath attained to that which was recorded in the Books and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar! We counsel thee to that which conduceth to unity and concord. Through harmony, the horizons have been illumined by the light of the one true Sun. Should anyone, God forbid, whosoever and wheresoever they may be, utter a word that causeth discord, they are rejected. We have labored intensely until this Cause became somewhat manifest in the cities and lands, its light resplendent and its radiance evident. All must now, with wisdom and utterance, summon the peoples of the world to the horizon of the All-Merciful. The endeavors of the divine men must be directed to this matter. This is the divine counsel that hath been revealed from the luminous Pen in this darksome night. Glory be upon you from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Some time ago, this servant wrote and sent a detailed letter to that beloved one, and likewise the sacred and blessed Tablets requested by you and he who shares the name of the Intended One were dispatched. God willing, their recipients shall drink from the Kawthar of inner meanings concealed within the divine words and become detached from all else but God. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you in God’s Cause, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>O Ali-Qabl-Akbar, upon thee be my Baha! In the name of the All-Knowing Speaker.</p>
<p>Thy letter was sent to the Most Holy Court by Ismi Mahdi, upon him be my grace and mercy. Blessed art thou for having sent that which bore the fragrance of My martyrs who cast aside all else but Me and sacrificed their spirits, bodies, frames and possessions in My path. By God’s life! The Mother Book in the Supreme Realm lamented their tribulation, and the wailing of the Most Great Name was raised among the nations. By My life! My Pen hath wept and My ink hath cried out. The world hath never witnessed the like of those assured and detached souls.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-Akbar! In these days and nights, without cessation, their praise and glorification ascendeth from the seat of the Throne. The Concourse on High uttereth this most exalted word: “Would that we had been with them and attained that which none among the servants hath attained!” Blessed are they and joy be unto them, for they have truly seized the ball of supreme felicity. Through the light of their sacrifice, the horizons were illumined. Soon shall the fruits of their martyrdom appear in the earth. Verily, God is the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>The station of martyrdom that was attained is most great, and this precious pearl is not always to be found. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who attained unto it. No deed greater than this hath ever been witnessed in the world - the patience and fortitude of those holy souls. Yet most of the servants know not the cause and reason for this patience, for they are heedless and are seen to be far removed from the ocean of knowledge and the sea of wisdom.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-Akbar! Those mighty, conquering and powerful hands were bound by the divine chains of restraint and were firmly secured by the fetters of God’s commandments and laws. Blessed and happy are they! They have been gazing toward the purpose of the worlds. Therefore they held fast unto that which was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. However, the authorities and the oppressors of the day were and are heedless of understanding the cause and reason. Strange it is that even His Majesty the Sultan is unaware of the cause. For were he to become aware, he would arise in praise and gratitude to the Dawning-Place of verses and the Dayspring of evidences. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this exalted and glorious station.</p>
<p>Convey greetings and glory from this Wronged One to the friends in that land. Blessed are those souls who have annihilated their will and desire in the Will and Desire of God, and who have had and have no will of their own. These are the people of Baha. Their names have been recorded in a Tablet which none hath seen save God, the Speaker, the Truthful, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon My loved ones who have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of My bounty and have said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne!”</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory! Wisdom and utterance.</p>
<p>According to the Command, those beloved ones and chosen ones must act in whatever way brings joy and gladness to the designated just government. All must be oriented towards goodly deeds. Teaching in that land must not extend beyond Muslims, and even then only if they are from Iran, meaning subjects of the Iranian government. It must not go beyond matters of character and that which leads to the elevation and advancement of stations. In truth, your deeds are the cause of the awakening of souls. If they are not aware now, they will surely acknowledge it later.</p>
<p>Another matter that must be considered is that copies of the Tablets sent, as well as the letter specifically dispatched to the maternal uncle, should not go to Iran, for the oppressors of the world secretly harass the oppressed. They know and recognize the divines of Iran.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of oaths - excellent is what you have said and done. In truth, oaths are not acceptable. That which has repeatedly been revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Tablets was intended to exalt the Word, so that it might draw the attention of the hearer and then convey that which causes elevation and ascendancy. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak before and at this time.</p>
<p>The actions of the glorious government in this matter have been for the sake of God. For one thousand three hundred years, the people of Iran have been occupied with cursing certain servants, reviling some among the people of various lands, and awaiting the appearance of imaginary forms. And when the Divine Tree grew and the Light shone forth, they busied themselves with cutting it down and extinguishing it. This supreme grace was bestowed upon the glorious government, which has surpassed the kings of the world in assisting the oppressed. We beseech God to strengthen it, preserve it, and ordain for it what He willeth. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>Read the sacred Tablet that was revealed in the name of Husayn and keep it concealed from the people of hypocrisy. And if a time comes when it is appropriate, with regard to proving loyalty, mention its contents to those princes who have specifically manifested assistance and the appearance of justice and fairness in that land. This is beloved before God, for it is incumbent upon all to preserve the right of the Helper and the station of the Trustworthy One, and to show gratitude. God willing, that which occurred in the beginning and was hidden in the soil of hearts will, through the waters of divine will and the rains of the All-Merciful’s grace, bring forth therefrom refined, wondrous and sublime fruits. The Command is in the hand of the Planter and the Cultivator, and He is God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>The appointed time hath come, and from the heaven of God’s command hath appeared the House of Revelation with a might that the malice of the wicked cannot weaken - they who have violated God’s Covenant and Testament, and slain His loved ones without clear proof from Him or authority from His presence. We testify that they have wrought corruption in the land after its reformation, and rejected the blessing of tranquility after it had been established and spread through the justice of the Sovereign of the Kingdom and its Authority. Thus doth the Wronged One speak as He walketh in this place which hath been named the Most Great Prison in the world - a place cut off from the mention of all peoples. Blessed is he who hath heard what he was commanded by God, the Cleaver of Dawn.</p>
<p>We have forbidden all from corruption and commanded them to righteousness and godliness, yet the heedless have cast behind their backs that which would profit them and have followed rebellion and wickedness. Lo! They are among the lost in the sight of their Lord, the Most High. They have slain him who believed in God, aided His Cause, and spoke His praise by night and by day.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Thy letter which thou didst send to one of the Afnan hath brought Us joy, and We found from it the fragrance of unity in days wherein people have differed regarding the News foretold by Moses in the Torah and the Beloved One in the Qur’an. We have mentioned thee time and again, and have revealed for thee that whereby all things were stirred and minds and spirits were attracted. Stand firm in aiding the Cause of thy Lord through the wisdom whose sun hath shone forth from the horizons of the Sacred Scriptures and Tablets. Thou hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. He hath aided thee to serve His Cause and hath shown thee the paths of guidance.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was martyred in the path of God and say: The first effulgence hath appeared from the horizon of the heaven of grace and bounty upon thee, O thou who wast named Muhammad-Rida! I testify that thou didst believe in the All-Merciful when the ocean of divine knowledge surged in the contingent world, and thou didst answer the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven, and thou didst drink the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Possessor of the Kingdom of Names. Thou art he whom neither the veils of the oppressors nor the allusions of the transgressors prevented, and who forsook the religion of people who wrought corruption in the earth after its reformation and denied God’s favor after its descent. The Spirit be upon thee, O thou at whose calamity the near ones lamented and the sincere ones cried out! Blessed art thou and blessed is he who visiteth thee and reciteth what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in this Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Luminous, Most Glorious Spot.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness! Remember My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of God’s mercy, His grace and His loving-kindness. We counsel them to fellowship and unity. We beseech God to aid thee in improving their condition in all circumstances. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>The lamentation of God hath verily been raised in truth from the Manifestation of His Self, Who hath fallen prey to the talons of hatred, with none to help Him except God Who created Him, raised Him up in truth, and sent Him unto all the worlds. By God! There hath befallen Him that which hath caused the hearts of them that are nigh unto God to be consumed in the most exalted chambers, and the hearts of the sanctified ones in the crimson pavilions, and the hearts of the unitarians in the cities of names, and none hath comprehended this save Mine all-knowing and all-wise Self.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord with the ear of thine inmost nature, then turn thy face toward the precincts of the House, this Sanctuary which God hath built with the hands of His power and made it an ornament of His Self between the heavens and the earths. Say: O people! Destroy not the sanctuary of God with hands of rancor and hatred. If ye turn not unto it, oppose it not, for whoso opposeth it shall soon be seized by the chastisement of a barren day.</p>
<p>O people! Dispute not concerning the Cause of God, nor reject what He hath brought in truth, nor deny the grace of Him Who hath encompassed all created things, if ye be of them that know. Remember God in the watches of the night and at the ends of the day, for His remembrance cannot be realized except through this most sublime and mighty Remembrance. Whoso turneth away from this Remembrance hath indeed turned away from all remembrance throughout all ages. Thus hath the matter been ordained in preserved tablets of holiness.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Be thou guided by the guidance of God, thy Lord, and turn not unto anyone. Place thy trust in Him in all matters, for He is the best of helpers and protectors. Then rejoice within thyself that thy father hath attained unto the presence of God and his spirit hath ascended to a station whereof the knowledge of the knowers is cut off. The maidens of Paradise shall now serve him and the denizens of the Supreme Concourse shall find solace in his company. Walk thou in the footsteps of thy father and be steadfast in the path of God in such wise that thy feet shall not slip through the insinuations of the opposers.</p>
<p>Say: O my Lord! All praise be unto Thee for having made me recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self and cast into my heart the lights of love and sent unto me a Book of glory most bountiful. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for this great bounty and mighty gift. I beseech Thee, O my God, not to leave me to myself, then preserve me from the evil of Satan and his hosts, and send down upon me that which will sever me from all else save Thee and render me independent of all except Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest, and Thou hast power over all things.</p>
<p>Thus have We remembered thee and commanded thee, that thou mayest recite the verses of thy Lord and be of them that remember. And may the light that hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, that thou mayest be of the people of Baha and be of the assured ones.</p>

<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Him Whom Thou hast manifested and made His Revelation the very Revelation of Thyself, and His concealment the very concealment of Thyself; and through His primacy Thou hast confirmed Thine own primacy, and through His finality Thou hast established Thine own finality; and through His power and dominion every possessor of power hath testified to Thy power, and through His grandeur every possessor of grandeur hath testified to Thy grandeur and Thy majesty; and through His self-subsistence Thy self-subsistence and all-encompassing nature have become known; and through His Will Thy Will hath been manifested; and through His countenance Thy Face hath shone forth; and through His command Thy Command hath become manifest; and through His signs the horizons have been filled with the wondrous signs of Thy sovereignty, and the heaven with the revelations of the glory of Thy unity, and the seas with the pearls of the sanctity of Thy knowledge and wisdom; and the trees have been adorned with the fruits of Thy knowledge; and through Him all things have glorified Thee, and all things have turned toward the court of Thy mercy, and all faces have turned to the splendors of the light of Thy countenance, and all souls to the manifestations of the glory of Thy oneness.</p>
<p>How transcendent is Thy power, how transcendent Thy sovereignty, how transcendent Thy might, how transcendent Thy greatness, how transcendent Thy majesty which was manifested through Him and which Thou didst bestow upon Him through Thy bounty and generosity! I testify, O my God, that through Him Thy most great signs appeared and Thy mercy preceded all things. Were it not for Him, the Dove would not have cooed, nor would the Nightingale of Praise have warbled in the heaven of destiny. And I testify that with the first word that proceeded from His mouth and the first call that was raised by Him through Thy Will and Purpose, all things were transformed–the heaven and all that is therein, and the earth and all that is thereon. Through it the realities of existence were transformed, separated, divided, distinguished, joined together and unified. Through it appeared the creative words in the world of dominion and kingdom, and the manifestations of unity in the world of might, and the signs of oneness in the realm of divinity. Through that call the servants were given the glad-tidings of Thy most great Revelation and Thy most perfect Command.</p>
<p>When He appeared, the nations were thrown into confusion, upheaval appeared in earth and heaven, the pillars of all things were shaken. Through Him appeared the great tribulation and the Most Great Word was differentiated, whereby appeared the distinction between every atom of all created things. Through it was the Fire kindled and Paradise made manifest. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Thee, and woe unto him who hath turned away from Thee and denied Thee and Thy signs in this Revelation wherein the faces of the idolaters were darkened and the faces of the sincere were illumined.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, by this Revelation, to ordain for us the good of this world and the world to come, and to send down upon us from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will render us independent of all except Thee and detached from all save Thyself, holding fast unto the cord of Thy loving care and clinging to the hem of Thy tender mercies. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>He bears witness, this most abject atom, before the radiance of Thy Ancient Beauty, and in this darkest night facing the effulgence of the countenance of the Sovereign Lord of Thy Oneness, that there is for Thee no manifestation or concealment whereby I might describe Thy boundless favors. How then can I venture before the countenance of the King of Thy Attraction, and with what tongue can I chant in praise of the verses of the glory of Thy sanctified majesty, and with what existence can I seclude myself in the cloud of Thy oneness, and with what utterance can I call to mind the letters of Thy sovereignty, after I see myself as naught that I might stand in the arenas of the patient ones, and find in myself no existence that I might take my place in the court of the yearning ones? Yet, O my Beloved and my Desire, I am not perplexed save by the movement of the cords of Thy loving-kindness, and I ascend not save through the atmosphere of intimacy with the presence of the Sovereign Lord of Thy Self-Subsistence, and I rise not save to the heaven of Thy holy love. I venture forth in the court of Thy glorious bounty, and with plaintive, tender cry I call upon Thee in the inner mysteries of Thy most holy Essence, and I submit that O my Splendor, my Remembrance and my Hope, pour forth upon Thy loved ones from the drops of Thy holy camphor and from the waves of Thy seas of intimacy, that perchance their hearts may find rest like unto Mount Encompassing before the manifestation of Thy Ancient Beauty, and their inner beings may be cooled like unto snow amidst the surging of the seas of the Sovereign Lord of Thy Uniqueness, that they might become radiant through the radiance of the beauty of the Presence of Thy Divinity, and shine forth through the effulgence of the countenance of the Sovereign Lord of Thy Grace, and become detached from all else through the appearance of the countenance of Thy attraction, and stand firm in the establishment of Thy Cause, and find delight in the remembrance of the letters of Thy sovereignty, and speak with Thy utterance before Thee, and journey toward the heaven of infinitude through Thy power, and find tranquility through Thy peace, and do Thou teach them a drop from the drops of knowledge hidden within the treasuries of Thy might, and show them a wave from the waves of that beloved state which lies concealed in the inner mysteries of Thy clemency. Alas, alas! Then alas, alas! God is Most Great! God is Most Great! God is Most Great! The tempest of divine jealousy has begun to blow and the Dove of Independence has taken wing, while all the companions have grown cold and remain veiled, whence they perceive not.

It reached thee not, for God hath appointed a time for all things in His knowledge, and verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. Therefore have We now sent it unto thee that thou mayest inhale therefrom the sweet fragrances of holiness and delight in the blessing wherewith none among all the peoples of the world hath been favored. Within it are the mysteries of what hath been and what shall be, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness. Share thou it with them that have believed in God and His signs, that haply the servants may attain unto the stations of His Cause and be numbered among them that know, though these people can scarce comprehend a word of that which hath been sent down from the Pen of God, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Among them are those who believed in God and then turned away, and were counted among the idolaters; and among them are those who follow their idle fancies and turn not toward the Throne, and are numbered among the prodigal; and among them are those who wish not to hear a single word save what they have heard from their fathers and mothers - thus mayest thou know the nature of the deniers. With them is naught save what the people of the Furqan have deduced, and thus have We recorded the matter in a clear register. Among them are those who ask of the drop concerning the ocean, its waves and its depths. Say: Woe unto you, O heedless ones! And among them are those who ask of the atom concerning the sun, its radiance, its light and its splendor - thus mayest thou know the state of these hateful ones. Purify thou thy heart from them, from their mention, their names, and from all that pertaineth unto them, and take thy stand in a pure and mighty sanctuary. Though thou must associate with such as these outwardly, be thou inwardly opposed to their desires and dwell in solitary dignity, for such as these are like unto dust, and thy Lord loveth to cleanse thy robe from this thick and heavy cloud of dust. Then act thou according to what We have commanded thee at the end of the Holy Tablet, and be thou possessed of manifest power. Beware lest thou see in thy power aught save the power of thy Lord, or in thy traces aught save the traces of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Invincible. Thus have We rained down upon thee from the clouds of holiness that wherewith the hearts of them that are nigh unto God are refreshed.

<p>O people of Baha! The sun of justice was indeed concealed and veiled beneath the clouds of oppression, but God hath assisted His Majesty the illustrious Russian State to cause its shining forth and appearance, and its deliverance from every thick veil and mighty cloud. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist him and his friends and princes through whom the standard of victory was raised there and the flag of triumph was unfurled before the faces of mankind, in spite of those who imprisoned justice and equity and prevented their shining forth, their light and their manifestation, that He may deliver the oppressed through the arms of justice and equity, even as He delivered them and saved them from the oppressors, the transgressors and the deniers. Thus hath the matter been decreed from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hear thou the call of the Wronged One: All the friends must, from this Thursday, the 2nd of Jamadiyu’th-Thani 1307, until the endless end, recognize the worth of the benevolence of the illustrious State–may God assist it–and arise to do that which beseemeth this justice. Those souls who, without any veil or covering, supported and assisted justice, and aided and delivered this imprisoned Wronged One from the dark pit through the strong cord of equity, are deserving of a mighty recompense from God–exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty. The Wronged One testifieth that they are the ones who aided the servants of God and secured the rights of the oppressed from every obstinate oppressor and suspicious transgressor. God willing, may the friends be assisted throughout ages and centuries to reciprocate this supreme benevolence which hath been manifested from the blessed and just State. Glory and light and majesty and praise be upon His Majesty and upon those who ruled on his behalf with pure justice and restrained the oppressors from their oppression and seized them with the grip of one mighty and powerful.</p>

This is the Cause at which every possessor of praiseworthy understanding is thunderstruck, at which all in the heavens and earth are shaken, at which the pillars crumble and covenants are broken - save for those who have clung to the cord of God. Let nothing grieve thee save separation from Me, the Inaccessible, the Forbidden, and complain thou of naught save thy remoteness from My presence, for this is the root of sorrow, which none save those nigh unto God can comprehend. Yet be thou patient in this, then show forth consummate patience as We have commanded thee. Transgress not that which thou art bidden, and be not of those who overstep the bounds of God and His good-pleasure - such as these know nothing and perceive not.</p>

Hearken with thy heart’s ear unto the call of Ali in truth, then unto the call of Muhammad, then unto the call of the Spirit from the precincts of the Prison, that there is none other God but He, and that He Who hath appeared in truth is, verily, His sovereignty, His might and His grandeur unto all who dwell in the unseen and the visible realms.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! Know thou that God hath heard thy call and hath become aware of how His love hath consumed thee, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in the sacred Scrolls and Books. Rejoice in that thou hast been given to drink from the cup of everlasting life and hast attained unto that which they who have wound their heads in white cotton to display their learning have failed to attain, and who remained heedless of the Day wherein the Sun of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>By God! A single step taken by one of My handmaidens is better than the deeds of those who have denied God, even should they be among the great ones of the earth. Thus hath the command been sent down with sovereignty and power. Know thou that knowledge is the recognition of God, and when thou hast recognized Him, thou art better in the sight of thy Lord than the learned ones of the age. Therefore give thanks and bow down before the countenance of God, Who hath caused the night to be followed by day.</p>
<p>In every moment, taste the holy water of nearness from the fingers of divine companionship, then turn away from every prideful oppressor. They who have denied God after He appeared in truth are among the most evil of men, and have no station with thy Lord - these are the companions of the fire.</p>
<p>We have been with thee in thy rising up and thy sitting down, and in thy migration unto God, and We have accepted thy deeds and have ordained for thee in the heaven of Our command a station which none can comprehend save them who are endued with insight.

He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth.</p>
<p>Purify thy heart from the world and its mention, then remember thy Lord at eventide and at dawn, and in every morning and evening. For the world and whatsoever is therein and thereon shall perish, and that which endureth is that which is with thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Forget every mention and find solace in the Most Great Remembrance. He is the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>Detach thyself from all else but God, thy Lord, then turn thy face toward the sanctuary of His love and good-pleasure, and be of them that are detached. We beseech God to heal thee and cure thee of thy ailment and illness. Verily, He is the Answerer of the prayers of the suppliants. When the appointed time cometh, He will cause the rains of mercy and healing to descend upon thee from the clouds of His grace. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>Beware, beware lest thou be impatient. Be thou patient and hold fast unto God’s cord in these days wherein most of the servants have become heedless of the remembrance of their Lord and are numbered among the negligent. Their only concern in this world is to amass its ornaments unto themselves, and thus do they cast themselves into grave peril. Keep thyself away from such as these, for God shall soon return them to dust, and they shall be in manifest loss.</p>
<p>Peace be upon him who followeth guidance and is firm in certain truth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down in truth, wherein is that which draweth the world nigh unto the Most Great Name and causeth them to hear the Call of God, the King, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. All awaited the days of nearness and meeting, but when the gate of reunion was opened they turned away, following the desires of the doubtful ones. They cast the ocean of certitude behind their backs, turning instead to the streams of fancy and vain imaginings - these are among the bewildered ones. They denied God and His evidence, hastening in the wilderness of passion while supposing themselves to be among the guided ones. Nay, by His Command which overshadoweth the worlds! The world hath been stirred by the breezes of Revelation, yet they remain behind an evident veil. Say: He hath appeared according to His Will, not your desires. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.</p>
<p>When the Proof came, they denied Him, and when the Way appeared, they turned from it and spoke that which caused the hearts of them that are nigh to burn. Behold and remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came - the people turned away from Him, following every remote idolater. No Luminary appeared to them but they denied Him and spoke concerning Him that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having discovered the fragrance of the Garment and turned toward God, the Lord of all worlds. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to rend the greatest veil, and for causing thee to hear His Call from the direction of His most luminous manifestation, and for having brought thee nigh unto this Sea which none have attained save whom God, the Almighty, the Powerful, hath willed.</p>
<p>Be thou a herald amongst the servants in the name of thy Lord, the Creator of all things. Then remind them with this wondrous Remembrance. Say: O people! Abandon your desires and turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon. This is what ye have been commanded in a Preserved Tablet. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the breezes of the days of God or follow every dubious caviller. Say: By God! Did ye but know what hath appeared in creation, ye would sacrifice yourselves in this Straight Path. Say: This is a Day wherein nothing shall profit you, even if ye should cling to all the Books. The Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty beareth witness to this, were ye of them that perceive.</p>
<p>Thus have We set forth the verses and sent them unto thee as a grace from Our presence, that thou mayest remind the people of this Announcement whereby the faces of the sincere ones have been illumined. We beseech God to assist thee in the service of His Cause and to ordain for thee that which He hath ordained for them that have soared in the atmosphere of nearness and reunion. Verily, He is the Beneficent, the Generous.</p>

<p>God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with proof and evidence is verily the Dawning-Place of God’s revelation, the Dayspring of His Cause, the Source of His wisdom, and the Repository of His knowledge, Who hath [stood] in His Own place in the human kingdom amongst all peoples. Whoso holdeth fast unto Him is among the choicest of all creation before Him, and whoso hesitateth is accounted among the oppressors in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Day hath come while the people remain in evident delusion. That which was hidden from sight hath appeared, and that which was treasured in the heaven of knowledge hath been sent down. Through it the trees have yielded their fruits, the rivers have flowed, the mysteries have been unveiled, and the nightingale of utterance hath warbled upon the highest branches. [By God!] He Who was treasured from time immemorial hath appeared, and He Whose advent was heralded in God’s Books, the Mighty, the All-Praised, hath risen.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Repeatedly hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and thou hast been favored with grace. Know thou the station of this station, then preserve it through the name of thy Lord, the Preserver, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! In the great city the fire of hatred, treachery, calumny, greed, tyranny and corruption blazeth bright.

Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Pen! Thou hast mentioned him who loved Thee. Make mention of him who drank the wine of martyrdom from the hands of submission and contentment, and repaired to the Most Exalted Paradise by the command of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: May the first fragrance that wafted from the garment of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, be upon thee, O fruit of the Tree of bounty, O pillar of faithfulness in the kingdom of names, O word of the Book of God, Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below. Thou art he whom neither commerce nor trade deterred from the remembrance of God. I beseech God by thee and by those who loved thee to open before the faces of His servants the gates of justice and fairness, and to send down upon them from the heaven of His bounty the rain of His mercy and His gifts.

My proof hath been My manifestations of power that have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, and I have made verses the path to My knowledge as a grace from Us to all the worlds. And since My previous Manifestation designated verses as the proof of this most mighty, most holy and most glorious Manifestation, We have therefore caused verses to be sent down from the heaven of Will and have established them as proof for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Until this Manifestation, verses alone have been proof for all, for We had sent down this decree in all previous Books. Although in this Manifestation all signs of power, manifest proofs, wondrous verses, glorious manifestations and divine attributes have appeared - and all this as a grace from Us to all created things - yet henceforth the matter resteth in God’s hands, that He may designate what shall be proof for future Manifestations. We shall soon send down His decree in the Tablets, for verily We have ever been the Ruler over all things. All matters are within Our mighty grasp; We do what We will and decree what We please. For in this Manifestation God, exalted be His mention, hath willed that many of the sincere seekers should speak in verses. Therefore We shall, by His command and His will, ordain what shall constitute proof of the next Manifestation, lest anyone who produceth words should exalt himself over God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Almighty - even as did he whom We caused to speak at a level far below that of the servants who circle round My throne, yet who exalted himself over God Who created him, nurtured him, preserved him from the harm of his enemies, and protected him beneath the wing of His wondrous and ancient grace. Thus have We decreed on this night, and We decree what We will by Our command, for verily I am the Almighty over what I will, and all else besides Me are My creation. O My creation!

O servant! Hearken unto the call of this servant who weepeth and lamenteth by reason of what hath befallen him, and who, at all times, crieth out between earth and heaven: “O people! Fear ye God, and make not His signs an object of mockery amongst yourselves. Be ye afraid of God, and commit not that which ye have been forbidden in the Book. Then follow ye the truth in accordance with what hath been detailed by the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.” O servant! By God! Were there to descend upon thee what hath descended upon Us, thou wouldst detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and wouldst smite thy head, and lament at morn and eventide. Arise to serve God and aid His Cause, then convey unto the people that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Spirit - the Sun of grandeur and power - with a sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. Then remind those who have believed in that place, that perchance they may detach themselves from whatsoever they possess and turn towards a station which hath been illumined by the truth. Say: By God, O people! Nothing of what hath been created between the heavens and the earth shall profit you, and that which shall profit you is with God, your Creator. Hasten ye therefore unto Him with your hearts, that ye may find a way unto Him. God shall soon change the earth and whatsoever is upon it, and shall gather together all creatures at a station which hath been irrevocably decreed by the Pen of Destiny from time immemorial. They shall be questioned concerning what they have wrought in their vain life, and shall be rewarded according to their deeds. Thus hath the matter been sent down in truth from the heaven of holiness. And thou, O servant, forget all else save God, thy Lord, then take comfort in that which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Sinai and hath been manifested in truth through a Command at which all in the kingdom were thunderstruck, except a number of the Manifestations of Our most beautiful Names, who were at that time soaring on the wings of detachment in the atmosphere of the Spirit. Thus have We cast upon thee the Word of Truth, that thou mayest follow what thou hast been commanded in the Tablet and be of those who are well-pleasing unto God.

Know thou that I have perceived the fragrance of thy heart in thy love for thy Creator and have heard the cry of thy soul in thy following of thy Lord. It is as though I have numbered the secrets of thy heart from thy public and private utterances, and have grieved over thy state in such wise as none can reckon save God, my Lord and thy Lord. Yet I counsel thee not to grieve over what hath befallen thee of hardships from the vicissitudes of the world, for if time had any worth the people of eternity would not have forsaken it, nor would the possessors of understanding complain of it in the dominion of the heavens. For by God, besides Whom there is none other God, this world and its ornaments and its glory and its people and all that thou beholdest therein are but as a fleeting shadow upon the earth, nay less than that, insomuch that in the sight of the dwellers of the heights and those who recline upon the cushions of recognition, it is not worthy of mention nor counted as existing.</p>
<p>Hearken thou unto My words: Fasten the cord of thy love to the sure handle and secure the rope of thy affection to the exalted pavilion, that thou mayest find the fragrance of eternity from the sanctuary of faithfulness and witness thyself turning toward the sanctuary of Beauty in the Kaaba of Glory through the orientation of thy heart unto God thy Creator. Then shall no distress overtake thee, nor shall any weariness touch thee, neither from hardship nor from adversity. Rather, these shall circle round about thee and serve thee in thy love for thy Creator. Well is it with thee shouldst thou drink from these waters, from this ocean which hath flowed forth at this time from the crimson cloud, for thou shalt find what none among the worlds hath found. Therefore give thanks for the doors of inner meanings having been opened unto thee and the divine fragrance having wafted upon thee from this ancient scroll, that thou mayest follow thy Eternal Beloved in the garments of the Everlasting One and taste of the divine table in what hath been sent down unto thee from the Pen of Light upon this white tablet.

<p>O Haydar, upon thee be My Baha! A letter from the honored Sayyah hath reached this Servant wherein he hath expressed his repudiation of former statements. An answer was written and sent to him. We beseech God to purify him from the thoughts of every corrupt traitor and every tyrannical deceiver. Despite that person’s claim to assist the oppressed, when his corrupt intention was not accepted, he arose in wrath and martyred His Holiness Ashraf. By the life of God! Even if the entire world should rise up to harm this Wronged One, He hath not and will not collaborate with the corrupt. Glory be to God! From the cruelty of that infernal tree, that honored one knew and knoweth his thoughts. Say: We have said before, “My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor do I walk in your ways.” From any matter or deed from which the fragrance of corruption, conflict and contention can be detected, the people of Baha are sanctified, holy and pure therefrom. One who intendeth harm against his father and brother will surely show no fidelity to others. His denial of the Wronged One caused his selfish promptings to rise in enmity, and the fire of hatred was kindled in his heart. In the presence of Sayyah We said that such souls have not had and do not have faithfulness. Trust not in him. Purify the hem of thy heart from his evil deeds, thoughts and intentions, and place thy trust in God. Verily, He provideth for whomsoever He willeth without measure. In any case, according to what he hath written, by God’s grace and favor he hath now freed and liberated himself from the ocean of oppression and corruption. Therefore We seek his contentment, that he be not troubled, for from the beginning of days he had shown love towards Us. We have loved and continue to love faithfulness. We beseech God to assist him to serve the Cause with wisdom and utterance, to make him sincere for His sake, and to cause him to hold fast to His cord. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God! We are Thy servants and in Thy grasp. We desire naught but what Thou hast desired through Thy Will, and we wish for naught save what Thou hast wished through Thy power and sovereignty and ordained in the Tablet of Thy decree by the Pen of Thy determination. O Lord! We bear witness, and those who uphold the throne of Thy grandeur, and the dwellers of the pavilion of Thy glory, and all created things besides, that we have acknowledged Thy oneness and been assured of Thy unity and submitted to what Thou hast sent down upon Thy Prophets and Messengers and upon Him Whom Thou hast made the Seal of Thy chosen ones and made Him a bearer of glad tidings to those of Thy creation who are on the right hand and a warner to those who are on the left hand among the rebellious of Thy creatures. Nothing hath appeared from us in Thy kingdom that would be contrary to Thy laws and ordinances. I beseech Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy Most Beautiful Names and Thy Most Exalted Attributes, to make this Prison blessed for us, and make it a remembrance for Thy servants and a sign for Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the One with power over what Thou willest. O Lord! Thou knowest that we love what Thou hast ordained for us and desire naught except what Thou hast willed through Thy command. We know not what lieth with Thee. If Thou hast decreed our release from this Prison, deliver us from it through Thy power and sovereignty, and manifest what is in our hearts before Thy servants that they may know that we desire none other than Thee and have chosen naught for ourselves save Thy love and good-pleasure, and that we were not corrupting Thy realm but desired to journey through Thy lands and visit Thy Sacred House and stand at the Sacred Monument and Station. I beseech Thee by the flame in the hearts of them that are one in their love for Thee and by the burning of the sincere ones in their passion for Thee to ordain for us what is best for us and gather us with Thy loved ones in the paradise of Thy mighty oneness and the carpet of Thy holy mercy. Thou art our Purpose and our Object of worship. Through Thee we have become independent of all else, and through Thy grace we have detached ourselves from the worlds. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, and verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>

We have created the world for My manifestation and the recognition of My Self, yet the people have turned away from Me save those whom We have delivered through a mercy from Our presence - and I am, verily, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>This is a city that was once the most desolate of lands. God hath adorned it with this Name through which the Ancient Beauty was established upon the Most Great Throne and the mention of God was exalted between the heavens and the earth. Verily, He abases whomsoever He willeth through His command, and elevates whomsoever He desireth through His sovereignty that prevails over the worlds.</p>
<p>God hath made this city the mother of cities in these regions by virtue of the dawning of the Sun of Manifestation from its horizon with this perspicuous Name. Blessed art thou and blessed is she who hath ascended unto God. Verily, she is in the highest horizon. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Grieve thou not over anything. Place thy trust in God. Soon shall pass away all that thou seest, and there shall endure that which hath been ordained for you in My glorious and exalted Kingdom.</p>

We have, in truth, made mention of him that he may rejoice in My remembrance of him and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Ye are among the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree, and God maketh mention of you through His grace. He is, verily, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Beware lest the clamor of those who have disbelieved should veil you, or the conditions of the heedless should cause you grief. Hold fast unto the sure handle, then do that which ye have been commanded in the Tablets of your Lord. He hath detailed in the Book that which shall profit you.

<p>O Majid! With My own hands have I reared thee, and in My exalted Paradise have I planted thee, that through My loving care thou mightest bring forth goodly branches, pure boughs, and blessed fruits. And now is the time of thy fruition. Beware lest thou suffer thy leaves, fruits and branches to be withered by the scorching winds of extinction or be brought to naught. Therefore, through remembrance of My glorious Name, keep fresh the fruits of thine own tree and preserve them from violent gales and destroying tempests.</p>
<p>O Majid! Consort not with Mine enemies, nor turn thy attention unto them, save when thou arisest to champion My Cause. O Majid! Face to face have I breathed into thee of My holy fragrances, and from the narrow wilderness of death have I drawn thee to the pleasant expanse of life, and by My purifying hand of power have I delivered thee from the perils of fancy and the depths of heedlessness. Therefore, show not faithlessness to thy Beloved, and stand firm in thy covenant, for none hath been or shall be acquainted with the root of the matter. I swear by My Beauty that all that hath been heard hath proceeded from Mine own Self, and none beside Me hath been or shall ever be My partner. Yet in the concealment of matters there lie hidden wisdoms which none save the discerning and perspicacious can comprehend.</p>
<p>O Majid! Be thou as a cutting sword against Mine enemies and as a beneficial mercy unto My loved ones. Through My remembrance, be thou independent of all else, and through My love, be free from aught else besides Me. Like a restless lover, seek intimacy with the Best Beloved and at all times occupy thyself with the wondrous praise of Him. Should thou find the whole world turned away from My Beauty, account them all as non-existent and consider them as nothing. These are the compassionate counsels which have shone forth from the Dayspring of My holy mouth. Hearken thou unto them and be of them that prostrate themselves. And praise be unto My Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>

<p>This is the mention of the Leaf of Divine Identity upon the shore of holiness, on the branches of the Lote-Tree of Paradise. O ye dwellers of the Throne! Hearken unto Me. He it is Who speaketh the truth and hath sent forth the Messengers of the Cause, that ye should worship none but God and then believe in His Beauty. And among the people are those who follow their idle fancies and turn away from God, and are like unto them who worship idols and are devoted to them. And among the people are those who have detached themselves from all who are in the heavens and are not shaken by the trials of adversity, and are of them who hasten unto the dawning-places of light. These are they through whose names the pavilions of Divine Identity were raised up and the mysteries of the Cause were revealed and the Dove warbled with wondrous hidden knowledge. Thus doth God exalt whom He pleaseth by His command and rewardeth those who are detached unto Him, and giveth them to drink at all times from a fountain which ye know not. And thereby He teacheth them the ways of righteousness and guideth them to the paths of guidance, and they ascend at every moment unto the heaven of knowledge while the angels of the spirit hover above their heads with chalices of light, moving about them in circles. These are they who comprehend all knowledge from a single letter of the Book and take account of all things and see with the eye of God, did ye but know it. And God hath nourished them with the fruits of oneness and raised them from the couch of their hearts and made them to be of those who rejoice in the days of God. Thus have We expounded for thee from the laws of them who are nigh unto God, that thou mayest drink therefrom and be of the souls who are suspended in the atmosphere of the spirit, and follow the path of right guidance in their ways, and be guided by the guidance of God, and be of those who turn their faces toward the resting-places of the spirit. Say: O people! This is My path whereby We guide you, and We cast upon you holy counsels, if ye would be counselled. And glory be upon you and upon the sincere servants.</p>

<p>The atoms have spoken even as the Revealer of Verses spoke when He came with clear proofs such as none in the heavens and earth could bring forth the like thereof. The Ark of Names hath sailed upon the sea of My Most Exalted Name, and the tongues of all created things have uttered that which was sent down in the Tablet from God, the Sublime, the Great.</p>
<p>The ocean hath surged with longing to meet Me, and the winds have been stirred, seeking My straight and manifest path. All things have been moved by the call of God, the Lord of all things, yet the people remain in strange slumber. The realities have taken flight and the horizon of the Cause hath been illumined, yet the people are in evident drunkenness. Among them is he whom the world hath withheld from the Lord of Names, and among them is he who hath followed vain desires, turning away from guidance, and among them is he who hath taken the books of idle fancies and cast behind him that which was sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds, and among them is he who hath said “He hath fabricated a lie against God.” Say: O thou rejected one! By God! Through this Revelation the darkness hath been illumined and all things have been drawn unto God, the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O thou who wert struck by the pain of separation at the moment of attaining thy goal! I am He who doth not fear to separate. I am He who doth not hesitate to divide. If thou wishest to know Me, know that I am He Who preventeth those who are dying of longing from attaining My Holy Presence and who debarreth them from access to My Throne. I am He Who consumeth the hearts of the lovers in the fire of separation and Who abandoneth them in the wildernesses of the world. I am He Who respondeth not to supplications and Who doth not turn towards those who petition Him. I am He Whose riches never hear the lamentations of the poor, and Whose glory cometh never to the succour of the weak or the humble. Thus it is when I am seated on the throne of My Name the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>But when I am established on the Seat of My Name the Merciful, I guide to the living waters of My presence those who have gone astray and cause them to enter the paradise of reunion with me, whence I shall not banish them. I am He Who giveth to the poor access to the gardens of My wealth, to the feeble entry to the tabernacles of My power, and Who openeth to the humble the city of Mine ancient glory. I am He Who answereth supplications and remembereth him who maketh mention of Me. From all eternity I have replied to the prayers of the needy! I am He Who respondeth ere he is asked and Who giveth in abundance without regard to merit. Such is My nature!</p>
<p>I am He Who weepeth by reason of the tears of those who love Me, and Who draweth near unto those who seek Me. I have opened the portals of My bounty to all the inhabitants of heaven and earth. Blessed be those who enter therein! O thou who hast presented thyself before My throne, I heard thy voice and thy lamentations when thou wert separated from Me, and grieved over what afflicted thee in accordance with God’s inscrutable decree. I beg God to protect thee until thou reachest thy home, for He is the Most Merciful of the Merciful!</p>
<p>O thou who hast attained unto separation! Thou hast been afflicted with parting, and I am the Separator and care not, and I am the Disperser and fear not. If thou desirest to know Me, know that I am He Who preventeth those who long for Me from entering My holy court, and removeth them far from the seat of My throne. I am He Who setteth aflame the hearts of lovers with the fire of separation and leaveth them in the wilderness of horizons. I am He Who, when called upon, answereth not, and when remembered, turneth not. I am He Whose riches hear not the cry of the poor, and Whose might payeth no heed to the weak and lowly. This is the time of My sitting upon the throne of My Name, the Compeller, and when I sit upon the throne of My Name, the All-Merciful, I guide the misguided to the fountain of My presence and cause them to enter the paradise of My reunion, never to depart therefrom. I am He Who causeth the poor to enter the heaven of My riches, and the weak beneath the tabernacle of My power, and the lowly within the city of My ancient glory. I am He Who, when called upon, respondeth, and when remembered, remembereth, and have ever been the Answerer of the cry of them that are distressed. I am He Who answereth before being asked and giveth without desert, and this is My nature. I am He Who weepeth at the weeping of the lovers and draweth nigh unto them that draw nigh, and have opened the gates of My favor unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed are they that enter therein.</p>

The purpose of all creation hath been and ever shall be the recognition of the Ancient Being and the assurance of attaining His presence. This sublime and most exalted matter cannot be realized except through the Manifestation of His Self, Who is Him and none else. His Manifestation hath never been, nor shall ever be, confined within any limitation or made contingent upon any permission or command, inasmuch as every command is ordained by His command and remembered by His remembrance. He hath been and shall ever be, in His own Self, independent of and sanctified above all else besides Him. In every Revelation, He revealeth the essence of that Revelation in a manner contrary to the understanding and desires of men, and this very contrariness is the standard and the path of His Cause, and the source of tests and trials. Even as was witnessed in the Revelation of the Year Sixty, when the Promised Beauty appeared in a way contrary to all that the people possessed, whereupon such a clamor arose among the servants that every learned one fell, every illumined one was darkened, and every exalted one was brought low–all these conditions being witnessed with manifest evidence. In such circumstances, man must at all times fix his gaze upon the fundamental proof of God and that whereby all proofs have been established, lest he be veiled from the Source of Revelation and all his deeds and actions be rendered null and void while he remaineth unaware. As witnessed today, all are veiled by this malady save whom thy Lord willeth. Yet we hope that a breeze of grace may waft over you and draw you from the west of remoteness to the east of nearness, that you may find repose in the eternal holy Ridvan in the company of the holy manifestations of divine fellowship.

Regarding agriculture, they have given a general ruling in these matters, which is that it is obligatory for every soul to engage in a profession, agriculture, or craft, and that very work itself is worship in the sight of God, even if one tarries but a day in any land. Thus, in the days of departure from Iraq, although preparations were being made for migration, nevertheless they were engaged in farming, and at the time of departure it was commanded that the harvest be distributed among the friends.

<p>Tablet of Mahdi-Quli - Upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>He is the Wronged One in the world. A Tablet revealed by the Ancient King to one who turned unto Him and attained unto His Day, which was mentioned in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers. We have manifested the Cause and sent down the proof and evidence. To this testifieth He Who hath spoken before all faces. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Mahdi-Quli! My Afnan hath mentioned thee and thy letter hath come before My presence. We have heard thy call and have answered thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer. When We desired to make mention of thee, the ocean of utterance surged, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in the Kingdom of knowledge: “O peoples of all religions! Turn ye unto that which ye were promised by the Most Exalted Pen of God, then give thanks unto your Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. He hath manifested Himself and fulfilled His promise through His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of Our loved ones who are there, that the remembrance may attract them to this luminous horizon. Say: Beware lest the oppression of the oppressors frighten you, or the might of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy might and Thy grandeur, Thy power and Thy sovereignty, and by the Kawthar which hath flowed from Thy Pen, and by the light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the ignorant nor the clamor of every remote learned one may keep me back. O Lord! Open before my face the door of Thy knowledge and illumine my heart with the light of Thy grace. Then write down for me that which Thou hast written for them that are near unto Thee among Thy servants. Verily, Thou art He Who hath stood before all faces and hast manifested that which was hidden, treasured and concealed from Thy servants and Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector of those who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>O David the physician! The All-Loving Lord proclaims in the Most Holy Book: There hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen that which constitutes an impregnable fortress for the protection of mankind and a guiding light unto the Most Great Horizon. Say: Cleave ye thereunto, O people of God, and be not of the heedless ones. Justice and fairness are as two wings for the servants of God, and blessed is the state of the soul that hath attained unto these twain and become detached from all that is in the world and in the realm of creation. This is the Day of freedom, know ye this. The false tales of ancient times have kept the servants back from the Lord of all beings. The people of Persia, both day and night, were engaged in the remembrance of the Goal of the world’s desire and yearned for the appearance of the Self-Subsisting One. Yet when the veils were rent asunder by the finger of Him Who revealeth the verses, and the luminous dawn broke forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, all turned away. The cause and reason for their turning away were those souls who, without God’s leave, followed those heedless and ignorant ones. We beseech God–glorified be His majesty–to aid all to achieve unity and concord, and likewise to grant them success in reflecting and deliberating upon those matters which are the cause of tranquility and deliverance. Praise be to God that the Dawning-Place of verses hath appeared and the Dayspring of clear tokens standeth manifest before all faces. While time remaineth, strive ye, that haply ye may attain unto the everlasting bounty and the eternal feast. This bounty is the protector of the servants, and this feast is the helper and sustainer of all peoples. O David! He Who is mentioned from the prison maketh mention of thee and commandeth that which shall protect and preserve thee. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the All-Wise Counsellor and the All-Knowing Remembrancer.</p>

<p>Your letter, imbued with loving allusions and sprinkled with the dewdrops of attraction, was received and presented before the Throne. He spoke, saying: “The Servant of the One has fallen into the well of envy, and the Spirit’s Servant into the prison of hatred, and the Ancient Beauty into the cage of rancor. God shall soon send forth hosts of angels and deliver Him forth in truth and render Him victorious throughout the earth, and His countenance shall shine forth amongst all the worlds. The Servant hath sought no help from anyone, and there is no victory save through His bidding. He aideth whomsoever He willeth by His leave, and He is the Ever-Victorious from time immemorial, and He is the Helper throughout all eternity.”</p>

God willing, may you remain occupied with the remembrance of the Beloved throughout all days, sanctified and detached from aught else but Him. May you drink from the Most Glorious Wine and be sustained by the most enduring grace, that perchance, through the favors of the All-Glorious Lord, you may become purified from the allusions of these days and find rest and repose in the seat of steadfastness and the station of luminous glory through the love of God. And should anyone resolve to journey, God willing, the wondrous and glorious Tablet that hath been sent down from the heaven of exalted glory shall be dispatched.</p>

Since this deed is acceptable in the sight of God, the Most Exalted Pen has desired its promulgation, and this Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will that all may read it and cleave unto goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. Today, whatsoever deed is manifested from those who are nigh and the monotheists for the sake of God is effective and influential in the world. Blessed is the soul who, detached from all else, ariseth to do that which God loveth. The fragrance of a good deed hath never ceased, nor shall it ever cease. We convey Our greetings to the friends in that land–that is, to those souls who are detached from all save God and who are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We counsel all to observe chastity, trustworthiness, faithfulness, mercy, compassion, generosity, and likewise wisdom. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for thee through His Most Exalted Pen that which He hath destined for His chosen ones.

Therefore, give thanks unto God for having acquainted thee with His most resplendent Beauty, for having provided thee with the fruits of eternity from the Farthest Tree, for having honored thee with holy glances from the Most Exalted Scene, and for having strengthened thee with the Spirit in what He commanded and revealed. This is a bounty that none of understanding can surpass.

Some maintain that the source and essence of elemental fire is the warmth in the hearts of lovers and the sighs of yearning souls. Others hold that this quality existeth in all things, for had the attraction of the Divine Beauty not seized upon His servants, their realities, being of pure essence, would never have accepted these opposing forms, becoming thus the manifestation of worldly events and the target of earthly decrees. Therefore it becometh evident that the cause of realities and meanings accepting the garments of limitations and forms hath been, and ever shall be, the warmth of Divine love.

Grieve thou not except for My grief. He will send down unto thee that which hath been ordained for thee. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O Mulla Yahya, upon thee be the Glory of God, He Who is the Guardian over all names.</p>
<p>O Yahya! My Most Exalted Pen hath moved among the people at eventide and at dawn, and hath called all unto God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, Who hath come from the heaven of grace with a power that the might of the wicked could not overcome. The servant who is present hath appeared and made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with a remembrance that no other remembrance can equal. We made mention of thee before, and at this hour when the horizon of the heaven of My proof hath been illumined with the Day-Star of inner meanings and utterance. Take hold of the Book of God with strength and set aside that which proceedeth from the daysprings of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath hearkened unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of thy son who was named Ghulam-Qabl-Husayn and thine other son who attained the lights of recognition in his final abode. We send Our greetings upon the countenance of thy wife and thy daughters who have believed in the Almighty, the All-Bestowing, through Whose Name the ocean of utterance hath surged in the realm of possibilities and the breeze of God hath wafted over all lands. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you and upon every servant who hath arisen to aid the Cause with humility and hath turned unto God in repentance. And praise be to God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>

Verily, those who have cast away what they possessed and have taken what hath been sent down from God, the denizens of the immortal cities shall circle round them, though the people perceive it not. Glorify thy Lord with praise and commune with Him, then detach thyself from all who are on earth.

Hold fast to the hem of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Leave the people and what they possess behind thee and trust in God in all matters. Verily, He is with whosoever desireth Him and aideth those who speak in His praise and remembrance. He is, in truth, the Mighty, the Forgiving.

<p>Today We have arisen speaking in remembrance of God, the Lord of all worlds. And when the verses were revealed, a gazelle approached the Throne and sat before the Countenance in front of the Throne with manifest humility, and it was listening to the verses of God as though illumined by the lights of its Lord’s utterance, the All-Subduing, the All-Knowing. How many learned men have been barred from the direction of the Known One, while this animal hath approached the All-Merciful and hearkeneth to that which no created thing between the heavens and earth can equal. Verily bounty is in God’s hand - He giveth to whomsoever He willeth and withholdeth from whomsoever He willeth. Within His grasp is the kingdom of might and power. He, verily, is the Ruler, the Giver, the Generous, the Ancient of Days. Thus have We recounted unto thee what We witnessed, that thou mayest be convinced that all things are drawn to the breezes of Revelation save those who have turned away and are among the most lost. These are but worthless rabble whose station God hath ordained to be below that of animals, as doth testify to this the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Rejoice thou in this Tablet, then render thanks unto thy Lord, the Kind, the Merciful.</p>

<p>I bear witness that thou hast witnessed the dawn of Kufih and the evening of Karbila. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful, for having made thee capable of bearing afflictions in His path and calamities in His love. Verily, those who have been touched by tribulation in the path of the Lord of Names are remembered by all things, and the dwellers of the cities of eternity glorify them. Blessed art thou, O My servant! Thou hast borne harm in My love and been made a captive in thy desire to attain My presence and turn to the Kaaba of My loving-kindness. Behold, then remember what hath been sent down from My Pen in the Tablet of My Command and what hath appeared from the treasuries of My mysteries from the hidden pearls of My knowledge. We have spoken, and Our word is the truth: Should abasement touch you for the sake of My Name, be not grieved. Thus hath the Sun of the Word shone forth from the horizon of the utterance of the Lord of all created things, would that ye might know. And the splendor be upon you, O My loved ones, throughout the duration of My dominion and My kingdom and the warbling of the birds of My eternity upon the branches of the Tree of My Cause.

Beware lest thou grieve over what hath befallen thee in My path. Be thou grateful and be of the patient ones. Doth anyone imagine that he will be left uncontrolled? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Through your exile We draw the servants nigh unto the Salsabil of mercy - blessed are they that drink thereof! And through your abasement We clothe with the garment of glory those who hasten to the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty proclaimeth: “I, verily, am your Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.” Blessed are ye, and blessed are the mothers who bore your bodies, and your fathers who reared you.

At all times ye must take refuge with God, that perchance ye may remain preserved through the protection of the Lord of the Day of Judgment from the schemes of the schemers and the deceptions of the deceivers. For the schemes of the schemers have reached such a point that if all the pens in the celestial realm were to attempt to enumerate them, they would surely prove powerless and fall short. And if they should grow weary or unable to deceive while people are awake, they resort to the realm of sleep and make mention of dreams, that perchance they might cause some innocent soul to stray from the straight path. They are heedless that the educating hand of the divine Lord and the grasp of the power of the Eternal trains servants who will not take their eyes from the beauty of the Friend even should the arrows of tribulation rain down from the clouds of destiny, and who count all that exists as utter nothingness, as though it had never been mentioned.</p>

We bid thee to show forth the greatest steadfastness in the love of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings. Hold fast to it, detached from the doubters. The fragrance of the garment has been diffused and the sweet savors of God have wafted among all, young and old. Blessed is he who has attained thereunto and woe unto the heedless. Be thou glad in the remembrance of the Wronged One of thee. He remembers His loved ones even while He is in the hands of the oppressors. Thus has the scratching of My Pen been raised and the ocean of My mercy surged, as a bounty from My presence upon thee. Be thou grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that seek Thee.</p>

<p>The All-Glorious, the Most Holy 521 [The Most Splendid]</p>
<p>The Divine Sage who was named as the First Pillar of the Two Greatest Names is held in most luminous regard. May my spirit be sacrificed for thee! The flowing pen of your holiness has stirred all pillars and roots. Willingly have we drunk from its cup the wine of love and joy. And since it indicated the good health of your eminence, it brought the utmost gladness and delight, and was presented before His face. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: We beseech God to strengthen him at all times, draw him near in all seasons, and grant him what hath been ordained for him from the All-Merciful. He is verily the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Regarding what had been written inquiring about the divine utterances in the assembly, that which remains in this servant’s memory is hereby presented: On the first night, at the time of the evening prayer, He proceeded to the Pasha’s assembly where a large gathering had congregated, all in utmost trepidation and anxiety. The Ancient Beauty reclined at the head of the assembly and remained entirely silent, as the attendees were occupied in consultation and discourse among themselves. None accompanied Him to that assembly save His Holiness the Most Great Branch, may my spirit be sacrificed for the dust of His holy steps. Then the Pasha arose and stated that “You should proceed to another location, as we now wish to interrogate these prisoners.” Thus did the Beauty of Unity proceed to another place known as the administrative chamber. In that place, the Two Most Great Branches, Aqay-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Quli, Aqa Muhammad-’Ali Isfahani, Aqa Muhammad-Javad, and Aqa Muhammad-Husayn ibn Haji ’Ali-’Askar were present before Him, along with some officers and others from the palace. He remained there until the seventh hour, continuously revealing verses of grandeur. Among other things, He said to this servant, “Do you remember the verses that were revealed the night before?” Then He recited those verses in the most exalted tone, and those verses are:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Everlasting, the Eternal, the Mighty, the Great […]</p>
<p>The ocean of tribulation hath surged, and its waves have encompassed the Ark of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Fear not, O Mariner, the tempestuous winds, for He Who causeth the dawn to break is with thee in this darkness that hath enveloped the worlds. Put thy trust in God under all conditions, and fear not the blasts of the winds of hatred. Take refuge in God, thy Lord, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. He protecteth whom He willeth through His authority; He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. In the midst of darkness, the Face was radiant with a light that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. In that state, We summoned all creation unto God, and the gathering of those who disbelieved in God when He came with a wondrous Cause did not frighten Us. The thief hath stolen what was revealed from the Throne and presented it to those who rule over the servants. Thus did that remote polytheist. Say: Die in thy fury, O ignorant one! Dost thou imagine that thou canst outstrip Us? Nay, by My Name through which the fragrance of the Spirit hath wafted over all things small and great! We delivered the Cause through Our messengers, for verily We were powerful. Then We spread it through the hands of those who turned away. The scheming of schemers shall not harm it. The slinking whisperer came with My Book before the people, thinking thereby they would assault the Dayspring of the Cause and thereby degrade the station of God before all else. Thus did his soul entice him, and the word of punishment from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Encompassing, was fulfilled against him. Say: Thereby is His Cause exalted, His verses spread abroad, and this Remembrance elevated, whereby every wise matter hath been ordained. Would that the servants would gather against Us and shed Our blood in this straight Path! We have sacrificed what We possessed in the path of God, as attested by the tribulations We are in, and behind them the Pen whereby the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Wise, hath been established. Say: I await the day wherein I shall behold Myself among the parties of the armies of the oppressors. By God! Then shall they hear what they have never heard before, and see what no eyes of those gone before have seen. He is verily the Ruler over what He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Mighty. Say: O fly! Canst thou soar with the Dove in this atmosphere wherein the birds of the world have never soared? All that befalleth Us is a mercy unto Us, as every discerning believer doth testify. The atoms weep at Our affliction, while We are in manifest joy. We have manifested gladness from the horizon of sorrows. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>At that time, they paid no attention whatsoever to the officials. The Blessed Countenance was turned toward the Most Great Branch and the Greater Branch, may my spirit be sacrificed for them both, and some of the loved ones who were present in service. Then the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance surged forth. Among other things He said: “God, the Blessed and Exalted, revealed to one of His Prophets in His revelation: ‘By My glory and majesty! I shall surely cut off the hope of every hopeful one who hopes in other than Me, clothe him with the garment of disgrace before all people, and remove him far from My grace and relief. Does My servant hope in other than Me in times of hardship, while its key is in My hand? What is wrong with Me that I see My servant turning away from Me when I have given him what he has not asked of Me? Should I be asked and not be generous? Never! Does not generosity and munificence belong to Me? Are not this world and the next in My hands? If everyone in the heavens and earth were to ask Me the equivalent of the heavens and earth, and I were to grant it, this would not diminish My dominion by even as much as a gnat’s wing.’” And similar utterances which are mostly not remembered continuously flowed from the All-Merciful’s lips. “He partook of the cups of utterance from the wine of thy Lord, the All-Merciful’s mention.” What can I say of how the signs of power, grandeur and sovereignty poured forth and descended on that blessed night! “The Salsabil of utterance was bestowed upon all contingent beings, the ocean of generosity sprinkled upon the nations, and the mystery enshrouded in mystery was revealed to all in the unseen and visible realms.” Many of the utterances have completely vanished from this servant’s memory. Some that remain in mind have been presented. Later, at the seventh hour, one of the officers came and took away the Ancient Beauty, the two Most Great Branches, and Aqay-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Quli. The Ancient Beauty and the Greater Branch were placed in a location adjacent to the prison, Aqay-i in another place, and the Most Great Branch in the prison under strict guard. This servant and the other friends were imprisoned under strict guard in a very dark place in the same building. On the second night, a telegram came from the governor and they changed the Ancient Beauty’s location to a high domed chamber above the prison. This was at the time of the evening prayer, and the Most Great Branch, the Greater Branch and Aqay-i were also in the Most Holy Presence. The stay in the dome was thirty-eight and a half hours. Then again on Thursday, at the fourth hour after sunrise, they summoned them to the building for questioning. While proceeding to the assembly, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these words repeatedly: “You have taken hold of your own principles and cast the principles of God behind your backs. What is wrong with you that you do not understand?” After the Pasha and the members of the assembly arrived, they apologized saying that they were obliged to investigate since three people had been killed and all the people of the city were frightened and terrified, therefore the law must be followed. Apparently the poor man had no knowledge even of the law […]</p>
<p>When they inquired about His blessed name and homeland, stating that according to law these questions must be asked and recorded, He declared: “It is more evident than the sun.” When asked again, He said: “It is not befitting to mention the name. Look at the government decree which you have.” Then, with utmost gentleness, they requested that He Himself declare it. Thereupon, the Temple of Grandeur sat upright upon the chair and spoke with the tongue of power and might: “My name is Baha’u’llah and My dwelling place is Nur.” Then the Ancient Beauty turned to the Mufti and said, may His grandeur be exalted: “Had you known, We would have caused you to hear the cooing of the Dove of Grandeur upon the branch of the Divine Lote-Tree, that you might understand the meaning of ‘Servitude is a substance, the essence of which is Lordship.’” Those present were stunned by this eternal Word of God. Then, addressing all present, He said: “What is the purpose of this gathering and these questions and answers? If you wish, I will acknowledge what is your intention and the desire of your hearts, for I do not wish to remain in this world even for a moment.” And He recited verses from the Surih of the Kings, including this blessed passage: “I have never passed by a tree, but My heart addressed it saying: ‘O would that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee in My Lord’s way.’” During His utterance, the foundations of the All-Merciful were seized with trembling. Then He arose and the Beauty of the All-Knowing turned toward another place outside the gathering.</p>
<p>O my master, what can I say? It was a wondrous day and a wondrous time. In some souls the Sun of the Word of God shone forth and they showed forth love. In truth, this servant is incapable of mentioning the divine utterances. The author of the Mathnavi has mentioned something appropriate to this station:</p>
<p>That discourse which the Prophet spoke that day,</p>
<p>If it should strike the night, would turn it day;</p>
<p>That dark night would become bright as the morn,</p>
<p>But I cannot speak that sacred tongue now born.</p>
<p>You know what says the sun in Aries</p>
<p>To herbs and plants in gardens such as these;</p>
<p>You know what says that pure and flowing stream</p>
<p>To plants and flowers that on its borders gleam.</p>
<p>Verily, this servant was and shall ever be powerless to make mention of the divine utterances and heavenly terms. Subsequently the Pasha sent word requesting a return to the house and sought pardon for what had transpired. They said return to the original prison was preferable as some were imprisoned there. Certain ones came into His presence and submitted that the townspeople were in commotion and the prisoners could not be brought out - it would be better to wait a few days. Then they returned to the house at eleven o’clock in the day. From the beginning of departure from the sanctuary until the final return thereto, sixty-nine and a half hours had elapsed: five and a half hours’ stay in the serai the first night, eighteen and a half hours in the prison adjoining the barracks, thirty-eight and a half hours in confinement in the tower above the barracks, and seven hours’ stay in the serai the second time. In truth it was observed that this letter had become very lengthy, therefore I have confined myself to this much, although the fire of love cries out “Is there more?” and by whatever means possible seeks to make mention and cause trouble. We beseech God to assist your honor and this servant and all the friends to remember and praise Him. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Muhammad Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God, having sent a copy of the Beirut newspaper - its origin was not from Beirut but was printed in London. The details are that some Europeans came and strove earnestly to attain the presence but were not accepted. They spent some days in the service of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto the dust of His sacred feet - and after returning to their countries, they recorded the details which were published in newspapers. In Beirut they translated the London newspaper which was in English into Arabic and printed some parts, while refraining from mentioning others for fear of the government, as in the original newspaper which is now in this servant’s possession they wrote of the afflictions as well. Similarly newspapers came from Prussia where they also gave details and questioned how the Sublime State had not acted according to this matter but rather had arisen to cause harm - all of these are in this servant’s possession. However, after the recent events, a malicious person from this land sent a letter to the director of the Beirut press, and that poor man unknowingly printed it in Al-Najah. Although in his own mind what he wrote was out of enmity, in reality he proclaimed the Cause without understanding. Regarding this the blessed verse was revealed: “Verily We have proclaimed the Cause through the agency of Our messengers, for verily We were powerful. Then We spread it through the hands of those who turned away. Verily the scheming of the schemers shall not harm it.”</p>
<p>Furthermore I request that you convey the expressions of evanescence, nothingness and sincerity of this transient servant to each of the friends, especially to Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, Haji ’Abdu’l-Majid, Aqa Muhammad-Rida, Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, and Aqa ’Abdu’llah - convey to all the Most Glorious and Most Wondrous greetings. The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree remember your honor with wondrous and sublime mention, and likewise the friends trouble you with expressions of boundless sincerity. Verily the spirit, glory and splendor be upon you and upon those with you and those who love you.</p>

And whoso holdeth fast to the cord of God and placeth his trust in Him - these are they who have attained their portion from their Lord and they rejoice in the Most Glorious Paradise. Thus doth God recompense everyone according to their due measure - and who is better than God in measuring, if ye but ponder the verses of God? He it is Who hath perfected the creation of all things and established His Own Cause. And who is mightier than God in command and more exalted in power? Glorified be He! His is the sovereignty and all bear witness unto Him. He is the One Who standeth supreme over His Cause, doing as He willeth, and none can question His doings. Verily thy Lord Who created thee is able to sustain thee and return thee to what thou wert. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is God, the Restorer, the Sovereign, the Originator, the Oft-Returning, the Merciful.</p>

<p>He is God!</p>
<p>The honored Mirza Mihdi hath been specially favored with God’s all-embracing mercy. He hath, at no time, been careless in recording the words of God, nor hath he neglected their dispatch. Would that he might, with utmost renunciation, abide within the retreats of celestial glory, and spend His days in close union with them who are the manifestations of His love. The world shall pass away and be no more. Were it found to be endowed with any special distinction, would He Who is the Most Pure Essence have consented to condemn Himself to such incalculable and deadly perils? Wherefore take ye good heed!</p>
<p>Convey special greetings to My esteemed spouse. Be not careless of her needs, for manifold are the adversities that have befallen her. Such adversities, however, are painless in the path of the Well-Beloved. Aqa Muhammad Ali will acquaint thee with certain details and thou wilt readily acknowledge that all the afflictions of the world fade into utter nothingness when compared with the harm that hath been inflicted upon Us.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to thy distinguished Guest. No news hath reached Us concerning Munib. The spirit of God rest upon thee!</p>
<p>A Tablet, revealed in honor of the renown Muhammad Husayn who dwelleth in the Land of Kaf, hath been written to Aqa Siyyid Mihdi that he may deliver it. It would be highly acceptable in Our sight should a number of additional Tablets and Scriptures reach him.</p>

<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God and the God of all who dwell in existence, both the unseen and the manifest! I testify before Thee and before those who inhabit the kingdom of Thy creation that I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have believed in Thee and in Thy signs and in Thy Prophets and in Thy Messengers. I bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been powerful over all things and sovereign over earth and heaven, and Thou wilt ever continue to be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by the heaven of Thy Will and the ocean of Thy Purpose to make me in all conditions turned towards Thee and steadfast in Thy love. O Lord! Thou art the Master and I am the servant. I ask Thee to assist me in serving Thee and enable me to remember Thee and praise Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest in the kingdom of creation and command. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath appeared and caused to appear that which hath broken the necks of the Pharaohs and caused the limbs of the tyrants to tremble–they who denied God’s proof and His evidence, who turned away from His sovereignty, who rejected His signs, and who are the divines of Persia that pronounced judgment against the Dawning-Place of God’s verses and the Dayspring of His evidences, who shed His blood and slew His loved ones and His friends. God is quit of them, and so too are the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise, and they who circle round His mighty Throne. Glory and praise be unto them whom neither clamor nor the howling of those who violated the Covenant of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, could deter. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined the people of Baha with the light of Thy knowledge and for having sent down unto them from the heaven of Thy bounty that which hath gladdened the eyes of the sincere ones among Thy creatures. I beseech Thee to make them the signs of Thy remembrance and the standards of Thy Cause in Thy lands. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived like a divine herald from the realm of inner meanings, bearing multiple glad-tidings: first, the glad-tidings of divine love; second, of arising to serve His Cause; and third, news of that honored one’s health and well-being. Each of these is, in truth, a perfect bounty and an all-encompassing favor. Its perusal wafted the breezes of joy and diffused the fragrance of delight. Praise be to the Goal of all the worlds for having caused that spiritual beloved to be enkindled with the fire of His Lote-Tree–an enkindlement whose heat is manifest from the words of his letter. After its perusal, it was presented before the Divine Presence and achieved the honor of being heard. This is what the tongue of our Lord, the Most Merciful, uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance–His Word: “His light hath shone forth and His sovereignty hath been made manifest.”</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Messenger! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen! On this day all things are engaged in praise, glorification and thanksgiving. At this moment the sun proclaims with the loudest voice “The All-Bountiful has come!”, and the trees cry out “The Chosen One has appeared!”, while the Concourse on High declares “The veil has been rent asunder and He Who is the Lord of the Kingdom of Names is established upon the Throne of Utterance!” The very atoms of the world give each other glad tidings of the lights of the Kingdom and the appearance of the Lord of the Realm of Might. Yet few are found who have ears worthy to hear.</p>
<p>In all the Books, Scriptures and Psalms this Day has been named the Day of God, yet most of the people of the world remain heedless, veiled and opposed. The people of utterance are striving with the utmost endeavor to extinguish the divine light and quench the fire of the celestial Tree. This Wronged One has been, from the earliest days until now, a captive and prisoner in the hands of the enemies. Nevertheless, they have said that which no oppressor has ever said. Say: O people! Today this blessed word, which is the essence of all Books and Scriptures, has been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen and set before the face of the Lord of all mankind, namely: “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.”</p>
<p>O thou who speakest My praise! Were the people of the earth to become aware of the hidden treasure within this blessed Word, all would hasten to circle round it and would cleave to that which is with God rather than to that which is with them. Today the river of mercy flows from the Pen, the light of utterance shines forth from the horizon of the heaven of possibility, and the ocean of knowledge surges before the faces of the world. Yet those souls who are consumed by the fire of hatred and malice are deprived and forbidden from all these. Base nature has reached such a point that they occupy themselves with false tales of old. Those who are engaged in service before His face have clung to such a person while remaining heedless and veiled from the Truth.</p>
<p>The river of mercy proclaims with the loudest call: O people! Hold fast to justice and cleave to equity. Your idle fancies will not suffice you in place of the Lord of all beings, nor will your conjectures suffice in place of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Cast aside the book of your own selves and take hold of the Book of God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. He calls out with the most exalted voice: O concourse of earth and heaven! Be fair in this Cause whereby the limbs of the world and the hearts of nations have trembled, and in that which hath appeared from His presence. Be not of those who observe and deny, who hear the call yet turn away from it, who hear the verses yet dispute them. These, verily, comprehend not.</p>
<p>Say: O people! I was asleep when the Call awakened Me, and I was silent when the Truth, the Knower of the unseen, caused Me to speak and commanded Me to raise My voice in this atmosphere. This is not My crime, if ye be fair. Fear God, O people, and follow not the desires of every ignorant one, nor follow those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed. Were it not for the Glory, who would stand before all faces and who would guide the servants to the path of God, the Mighty, the All-Loving? Through Him the Trumpet was blown, the dwellers of the graves arose, and the Cause of God appeared before the eyes of the princes and kings. Through Him were the signs of God spread abroad, the mysteries unveiled, the lights made manifest, and the seas set in motion.</p>
<p>O Messenger! Upon thee be My loving-kindness! I was walking in the House, speaking that which the parties of the earth are prevented from knowing and their ears from hearing, save whom God, the Lord of this exalted station, willeth. The servant in attendance entered with thy letter[…]</p>
<p>O Lord my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy tribulations and imprisonment and by what hath befallen Thee in the prison-city of Ta, and by the lights of Thy Revelation and the stations that have been honored by Thy footsteps and the cities that have been illumined by the radiance of Thy countenance and the things that have been adorned by Thy glance and the air wherein arose Thy sighs at what hath befallen Thy loved ones, to assist Thy servants to return unto Thee. Every fair-minded one beareth witness to Thy greatness and Thy power and to the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace. O Lord! Aid them to achieve that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and withhold them not from the fountainhead of Thy knowledge and the dawning-place of Thy wisdom and the dayspring of Thy most great signs and the source of Thy most exalted and most glorious Cause. Thou art He in Whose grasp are the reins of the highest rank and the control of all who are in earth and heaven. Ordain through Thy will that which will draw Thy servants nigh unto the court of Thy glory and the carpet of Thy grandeur. Then help them through Thy bounty and might and through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, that they may hasten with their hearts unto Thee and forsake all else besides Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>These days are the manifestation of this blessed verse of the Qur’an which states “They have eyes with which they see not” to the end of the verse. For it is observed that eyes physically exist, yet most factions are prevented from seeing; likewise ears exist, yet they are deprived of hearing. The Greatest Talisman is manifest, yet no one perceives. They speak according to their own beliefs, yet before God they are dumb and mute. This particularly applies to those who turn away from the Bayan, who seem deprived of understanding and truthfulness. Now mention is made of Mu’awiyih’s golden peas, which is among the falsehoods of the Shi’ih sect. Most of what this group has possessed has been devoid of truth. Mu’awiyih openly did whatever he desired and feared no one’s words in pursuing such matters. O My loved one! Justice and fairness have vanished, and in their place tyranny and oppression reign. In such circumstances they do what they please and say what they wish, nothing restrains them. These are they who ride the steeds of self and passion, galloping in the arena of error and wretchedness. They fear not God, nor do they show shame before His servants. They do what none before them has done, and say what no oppressive souls have said. It is best that we pass over mention of heedless souls and occupy ourselves with the remembrance and utterance of God, though even this is said as counsel to the servants, that they might catch the fragrance of truth and turn to its horizon. We beseech God to give them to drink from the cup of truth and the chalice of knowledge, that they may return unto Him, submissive and lowly. Verily, He is the Most Powerful of the powerful and the Most Generous of the generous. Praise be to God that that spiritual friend has arisen to serve the Cause with perfect steadfastness and complete devotion in days when sight and hearing have become like the phoenix - existing in name but absent in reality. All shall receive the recompense of their deeds and soon shall find themselves in evident torment. I convey mention, praise and glory to the friends in that land, and I beseech the True One to make each like an immovable mountain and like an undulating ocean in this Most Great Cause, and to ordain for each that which neither perishes nor changes. He is the Powerful One before Whom the power of the world and its peoples is as nothing and non-existent. This servant has ever mentioned and continues to mention all in the Most Holy Court. Verily, He is the Protector of the sincere ones and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O My friends! One of My loved ones has made mention of you, and We have made mention of you with a remembrance around which all remembrances circle. Verily the Divine Lote Tree desires to send you a wondrous, fresh fruit, and the Ocean of Utterance to honor you with one of its waves, and the Sun of Truth with one of its effulgences, that the attraction of grace and favors may so seize you that neither the tongues of the polytheists, nor the words of the deniers, nor the might of the oppressors, nor the doubts of the croakers who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds, may prevent you. O party of God, rejoice! O hosts of God, rejoice! For today, by the attestation of the Truth, glorified be His majesty, you possess hearing and sight and are endowed with the light of divine love, having attained to that which was the hope of the Messengers. This station is great and this rank mighty. Strive that perchance you may, with joy and radiance, guide the wayward to the divine ocean of knowledge and direct them to the straight path. You have always been and continue to be remembered. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, for this great bounty and for this remembrance, each letter of which God has made a treasure with Him. Verily He is the Protector of the sincere and the steadfast. There is no God but Him, the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God and the One remembered in my heart! Thou seest Thy friends in the hands of the oppressors, and there hath befallen them in Thy days that which hath caused the hearts of all being, both seen and unseen, to melt. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Interlocutor spoke, and by the Staff that overcame the swords, by Thy Name, the All-Powerful, that Thou assist Thy chosen ones with Thy hosts that have conquered all who are in the heavens and earth, and by Thy signs which caused the Concourse on High, the Most Exalted Paradise, and those who circle round the Throne at all times to tremble. O Lord! Send down upon them from the heaven of Thy mercy the rains of Thy generosity and blessing. Strengthen their hearts with Thy power and their limbs with Thy might, lest they be frightened by the might of the aggressive ones among Thy servants and the polytheists among Thy creation. O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward the horizon of Thy grace and the ocean of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee not to disappoint them in what they desire in Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand thanks and praise be to the Purpose of the world that He confirmed that soul with a confirmation to which the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath testified, and that testimony sufficeth. The testimony of this servant and the like of this servant is not worthy of mention. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn His servants and loved ones with that which shall cause their names and remembrances to endure through the duration of the manifestation of His names and attributes. As for what thou didst write concerning the honored Haji Ibrahim and his son Aqa Qasim, upon them be the glory of God, it was presented before the Presence. His blessed and exalted Word: O thou who gazest upon the Face! We have heard thy call and accepted thy intercession. We have pardoned the first and We ask God to forgive him through His bounty and to remit his sins. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist Qasim in His remembrance and praise and the service of His Cause, and to enable him to forsake that which He hath forbidden and to act according to that which He hath commanded in His perspicuous Book. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him that he may be of the thankful, the doers. Rejoice, O messenger, in My grace toward them and My favor upon them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Through My remembrance the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of thy Lord’s pardon, the All-Merciful, wafted. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Muhammad Isma’il of the people of ?, upon him be the glory of God, who intends to make pilgrimage to the House of God. After this was presented, these manifest verses were revealed from the Mother Book. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Muhammad Isma’il! Upon thee be the glory of God! Turn thy face toward the House of God, the Lord of the glorious Throne. Draw nigh unto it with such devotion as will cause the fragrance of sincerity to be diffused among the servants and the sweet savors of thy love for the Lord of the worlds. Permission hath come from the direction of grace that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears. Thus hath surged the ocean of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, and He hath made mention of thee in such wise as to attract the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast been granted permission, and God willing, thou shalt attain unto that which thou hast intended. Were the servants to know and find the reward of attaining His presence, all would surrender their lives and whatsoever they possess that they might achieve it. This servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to assist him to perform such deeds as shall conduce to permanence and shall be the cause of His good-pleasure. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the heedless ones, that is, the deniers, and their opposition and hatred - in truth this servant is bewildered, nay the world is bewildered, for these souls were not present at the scene of the Cause and know not its foundation. All that was revealed in the Bayan beareth witness to this Cause - were it not for Him, the Point of the Bayan would not have appeared nor would the Bayan have been revealed. We beseech God to bestow justice upon the servants. The heedlessness of these souls and their lack of understanding hath reached such a point that while Mirza Yahya traveled with seventy people during the migration from Iraq, he nevertheless informed his followers that he was not with them, and those ignorant ones accepted this. Their ignorance hath reached such a degree that the people of the cities of knowledge are bewildered. For years this servant was with him by command, yet these heedless people never asked even one person to tell them, for the sake of God, what the truth was. And until now they know not from whom came the Tablets that were sent to the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. But they would know if they were fair, and would understand if they were truthful. The recompense of their deeds hath prevented their eyes and deprived their ears. Soon shall they see the consequences of their actions, then shall they find no helper. We beseech God to make them aware and to aid them in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention about Haji ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, that he came to that region to counsel and guide him who rent asunder the veil with the finger of might and power, and likewise concerning the mention of that beloved of hearts, Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be the glory of God and His loving-kindness - these matters were presented before the Desired One of the worlds. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen beareth witness to the grace of the All-Bountiful. There hath been sent down for him from the heaven of utterance that which, were it to be cast upon all things, would cause them to raise their cry. We make mention of him at this time in such wise as to cause the fragrance of divine knowledge to be diffused throughout all possibility. We beseech God to protect him and to assist him with the hosts of wisdom and knowledge, and to make him a standard of His name and a banner of His remembrance among the people. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath been named ’Ali, upon him be My glory. His deeds in the path of God have been accepted. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this at this moment, and He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O ’Ali! Blessed be thine ear for what it hath heard, and thine eye for what it hath beheld of the signs of God, and thy tongue for having uttered His beauteous praise. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, for having made me to know Thee and guided me to Thy straight and manifest path. I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of this world and of the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth praise and glorification unto him, and beseecheth from God that which will cause His Word to be exalted amongst His servants.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of the spiritual friend, his honor Aqa Siyyid Morta?a, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise the mention of his love, steadfastness, and what befell him - these matters were presented before the Throne. His word, exalted be His majesty and abundant be His favors:</p>
<p>O Morta?a! We testify that thou hast attained unto the pearls of wisdom and utterance which were treasured within My Most Exalted Pen, and in My days thou hast attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, and the Lord of the exalted Seat. We sent thee aforetime that which the books of men cannot rival, as beareth witness He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. There befell Us in the Land of ?a what caused those near unto God to weep. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of life from the hand of Thy bounty, and for having assisted me to recognize the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Source of Thy Cause, and for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I wish to be a servant to Thy Cause in all conditions and to speak Thy praise. Thou art He Who created me, taught me, made me to know Thee, and mentioned me time and again. I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy Revelation and by what lay hidden in the treasuries of Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. O Lord! The poor one seeketh the sun of Thy riches and the seeker the ocean of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the seas that surge in the hearts of Thy loved ones and by the fire that spoke forth from Thy Tree unto Thy call, to aid me to achieve that which will exalt me. Verily, Thou art the Munificent Giver. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O Morta?a! Be not grieved. The world hath ever been subject to change and alteration. Consider what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Verily, with difficulty cometh ease.” We beseech God to send down upon thee from the heaven of His mercy a blessing from Him and a favor from His presence, to adorn thee with the ornament of His might, and to ordain for thee that which will comfort thine eyes. He, verily, is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. There is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that he hath been and continues to be successful, for there hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen for him that which all the riches of the world cannot equal even a single letter thereof, nor ever shall.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write regarding thy stay in that land, excellent is what ye have done, and the pursuit of medical science hath also been accepted. He said: We beseech God to assist thee, aid thee, and make thy remembrance and medical practice a cure for ailments. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Bounteous.</p>
<p>This matter is most excellent, for engagement therein and association with the servants is a means of tranquility for souls and is beloved for the purpose of teaching. And if it be possible to maintain fellowship with some of the learned, this would be good, for it is a source of tranquility. We beseech God to assist thee in all that thou wishest and desirest […] the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali Pasha Khan, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, previously his petition was sent by the beloved servant Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Muhammad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory and favors, and a response is being sent down from the heaven of grace. And likewise you had mentioned Jinab-i-’Ali Akbar Khan, may God strengthen him - a blessed Tablet specifically for him is also being sent. If their capacity allows, bestow it that they may drink from its ocean of meanings. As per your request, Tablets are being sent specifically for each of those souls who are turned to the horizon of the Manifestation. God willing, may they attain unto them and act as befitting.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding Jinab-i-Aqa Khudabakhsh, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and his love and assistance - after it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Khudabakhsh! The Wronged One hath repeatedly made mention of thee. Praise be to God, thou art blessed with His grace, confirmed in service, successful in deeds, and distinguished by steadfastness. We beseech God to aid thee in that which causeth the exaltation of His Word and service to His Cause. We are with those who have arisen to serve the Cause and have aided their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take thou the chalice of immortality from the hands of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, then drink therefrom in spite of every ignorant remote one, every shameless opponent and every tyrannical transgressor. Verily We were with thee and heard thy call, thy turning and thy devotion. We beseech God to ordain for thee the best of what He hath revealed in His Clear Book. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Desired One of all the worlds.”</p>
<p>And likewise they mentioned Jinab-i-Hakim Lalihzar, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. Praise be to God, mention of him and Jinab-i-Aqa Khudabakhsh, upon them both be Baha’u’llah’s glory, was made in the Most Holy Court, and after this matter was presented, these verses were revealed specifically for him, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Lalihzar! Upon thee be My glory! We made mention of thee before and at this time. Give thanks to thy Lord for this manifest grace. The mention of all the world equalleth not His mention, nor do the books of all nations equal His Word. Know thou this and be of the thankful ones. Say: My God, my God! Thy mention of me transcendeth my station. This is naught but from the wonders of Thy grace and the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty. I testify that Thou art the All-Bountiful and that Thou art the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, then grant me the reward of attaining Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Almighty, and worthy to answer prayer.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant also conveys greetings to them and to Jinab-i-Aqa Khudabakhsh, upon them both be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and I seek confirmation. As to what you wrote about their steadfastness and service, this matter is truly in such days a great station and mighty deed. I beseech God for confirmation on their behalf. Verily He is the Confirmer, the Generous.</p>
<p>You mentioned Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Muhammad, may God strengthen him in what He loveth and is pleased with. After this was presented before His presence, these verses were revealed from the heaven of Will, blessed and exalted be His Word: […]</p>
<p>O Messenger! Upon thee be the glory of God, Lord of existence! Thou didst make mention of Sheikh Muhammad. We beseech God to aid him and grant him success, that he may arise with complete steadfastness to praise the Lord of Days amongst the people. Say: O Sheikh! By the Sun of Truth that shineth from the horizon of the prison sky, from the beginning of this Cause none were aware save two souls, and both have ascended. The knowledge is with God, thy Lord, the Lord of the worlds. We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe justice and equity, to read what hath been revealed and to reflect upon that which hath appeared. These are like two wings for man’s ascent to the goal. This Wronged One hath been in the hands of enemies from the beginning of this Cause until now - at times imprisoned, at others captive, at moments in chains. Yet at no time did He protect Himself. With complete power, steadfast reliance, and firm resignation, He summoned all on earth, from kings to subjects and others, to the Dawning-Place of supreme guidance and the Path of God, the Lord of all mankind. With utmost clarity We declared to the kings that which would ensure the healing of the world and the tranquility of nations. Neither the might of kings nor the clamor of subjects deterred Me. I spoke before their faces that which I was commanded by God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Thou thyself bearest witness to what hath been mentioned, and surely thou hast heard of the Tablet to the Sultan, which We sent forth openly through wondrous means. When it was presented before the Sultan’s face, the bearer raised the Book and proclaimed: “I have brought thee from the Most Great Announcement a mighty Book.” Likewise, We openly proclaimed the Cause to other monarchs and manifested God’s Command, such that now in every land the banner “Verily He is God” is raised and the standard “He doeth what He willeth” is unfurled. When the fragrance of the garment of utterance was diffused somewhat among the people of creation, certain ones emerged from behind the veils with swords, seeking to harm this Wronged One. Judge thou fairly, by God, O Muhammad! Were it not for Baha, who would arise among men? Were it not for Him, who would champion God’s Cause, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below? Who would make mention of Him among the enemies? We beseech God to aid thee in that which befitteth this blessed Day. Arise, detached from all save God, to celebrate His praise and glory. Observe the ocean and its waves, and likewise the Tree and its fruits. If today a tree should appear adorned with countless fruits, can one deny it? Or can one conceal the waves of the ocean? Nay, by God! Save those who have not drunk from the cup of fairness and are deprived of the ocean of justice. Now there hath been revealed and made manifest the equivalent of all divine Books of the past and future, nay more. By what proof and evidence did they believe in the Point of the Bayan? Today the path is manifest, the evidence revealed, and the Mother Book proclaimeth with loudest voice: “The All-Bestowing hath come!” Yet the people hear not, nor do they perceive. They cling to the river while deprived of the ocean. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, and with the finger of might rend asunder the veils and shrouds of the wicked.</p>
<p>Break asunder the veils of the wicked and rend them, and shatter the idols of vain imaginings through the power of the horizons’ Mighty One. By the life of God, the oppression of the oppressors has caused the reality of the Cause to be hidden from eyes and sight. Those who lived in perfect comfort and suffered no harm whatsoever in this Cause are now remembered as the oppressed ones - such is the condition of those who follow idle fancies. Let him reflect upon the Shi’ih sect and its divines. For twelve hundred years they claimed to hold fast to the cord of successorship, yet differences appeared regarding their stations and ranks, and to this day they curse one another. What was the fruit of those souls and what became of their recompense on the Day of Reckoning? What was the outcome of those twelve hundred years during which all the divines, from every pulpit, cursed and reviled the Truth, until finally they issued the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood? This is a matter which you yourself and other servants, if they speak truthfully, will confirm. And now some are occupied with organizing such a party. Say: Fear God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him through Whom the divine fragrances wafted, the sea surged, and the Dove of Utterance warbled in the Most Exalted Paradise upon the highest branches. O people of creation! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with a sovereignty that the might of princes, the denial of divines, and the clamor of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, have failed to intimidate. Say: Hear My call, then turn unto Him. Verily, the gate of bounty is opened before the faces of all in the heavens and the earth. Say: Beware lest the doubts of the people of the Furqan or the cawing of the people of the Bayan, who have violated God’s Covenant and Testament and denied Him of Whom the Herald declared “Verily, I am the first to worship Him,” prevent you. Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, that which ye possess will profit you not this day. Hearken unto that which the Bayan warbleth upon the branches. It said, and its word is the truth - and I have written its essence regarding His mention - “He is a sign that cannot be indicated by My indication nor by what was mentioned in the Bayan.” Fear God and follow not your desires. Behold the sun, its dawning and its effulgences and its lights, then the Tree and its fruits and its leaves. Beware lest the imaginings of men debar you from the truth. Cast behind you all else but God, then hasten with illumined hearts and radiant faces to the station wherein is raised the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the mighty throne. Beware lest ye withhold eyes from beholding the Most Sublime Horizon, or ears from hearkening to My sweetest call, or hearts from turning unto Him, or faces from directing themselves toward God, the Lord of all worlds. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of justice from the cup of My utterance and thou art seized with the intoxication of the Kawthar of My knowledge, say […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having shown forth the Path and sent down the verses, and for having guided me to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, the Dayspring of Thy commandments, and the Source of Thy laws. Thou didst cause me to hear Thy call while I was in the hands of Thine enemies, and didst manifest that which was hidden from the eyes of Thy servants and concealed in Thy knowledge. I testify that Thou didst remember Thy servants when they were silent in Thy remembrance, and didst turn toward them when they had turned away from Thy horizon. I testify that Thy mercy hath preceded all things and Thy grace hath encompassed all. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by Thy Name through which, when it shone forth from the heaven of Thy will, all names bowed down before it, and by Thy Command whereby Thou hast subdued the earth and the heaven, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee, to hold fast unto the cord of Thy grace, and to cling to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty. Then ordain for him who hath turned back and shown justice in Thy Cause the best of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mankind and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that mention hath been made of that distinguished one by the Supreme Pen. God willing, may the place be made ready for acceptance. God is the witness and testifier that this servant had for a long time desired to write something to him and reveal, for the sake of God and in His path, that which He knoweth, for the Trusted One, upon him be the glory of God, made favorable mention of him in the previous year, and likewise mention of him came from another quarter, and that distinguished one hath also made mention at this time. In any case, I beseech the Self-Sufficient, the Transformer of all things, and the Revealer of verses to confirm him that he may become a sign of His name in His lands. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>The Cause of God is more manifest than the sun and more exalted than the heaven. Every person of insight beareth witness and every hearing ear testifieth that from the beginning of creation until now no Revelation like unto this Most Great Revelation hath appeared or been made manifest. However, the unjust ones of the world, who are deprived of equity and forbidden from beholding, are striving with the utmost effort to conceal this world-illumining Sun. But alas! alas! The time shall come when new eyes and attentive ears shall appear through the Word of God, and they shall see all else but God as non-existent and shall turn unto the court of the One Beloved. O beloved of my heart! Until now no one hath comprehended the reality of the Cause. Were the details of the beginning of the Cause to be mentioned, all would hold fast unto the Straight Path and the Great Announcement.</p>
<p>Mirza Yahya was accompanied by seventy people during this journey. In their presence, he was unable to speak, yet the deluded ones, in their imagination, have denied this matter which seventy people witnessed. Such is the condition of the people. In the Land of Mystery, the power of God was manifestly revealed before the faces of a hundred companions who had gathered there. Who could speak in His presence? The tyranny of the Amir-Nizam became the cause of his name being elevated for the protection of the Source. If they would observe the signs of God with the eye of insight, detached from all else save Him, they would become aware of the root of the Cause. Then would the light of unity become manifest and every just one would testify to the power of God, His sovereignty, and His majesty which dominates all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>In any case, if you deem it advisable, convey greetings and praise on behalf of this servant. We beseech God, blessed and exalted is He, to assist him to manifest His Cause, detached from all else save Him, and to exalt through him His remembrance among His creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>They mentioned the names of his honor Aqa Siyyid ’Ali-Muhammad Khan and his honor Aqa Mir Siyyid Ahmad and his honor Aqa Mirza Murtada, upon them be the Glory of God, that they have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and have attained unto the sealed wine. Their mention was made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court and there was revealed for each one that which is the cause of the Greater Guidance and the Most Great Proof for the people of the mortal realm. God willing, they shall drink and receive their portion from the Kawthar of inner meanings and utterance that lie hidden within the words of the Desired One of all worlds. This servant also conveyeth greetings to each one and beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid them to perform such deeds as shall endure and persist in the Book of God. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. It is hoped that all the servants throughout the earth shall, through the breaths of inspiration, turn toward the horizon of the Manifestation of the Lord of all names and shall not be deprived of the Kawthar of utterance. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. In Him have we placed our trust and unto Him have we committed all affairs. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken unto your words concerning this Most Great Announcement. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from decline and transformation, change and obliteration, befitteth the Court of the Self-Subsisting One, Who hath summoned them that are endued with understanding unto the horizon of His Manifestation in their ultimate habitation. His favor hath encompassed the world of existence, both seen and unseen. His path is like unto a brilliant and luminous lamp, and His proof like unto the manifest and resplendent sun. The sweet waters of His utterance are the portion of them that thirst in the city of understanding. Glorified be His majesty and universal be His bounty! Glory be unto God that despite this, the blind have not seen - and praise be to God that they have not seen! The fewer the rivals, the sweeter and more pleasant is the work of the lovers.</p>
<p>O lovers! Come ye, come ye! The Beloved is manifest and rivals are scarce. Now is the time to take the cup of reunion from the hand of the Self-Sufficient One and, despite the servants’ opposition, to drink therefrom. A thousand pities and a hundred thousand regrets that while the Desired One is present and manifest without veil or concealment, yet the people of the world are some turned away, some bewildered, and some astonished. By what excuse do they excuse themselves? If they say divine proof is the Book, we present a hundred books. If they say it is explanation, in most books, scriptures and tablets hath been revealed that which every person of insight testifieth to the power and all-encompassing knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Would one possessed of insight be denied a drop from the Most Great Ocean, or a particle from the sun? What intoxication hath seized them all! By the life of our Object, the recompense of their deeds hath seized them all and barred them from the direction of the Divine Unity. We beseech God to grant awareness to the heedless and wakefulness to them that slumber. The forbearance of God, exalted be His glory, seeketh salvation for all. Verily He is the Most Merciful of them that show mercy and the Most Generous of the generous ones.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letter of that spiritual beloved arrived, from which wafted the fragrance of submission and contentment, and from which appeared the glad tidings of health and well-being. After its perusal and reading, it ascended to the Most Exalted Kingdom and, after permission was granted, attained the honor of being heard in the presence. This is what was revealed in reply, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed […]</p>
<p>This is a Book which the Wronged One hath revealed, wherein He giveth glad tidings unto the servants of God’s Kawthar, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Verily it is My utterance in the dominion of My knowledge. Blessed is he who hath heard and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and unseen!” The ocean of certitude hath surged at the right hand of the All-Merciful, and the fragrance of revelation hath wafted when the Ancient Beauty was established upon the throne of His name, the All-Loving. The worlds of wisdom and utterance have been illumined by the lights of the Sun of My manifestation, yet most of the people do not understand. They have denied that which hath appeared with truth and that which hath been sent down through grace, yet they perceive it not. They hear the verses of God and deny them, and they see His clear tokens and turn away from them. By My life! They are of those who have broken God’s covenant and His testament, and have abandoned that which they were commanded in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the call from the direction of the Prison. It will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of existence. Beware lest the hints of those who have turned away from the Truth and the doubts of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Kingdom, make thee sorrowful. Say: O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not every ignorant and veiled one. Behold ye and remember when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came with clear signs, the people denied Him and committed that whereby the pillars of the Word were scattered and the essences of existence lamented. Come ye and judge with fairness: By what proof did ye believe in God’s Messengers of old, and by what evidence do ye now turn away from the Truth, the Knower of things unseen, Who calleth aloud before the faces of all mankind: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the Promised Day!”</p>
<p>O people! Ye may produce what ye possess, and We shall set forth unto you the Word of God, the Almighty, the Beloved. Beware lest the books of the world hold you back from the Book of God which speaketh in this praiseworthy station. Say: By God! This is a Day wherein the Mother Book speaketh and all things proclaim: “The Promise is come, and in every matter the Promised One declareth: ‘There is none other God but Me, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.’”</p>
<p>Hearken unto the divine call in the Persian tongue, that perchance the heedless may become aware and the dead may attain eternal life through the sweet-scented stream of the All-Merciful’s utterance. Today the Sun of loving-kindness hath risen from the highest horizon of the world, and the Luminary of grace shineth from the zenith of the exalted heaven of the Most High Heart. It would be a pity should the servants remain deprived of the Ever-Flowing Source of truth on this day. The rain of mercy poureth down at all times, and the verses of grandeur are revealed throughout nights and days. Say: O ye dead ones! Today the Hand of bounty proffereth the water of immortality; deprive not yourselves thereof. The Sun of grace, through the blessed Greatest Name, bestoweth spiritual light; render not yourselves deprived. This Day hath no peer or likeness. Trusting in God, set your faces toward the supreme height and most exalted station, which is the recognition of God, exalted be His glory. Say: O My loved ones! Leave delusions to the deluded, and arise with firm steps to serve the Cause. We beseech God to assist you and reinforce you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. He is the Powerful One to Whose might the tongues of all beings testify. Blessed is the one whom the doubts of the worlds of conjecture and fancy have not held back from the lights of the Luminary of certitude. Through the Name of God, exalted be His glory, break down the barrier and rend asunder the veils that hinder, that ye may attain unto the pearls of the divine ocean of mercy. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>Make mention of the Wronged One to His loved ones and give them the glad tidings of the divine, heavenly Kawthar. Thy Lord is verily the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thou hast attained that which hath been the cherished hope of those near unto Him. Now, with patience, calm, forbearance and dignity, summon the servants to the horizon of divine knowledge. The conditions of that land and whatsoever hath occurred and shall occur therein are all manifest and visible in the presence of Him from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden. However, He hath repeatedly commanded that the attribute of the Concealer standeth before His face, beseeching, and likewise the attribute of the All-Patient. Therefore, for now these matters remain veiled. The end of all affairs is in the hand of our Lord - He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Praise be to God that that spiritual friend, after attaining His presence and meeting, was assisted in serving the Cause. Assuredly, whosoever ariseth for the sake of God and wisheth well for all the peoples of the world shall be aided by His invisible confirmations. That honored one hath been mentioned repeatedly in the Most Holy Court, and this servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that His favors may at all times encompass him and His grace assist him. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the petition of the honored friend, Aqa Muhammad-?adiq, upon him be the glory of God, was received and presented in the Most Holy Court, and one sacred Tablet was specifically revealed for him from the heaven of the Divine Will and dispatched. This servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him in remembering Him and serving His Cause. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. In truth, from his petition wafted the fragrance of love and steadfastness. How excellent is this! Praise be to God, he hath presented that which is befitting and likewise mentioned that which is requisite for faith and certitude. Verily, bounty is in the hand of God, our Lord and your Lord. He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whom He pleaseth, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto him who hath heard the Call and turned towards it, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings, for having manifested Thyself, revealed Thy verses and shown forth Thy clear tokens on a Day whereon the limbs of all names trembled for fear of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds.” O Muhammad-?adiq! Hear the Call from the Supreme Horizon - verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The servant who is present brought thy letter and presented it before the face of the Wronged One. We perceived from it the fragrance of thy turning, thy devotion, thy humility and thy submissiveness to this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped. Blessed be thy tongue, for it hath spoken the truth; and thy face, for it hath turned toward the lights of the Countenance; and thy heart, for it hath turned to the One, the All-Informed. When the intoxication of thy Lord’s utterance overtaketh thee and thou drinkest the Kawthar of proof from the cup of bounty and bestowal, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having awakened me through the breezes of the dawn of Thy manifestation and raised me up when Thy servants and creatures were thunderstruck. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will, and by the Word whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts of Thy loved ones, to make me in all conditions hold fast unto Thy will, cling to the hem of Thy decree, and be content with that which Thou hast ordained for me through Thy bounty and grace. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and detached from all else but Thee. Aid me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and to make mention of Thee and praise Thee in Thy dominion with wisdom and utterance. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Then assist me, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, to preserve what Thou hast given me through Thy bounty, and ordain for me that which shall be a solace to me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>
<p>All praise be unto God, thanksgiving be unto Him, power be unto Him, and authority be unto Him. He hath sent down from the heaven of His knowledge that which hath attracted the hearts of His creation. Man standeth bewildered before the greatness of His grace, bounty and mercy. We beseech Him to perfect our imperfect deeds, actions and words, and to adorn them with the ornament of acceptance. He is the Powerful, He is the Kind. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the letter of the honored brother, Haji Hasan Mi?ri, upon him be the Glory of God, which you sent to this servant arrived. Praise be to God, it was the cause of joy, gladness and delight, for it was adorned with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. After reading and reviewing it, it was taken to the Most Exalted Station, presented before His countenance, and attained the honor of His attention. One Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the Sacred Heaven specifically for him and was sent. God willing, may they drink from the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of all worlds, cup after cup and chalice after chalice, in spite of those who have denied God and His verses, turned away from His presence, and rejected what hath appeared from Him. And this is what was revealed for him from the heaven of bounty. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from the Wronged One to him who hath believed in God, the Lord of lords, that the Call may draw him to the Supreme Horizon and bring him nigh unto a station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: “There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Bestower.” The horizons have been filled with the signs of God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Meeting, yet most of the people are in doubt and dissension. O Hasan! Upon thee be My Glory. Hearken unto My Call from the direction of My prison. Verily, He will aid thee to make mention of Me and to praise Me, and will protect thee from the evil of Mine enemies who have fabricated lies against God, the Lord of all beings. We have brought forth from the treasuries of Our Most Exalted Pen before the faces of all peoples the pearls of wisdom and utterance, whereunto testifieth the Mother Book. The servant present hath presented thy letter and read it before Our face. We have revealed for thee that wherefrom the sincere ones will find the fragrance of God, the Lord of all religions. Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and turned towards Him when the people were in heedlessness and error. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and remind them of what hath been sent down for them from the heaven of grandeur and favors. We beseech God to aid thee to serve the Cause with utterances whereby hearts will be attracted and spirits transformed. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee, given thee success, and given thee to drink from the Kawthar of utterance that which the riches of all parties cannot equal.</p>
<p>In the Persian tongue, hear thou the divine call. By the life of God! Ears have been created and brought from nothingness into being for these days. God willing, mayest thou be set ablaze with the fire of the divine Lote-Tree with such an ignition that its effect will become manifest in the hearts of men. These days have been and are the days of the most great bounty and the supreme mercy. Blessed is the servant who hath arisen to serve the Cause with wisdom and utterance. He is indeed of the people of Baha in the Qayyum-i-Asma. To this testify the Books of God and beyond them every fair-minded and discerning one, and every knowing and informed one.</p>
<p>Glory be unto God! The ornaments of the world have prevented the peoples from the Most Great Name. All have testified and do testify to their transience; yet for the sake of two fleeting days, they have deprived themselves of eternal life and everlasting existence. Arise to serve the Cause, placing thy trust in God. Verily, He will assist thee and aid thee with the hosts of the seen and the unseen. Thy Lord, verily, is powerful over all things. Today the effulgences of the Sun of divine bounty have encompassed all, inasmuch as He hath strictly forbidden conflict, discord and strife in the Book. One must arise to aid the Cause of the Beloved of the worlds through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. This is the command of God, both before and after. Blessed are they that have attained!</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me clinging fast to Thee and to Thy Cause. Aid me in Thy service, then make my mention to have such effect, through Thy power, that it may guide hearts unto the Supreme Heart, through Whose fragrances the earth and heaven were attracted, and through a single one of Whose signs the Hour appeared with its tokens, and the Resurrection with its mysteries. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of them that have recognized Thee!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the breezes of His favor have enveloped them. God is witness and testifier that this servant has ever beseeched, in the court of the Goal of all the worlds, that which is sanctified above peer or likeness on behalf of the friends, and has specifically sought confirmation for them and strength to preserve what He has bestowed. Verily, He is the Most Powerful of the powerful and the Most Generous of the generous.</p>
<p>They must engage in assistance both night and day, and likewise in the refinement of souls and the reformation of the world. Surely you have heard of the shepherd in the Age of Ignorance who, though unworthy of mention, through turning to God became the bearer of mysteries and guide of the righteous. Similarly, the fisherman became possessed of heavenly mysteries - he who in previous Books was known as Peter and in the Arabic tongue as Simon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, praise be to God, they were recently adorned with the ornament of true forgiveness. Now they possess the station of one who came into the world through prayer, whom God has manifested through His grace and mercy. Some time ago, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to them. It beareth witness that our Lord and their Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Every person of insight and fairness knows that Hadi Dawlat-Abadi had no understanding whatsoever of the Cause from the beginning, and his heedlessness, misguidance and lack of comprehension reached such a point that he has lately busied himself with organizing a party like unto the Shi’ih party. It would be most fitting for someone to ask him what became of the previous party who for years considered themselves the most learned, most excellent, most noble and most understanding, and what was the fruit of their deeds on the Day of Reckoning, save that they committed that which became evident to the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and the inhabitants of the supreme Heaven - that they were the most lost among the peoples of the world. By the life of our Lord and your Lord, they committed that which causeth the eye of justice to weep and the Supreme Pen to lament. To this day the misguided divines of Iran curse the Truth from their pulpits. Such were the deeds of the Shi’ihs on the Day of Resurrection. Now that heedless one, bereft of understanding, occupies himself with mention of successor, chief, noble and the like, intending to establish for the hapless people a Jabulqa of suspicions, a Jabulsa of vain imaginings, and a region of falsehood. By the life of our Beloved and our Goal, it is incumbent and obligatory upon all souls to protect the servants from the evil of that heedless one, lest they be afflicted with fancies like unto those of the past. This servant beseeches God not to deprive any of His servants, nor prevent him and his like from the waves of the ocean of knowledge. The poor one is heedless and knoweth not that love of leadership hath seized him. During the Manifestation of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - love of rank and station deprived all the divines of that age from the Lord of all beings. They pronounced the decree of His death and martyred His followers in every city. They committed that which the Pen is ashamed to recount and the tongue to express. In these lands, one appeared by the name of Mahdi and none turned away from him. Now some hundred thousand souls have gathered around him although his true state is unknown. Yet when the Dawning-Place of divine verses and the Manifestation of the divine Self appeared in Iran, the divines gathered […]</p>
<p>And when the Manifestation of the Divine Being appeared in Iran, the divines gathered together and subjected Him to the gravest abasement and martyred Him. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! In these days, numerous letters have repeatedly arrived from the beloved of hearts, his honor Amin, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and in each letter mention was made of your honor and the honored one mentioned above, upon him be Baha’u’llah, and his honor Aqa Muhammad Isma’il and his honor Aqa ’Ali and other friends, upon them be Baha’u’llah, and he requested a Tablet for each one. Some time ago Tablets were revealed specifically for some and were sent, and now also in answer to the petitions they have been revealed, and those letters which they themselves had written have been dispatched, and concerning each one he requested bounty. All were presented in the presence of Him from Whose knowledge nothing escapes, and an answer was graciously given. All this is from His all-encompassing grace and His mercy that hath preceded all things. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned regarding his honor ’Abdu’l-Husayn Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, that which would ensure the perpetuity of his remembrance was previously revealed specifically for him and was sent to his honor Amin, upon him be Baha’u’llah, that he might forward it. This servant also conveys greetings to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist and grant success in preserving bounties that are without peer or likeness. Likewise, in response to the petition of his honor Haji ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, there was revealed that which is the spirit of life for the body of the world, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for his honor Aqa Muhammad Isma’il, upon him be Baha’u’llah. Well is it with them and joy be to them. It is hoped that they will be assisted and enabled to arise with perfect steadfastness and complete determination to spread the verses and teach the Word of the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Khudabakhsh, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God that he attained unto the traces of the Supreme Pen. Blessed is he and blessed are they whom the happenings of the world and its affairs have not prevented from God, the Lord of the mighty throne. After his name was mentioned before the seat of the world’s Purpose, these exalted words were revealed - exalted and blessed be His utterance: “O Messenger! The mentioned souls have been set ablaze by the fire of the blessed Tree and illumined by the light of the Cause. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to Khudabakhsh and give him the glad-tidings of the waves of the ocean of divine bounty. Today, whosoever hath turned to the most exalted horizon hath in that instant been encompassed by divine forgiveness. From all directions the realities of things secretly give him glad-tidings and congratulations, saying: ‘How excellent is thy state, for thou hast been adorned with the ornament of forgiveness and embellished with the crown of justice.’ Blessed are they that attain, and joy be to them that attain! The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of the worlds.” End quote.</p>
<p>The answer to each of the requests of that spiritual friend hath been revealed from the heaven of divine favor and sent forth. God willing, may ears and eyes be purified by the lights of the utterance of the Most Merciful, and may all give voice to the blessed words “Thine is the praise, O God of the world, and Thine is the glory, O Lord of names.” And finally, remembrance and glory and splendor be upon thee and upon whosoever heareth the Word and respondeth, for such a one is among the people of this noble station. Praise be to our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O spiritual beloved, his honor Afnan, Mr.&nbsp;Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, may the glory and favor of God rest upon him, may consider this:</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>The Hidden and Inaccessible One, glorified be His majesty and exalted be His grandeur, willed to manifest Himself and uttered the word “Be!” Whereupon the Point appeared, and from it emerged what was and what will be. His Books were detailed, bearing what lies in the unseen and the visible. These are the table of His knowledge and the bounty of His utterance, through which He breathed into all things His verses that caused hearts and souls to be attracted. Glory and splendor be upon the treasuries of the pearls of His knowledge and the repositories of the gems of His wisdom - those who have arisen to aid His Cause, detached from all else save Him, and holding fast to His cord for the spread of His commandments and laws. These are the people of Baha in the Book of Names, from the Lord of all beings, Who came from the heaven of mystic knowledge with wisdom and utterance. My spirit be a sacrifice for your mention and your words.</p>
<p>The sublime script, like the light of dawn, illumined the expanse of heart and soul and adorned the dwelling of existence. I beseech and implore the Truth, exalted be His glory, to assist that beloved of hearts to teach the Cause and spread its traces with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The Divine Knowledge was greatly delighted and boundlessly rejoiced at reading the letter. After its reading and recitation, it was taken to the Most Exalted Summit and presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, achieving the honor of His attention. This is what the Desired One hath revealed in this unfurled tablet. His word, mighty be His utterance and glorious His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, and in My Name, the Self-Subsisting […]</p>
<p>A mention from Us to the one who turned towards and attained the presence while most of mankind turned away - they who cast the Cause of God behind their backs, clinging to the cords of conjecture and fancy. The Light hath shone forth and the Sun hath risen and the Herald hath called out, yet the people remain in strange doubt. God created His servants for the recognition of the Dayspring of His signs and the Manifestation of His Self, yet they have cast aside what God intended, holding fast to the hem of their desires. They are indeed in heedlessness and error. The wine of vainglory hath so intoxicated them that they are debarred from that which profiteth them, turning instead to the source of tyranny and oppression.</p>
<p>We reared one of Our brothers and protected him beneath the canopies of Our grandeur. Yet when the Light shone forth he turned away from Us and arose in such oppression that the Pen lamented and the ink cried out. By the life of God, he sought to shed My blood, having been led astray by one of Our servants. When We departed from among them, he arose and uttered that which caused the tears of the righteous to flow. My soul is bewildered by his deeds, as are the Concourse on High, the exalted Paradise, and the companions of the Crimson Ark. To this the Mother Book beareth witness in the most exalted station.</p>
<p>God hath, through His power and sovereignty, transformed the prison into the Most Exalted Paradise. Say: O people, behold the power and dominion of God, how He opened the prison gate with the key of His Name, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful. The servant present before Us hath presented thy letter, and after permission was granted, We heard it and answer thee with these verses from whose horizons shine forth the suns of wisdom and utterance. We found from thy letter the fragrance of thy love and thy turning towards Us. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee with that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure in this station which God hath made the circling-point of the Manifestations of His signs.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have risen this day speaking thy name and mentioning that by which the hearts of the chosen ones were attracted. Take the chalice of eternity in the name of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, then drink therefrom despite the enemies, and say: Praise, glory, gratitude and splendor be unto God for having guided me to a Revelation that hath stunned the hearts of the wicked and strengthened me to turn towards Him through the means of the heavens and earth, until I came, attained His presence, heard His sweetest call and beheld His most glorious horizon. I beseech Him by the ocean of His bounty and the heaven of His giving to aid me in that which He loveth and is pleased with, lest there appear from me that which is unseemly. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned with my whole being unto Thee, turning away from all else besides Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause through which Thou hast subdued the world and the nations to send down upon me in all conditions that which will draw me nigh unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of deeds and hopes. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy bounty, turning toward the Kaaba of Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy Day wherein Thou didst blow the Trumpet and reveal the realities of all things and unite the hearts, to make me circle round Thy will in such wise that I shall not breathe except by Thy leave and Thy desire. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of one of the Afnan who hath been named Mirza – upon him rest My Glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy. We have, aforetime, exalted him and made mention of him in diverse Tablets, as a token of Our grace and as a gift from Our presence. Verily thy Lord doeth as He willeth, through His Name, the One Who hath dominion over all who are in earth and heaven. O Mirza! Upon thee be My Most Glorious Glory. Hearken unto the Call from the horizon of ’Akka. Verily, neither the treasures of the wealthy, nor the jewels of princes, nor the riches of the learned can compare with it. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Neither the tribulations of the world, nor its might, nor the denial of those who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the End could hinder Him. O Mirza! Take hold of the Book with the strength that cometh from Him, then act in accordance with that which thou hast been commanded by God, the Lord of Daybreak. We have exalted thee for My recognition and the service of My Cause. Cast aside what the people possess and take what We have sent down for thee from the most exalted Station. We desire to show thee a mighty measure of detachment, that We may make thee a door to this Cause, through which the Herald hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of Lords. Deprive not thyself of that which We have ordained for thee. Leave the people and what they possess. He commandeth thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. Give thou the glad-tidings of My remembrance to My Afnan, that the rapture of the verses may so seize them that neither the happenings of the world nor the oppression of those who have denied the Revealer of verses may cause them grief. Say: Fear not, neither be ye sorrowful. Arise from the horizon of the House with a sovereignty at whose manifestation all created things have bowed down. Say: We have exalted you and made mention of you in such wise as no mention can equal. Soon shall appear that which ye were promised in the Book. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O Afnani! We have desired to make mention of Afshar who has arisen to serve the Cause and hath spoken in praise of God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed be his tongue, and blessed be his heart for having turned towards My horizon, and blessed be his ears for having heard the verses of God, the Manifestor of clear proofs. Now We speak in Persian after the most eloquent tongue that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones. God, exalted be His glory, spoke two words to the Son of Imran on the Mount of Knowledge, and now He hath opened before thee a book and hath spoken that which is an everlasting treasure for thee. Strive that this station may not be effaced or altered. Thou hast indeed exerted great effort regarding Ali-Haydar, upon him be My Glory and My favor. In truth, noble services have appeared from him. It behooveth all to recognize the station of his services and to act as is befitting. His Honour Afshar, upon him be My Glory, hath truly well comprehended the degrees of knowledge of the Shi’ih. That which hath flowed from his pen hath been accepted before the Face. Glory be to God! The Shi’ih party have not had and do not have more than two words of truth, and that is their verbal confession of the Divinity and the Prophetic Mission. For one thousand two hundred years they played at succession, and finally martyred their Master with manifest tyranny. The Most Great Law and God, the Lord of the worlds, have lamented their oppression. In the days when they were engaged in service in the name of the Apostle of God - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - the Cause reached such a station that the tongues of those who praised were powerless to extol it and those who would enumerate were incapable of counting its virtues. But when they altered it and set about arranging partners, power was transformed into impotence and glory into abasement. The Exalted One - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - sayeth that the bodies of the Letters of the Living are at the station of the spirits of the former Imams. Observe ye the Bayan and make the people aware, that perchance they may not again become afflicted with vain imaginings. The station of the Letters of the Living is that of servitude, and they were created by a word, and one of those souls was Mulla Baqir. The purpose is that souls may attain to the lights of the Sun of true unity. Say: O Afshar! He Who is the Chosen One remembereth thee at this time even as He remembered thee before. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Expositor. Those souls who were not with Us and were unaware of the Cause, when they observed that the effulgences of the revelations of the lights of the Most Glorious Sun had somewhat illumined the world, they rushed forth from behind the veil with the swords of hatred, and now they are occupied with forming a party like unto the Shi’ih party. They have taken fancy as their lord besides God. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are among the most lost ones in My perspicuous Book. O Afshar! Upon thee be My Glory and My favor. Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison, then illumine the hearts of the world with the light of My Cause, the Dawning, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: O people of the earth! Come, that I may give you to drink of the Kawthar of utterance in the name of our Lord, the Most Merciful. Then hasten with illumined hearts to the horizon of the revelation of Him Who conversed on the Mount, in the prison of Akka. Beware lest the roaring of men frighten you, or the whisperings of those who have denied the Day of Judgment prevent you. We have remembered thee time and again with that whereby thy remembrance and thy name shall endure in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory shining forth from the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hear thy words concerning this Cause whereby the limbs of the polytheists have quaked with fear.</p>
<p>Verily We have made mention of the Alif and Fa, and We desire to make mention of him who was named Muhammad before Isma’il, that the sweet fragrances of God’s revelation, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, may attract him. O Isma’il! Behold and then remember those who turned toward the place of sacrifice in the path of God, the Lord of all beings, and who spent what they possessed of wealth and life in their longing to attain the presence of God, the Possessor of this exalted and glorious station. Say: O company of the heedless! Be fair in what hath been manifested in truth, and be not of the wrongdoers. Is Ashraf, who turned toward God and sacrificed himself in His path, better, or Hadi, who, when he heard the clamor, was disturbed and fear seized his limbs, and he ascended the pulpit and spoke that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament? By God! His life testifieth to his hypocrisy, while the ascension of the former beareth witness to his acceptance and his constancy, whereby bewilderment seized every servant who turned to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as the countenance of the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from His remote prison. Say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the world, for having caused me to hear Thy call and to behold Thy signs, and for having enabled me to draw nigh unto Thee through the means of the heavens and earth. I beseech Thee, by the ocean of Thy Most Bountiful Name, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through Thy mighty and wondrous command.</p>
<p>Verily We desired to make mention of him who was named Ibrahim and give him the glad-tidings of God’s bounty and generosity, and We counsel him with that which will draw him nigh unto a station wherein the atoms proclaim: The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Almighty. O Ibrahim! From the beginning, heedless souls remained concealed from manifest authority and were occupied with their own protection, but when the divine light shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Lord’s will, they emerged from behind the veil and brought about that which hath no equal. Say: My God, my God! Aid the heedless to be fair in Thy Cause and to be just concerning what hath appeared from Thee, and enable them to return to the gate of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>It endeth with praise unto God. The honored nobleman, His Holiness the Afnan, Haji Siyyid Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, hath from the beginning until now been successful in serving the Cause and hath held fast to the mighty cord of God, and hath been mentioned and continues to be mentioned in the Most Holy and Exalted Court of the Desired One of all worlds - may the spirit of all who are in the kingdoms of Command and Creation be a sacrifice unto Him. When his luminous letter arrived mentioning the funds that remained with His Honor the deceased and martyred one who was martyred in the path of God, Haji Shaykh Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, he had written that the honored deceased one himself knew it was not our money, so now what answer shall we give to its owners? Henceforth no one will come near us. After this matter was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court of our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in earth and heaven, these exalted words shone forth from the dawning-place of the heaven of divine favor - mighty is His utterance and glorious His proof […]</p>
<p>O servant present! Write to his honor Afnan, upon him be my Baha and my loving-kindness: You made no mention of the affairs of Beirut and Constantinople, and from the beginning no permission was sought nor consultation undertaken, despite all being commanded to this. Nevertheless, the sum of six hundred and seven Ottoman liras which was the House’s funds and was present was delivered to his honor Afnan, upon him be my Baha and loving-kindness, for him to send. Verily, were He to wish, He could pay the debts of the world. Thy Lord is indeed the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. Read the Tablet of Ra’is and the Tablets to the Kings that thou mayest be assured that all affairs are in His grasp - He turneth them as He pleaseth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Grieve not over anything. Place thy trust in all matters in God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Hold fast unto that which We have commanded thee, then act according to what We have imparted unto thee before and after. Verily We desire thee and love thee and command thee to that which shall profit thee in the Hereafter and in this world. To this testifieth that which hath appeared from Me before the faces of princes and sovereigns.</p>
<p>In truth, after the arrival of His missive, whatever was outwardly possible, He commanded its execution. His honor Afnan, the venerable Haji Siyyid Ali and his honor Aqa Mirza Muhsin, upon them both be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, are aware of what transpired and remained undisclosed. The favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, towards his honor exceed the reckoning of this servant and others. I beseech Him and implore Him to open the gates of grace, bounty and generosity with the key of the Most Great Name, and to assist his honor to act according to that which he is commanded. It is hoped that He will illumine and purify the hearts and souls so that whatever has been and is being submitted may be answered. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Afnan, the venerable Haji Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious. In truth, he has been and is deserving of the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory. His love and devotion are firm and steadfast. And after his mention was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of grace. He says, exalted be His utterance and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who dominates all names […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad, O Afnan! Upon thee be My mercy and My glory! We have mentioned thee before in verses through which the fragrance of bounties and favors was diffused, and We make mention of thee at this time in such wise as will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. I bear witness that thou wast remembered before the Wronged One in the nights and days. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Generous. We remember thy presence, thy meeting, and thy standing before the Gate. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of thy Lord. He witnesseth, seeth and heareth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We make mention of the Afnan - upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness - and give him the glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for him by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. By the life of God! That which hath been ordained for him cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the world. He Who possesseth the knowledge of all things in a clear Book beareth witness to this. We beseech God to open before his face the doors of grace and bounty. He, verily, is the Almighty over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of the Leaves who have been blessed by that which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. We testify that they have turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon and have heard His sweetest call when it was raised from the Prison of Akka, and they have attained unto that which was inscribed in the Tablets of God, the Lord of this resplendent Day. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have not broken My Covenant and My Testament, and who have testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: Verily there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This servant also conveyeth greetings to them and to the friends. God is witness and testifier that the honored ones and friends are ever mentioned by tongue and recorded by pen. Their remembrance and love have not left the heart, nor will they ever. Their mention hath another effect and another fruit. They are the trees in the garden of God’s remembrance. I beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to send down from the clouds of grace and heaven of bounty that which will cause their exaltation and elevation.</p>
<p>My God, My God! Let not these fruits fall from the Tree, and in every moment bestow the water of bounty. Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower, the All-Knowing. Bounty and giving are in Thy grasp. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious. Glory and mention and praise be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Goal and your Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>O Jinab-i-Haji Mirza Muhammad Afshar, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In Dhi’l-Hijjih 1302</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>In truth, today praise and glorification befit the people of fidelity, whom neither the clamor of the heedless, nor the croaking of the croakers, nor the doubts of the polytheists, nor the insinuations of the opposers could debar from the manifest light. Although the effulgent rays of the Sun of Revelation have encompassed the world and His verses have adorned cities and lands, and in every direction the Standard of His Revelation has been raised aloft and from every quarter the voice of the One Who conversed on Sinai can be heard, yet again some of the heedless have returned to their first step. Glory be to God! The Finger of Power rent asunder the veils and tore away the shrouds, yet still the croakers seek anew to afflict the hapless people with veils thicker than those before and shrouds greater than those of old. They are worshippers of vain imaginings yet count themselves among the people of unity; they are idol-worshippers yet consider themselves among those endowed with true knowledge.</p>
<p>Man is bewildered, for all have witnessed with their own eyes and heard with their own ears that whatsoever the Shi’ih sect formerly uttered and occupied itself with was mere fancy and sheer delusion. Throughout ages and centuries they pronounced curses and maledictions against one another from their pulpits, to such extent that the veins of their necks stood out like spears. When the dawn of the Will of the Lord of Oneness broke and the Sun of Truth shed its radiance, all, whether learned or ignorant, arose in the first year against the Lord of all beings, in such wise that the dwellers of the highest Paradise lamented. Finally, that unjust group issued the decree and arose to shed His pure blood, until that which caused the very essence of truth to weep came to pass.</p>
<p>This was naught but the fruit of their unworthy deeds and false actions. Now the people of the Bayan, namely those souls who have turned away, should with fairness and justice reflect upon the end of those who considered themselves the most exalted of nations - what fruit those souls reaped, that these souls should now walk in their footsteps. God protect us and you from the evil of such people! In truth these souls are heedless, for they have not been informed of the root of the matter and do not inquire of those who are aware. It behooveth me to mention that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an. His exalted Word: “Leave them to plunge in their idle discourse and play.” And prayers and peace and glory and praise be upon those who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness in such wise that they have cast the world behind their backs, standing firm in the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. And praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of all who know and the Beloved of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the mysteries have been revealed, the rivers have flowed, the banners of unity have been planted, and the standards of detachment have been raised! I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst create all beings and bring forth all existences, to acquaint Thy servants with that which will profit them in every world of Thy worlds, and teach them that which they have neglected concerning Thee in Thy days. I testify, O my God, that Thou hast made clear the Path, brought forth the Evidence, sent down the Verses, and manifested the Proofs. Blessed is the soul that hath discovered the fragrance of Thy verses, turned unto Thee, hastened to Thy supreme horizon–the Station wherein naught is mentioned save Thyself, O Lord of all beings and Sovereign of the earth and heaven. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the effulgences of the lights of the sun of Thy grace, to aid Thy heedless servants to return to the court of Thy glory and to enter the precincts of Thy grandeur. O Lord! Disappoint them not through Thy bounty and generosity, and deprive them not from the heaven of Thy bestowals. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, to assist Thy party who have not broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and who have arisen to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee and to serve Thy Cause, to manifest that which Thou hast and which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book, that perchance thereby the slumberers may awaken and return unto Thee and hold fast unto the cord of Thy bounty and cling to the hem of the robe of Thy forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful, the Generous One.</p>
<p>The letter from that honored one reached this evanescent servant some time ago. It was a conscious testimony and a true witness to that honored one’s orientation toward and acceptance of the Supreme Horizon. How excellent was the fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds that wafted from it. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from God, exalted be His glory, that this fragrance may ever continue to waft and this breeze to blow. After its reading and review, it was taken to the Most Exalted Station and, following permission, was presented before His countenance and was honored to be heard. His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>In My Name that shineth forth from the horizon of the Kingdom of proof […]</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon! A servant presented thy letter before the Countenance and read it. Each word thereof bore witness to and indicated thy turning and devotion. We beseech God to aid thee in such wise that thou mayest safeguard the people from the delusions of the barking ones. By My life! They are engaged anew in building cities and abodes of doubts and vain imaginings. Detached from the world, arise to educate the peoples. Marvel not at this word, for this is not difficult for God. Make great thy resolve and occupy thyself with service. Today the Most Great Gate is opened, the Sea of Revelation is surging, and the Speaker is speaking. Reflect upon the baseness of the souls of those who have turned away. God hath manifested the banners of verses and the hosts of revelation and inspiration from the horizon of the heaven of Will, clear and evident and manifest, and there hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen the equivalent of all the heavenly Books, nay more. Yet they are occupied with former vain imaginings and speak the words of the gathering of the Mother City. If they deny this Most Great Cause and Most Great Announcement, to what cord will they cling and to what rope will they hold fast? This Wronged One arose to promote the Cause in days when all hearts and souls were agitated and the limbs of the people of the Bayan trembled from the might of rulers and the clamor of divines - an arising to which all bear witness - and called all, with the most loud voice, to the Most Exalted Horizon. Nevertheless, there proceeded from the wayward souls that which caused the dwellers of the cities of inner meanings and utterance to weep. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In any case, beseech the Dayspring of generosity, the Treasury of bounty, and the Dawning-Place of divine mercy that He may aid the heedless servants to return, that perchance they may arise to retrieve what they have lost. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and My turning toward thee from the direction of My distant prison. We have sent down for thee aforetime, and at this moment, that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and utter not that which the ancients did not utter. Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the servants. By God! He Who was hidden in the eternity of eternities hath appeared and there hath been sent down that which was treasured in the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The banners of proof have appeared and before them have bowed down the signs of all existence. To this beareth witness He Who proclaimeth that there is none other God but Me, the Wronged One, the Stranger. Take thou the cup of mystic knowledge in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in spite of the people of the Bayan who have broken God’s Covenant and Testament and have arisen in clear opposition. Thou hast been mentioned before the Countenance. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve this glorious and elevated station. Convey My greetings to the faces of those whom God hath related to thee and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance of them in My Most Great Prison, and remind them of that which hath been sent down from the kingdom of My wondrous utterance. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon those who have quaffed the wine of steadfastness from this cup before which the seas have bowed down, and who have held fast unto this cord whereby the near ones have held fast. Praise be to God, the Lord of what was and what will be.</p>
<p>In the Name of the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful</p>
<p>This servant, nay all things, are bewildered and astonished, for it is observed that the very means whose corruption was evident yesterday are again today being grasped and clung to. Would that the people knew! An assembly in Manshad, like unto the assembly of the Mother of Cities, nay greater and mightier, has arisen in protest. They have written a letter, signed and sealed by four persons, and dispatched it. Glory be to God! Have these souls not seen the Tablet to Ra’is? Have they not read the Tablets to the Kings? Have they not heard of the Most Holy Book? All these matters were revealed aforetime from the Most Exalted Pen with utmost clarity. After receiving the letter, this servant remained bewildered for a time. On the one hand, it was observed that this letter was not worthy of presentation, and on the other hand, it was considered that perhaps concealing it might constitute a dereliction. Therefore, placing complete trust in God, this servant turned toward the Most Holy Court, and after receiving full permission, presented it in its entirety. An answer descended from the heaven of divine will. It is hoped that you will be blessed to review it. A hundred thousand regrets that this party has failed to comprehend that which befits the Day of God. And concerning the mention that was made of those who are related, each one has been mentioned in the Most Holy Court and has attained the outpourings of the true Bestower of Bounty. After the presentation of this matter, these exalted words descended from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance. He - exalted be He - speaks: […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward the Most Sublime Horizon! We have heard thy remembrance and praise, and witnessed thy turning and devotion to God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed is the ear that hath attained to hearing the Call, and the eye that hath beheld the Most Sublime Horizon, and the hand that hath taken what was sent down from the heaven of the bounty of thy Lord, the Possessor of all necks. The Books of God have testified to this Book which hath spoken before the face of the world that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. They who cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to vain imaginings and idle fancies, are indeed lost. Say: By God! The hearts of the sincere have been attracted by the verses sent down from the heaven of grace. Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and be not of those who disbelieved when the All-Merciful came with power and sovereignty. All that ye heard hath appeared from the horizon of My will, and the Sun of proof hath shone forth from this Station which God hath made the point round which circle the Concourse on High and they who circle the Throne at eventide and at dawn. Say: Beware lest the doubts of the people debar you from the truth, or the allusions of those who were heedless of the Cause prevent you, for they followed every doubting idolator. How many a learned one hath been debarred from the Kawthar of life, and how many an ignorant one hath heard, hastened, and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of the verses!” How many a servant hath turned away from the Countenance, and how many a handmaiden hath heard and answered her Lord, the Guardian over all who are in the heavens and the earth. Bounty is in His right hand, and justice in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Commander through Whose command the Sun of power hath shone forth from the horizon of might. Thus hath the water of life flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath taken and drunk thereof, and woe unto every irreligious deceiver - they who have broken God’s covenant and His testament, and denied Him in Whom they believed. These are indeed of those who have gone astray. The Names whom God hath associated with thee have appeared before the Wronged One, and We have sent down for each one of them that whereby those near unto God shall perceive the fragrance of the bounty of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. Remember them on My behalf and give them glad tidings of that which hath been revealed for them - that which shall never perish, as long as My Most Beautiful Names endure. He Who possesseth knowledge of the Book beareth witness to this. We counsel them to manifest supreme steadfastness and to observe that which beseemeth the days of their Lord, the Lord of Return. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have shattered the idols of idle fancy through the power bestowed by God, the Manifester of clear tokens.</p>
<p>His is the praise and the favor, and His is the bounty and providence. His bounty is more manifest than the sun in mid-heaven; His grace is evident and His providence is radiant, such that this evanescent one needeth not make mention thereof. Would that heedless servants would observe with the eye of fairness and the ear of justice that which hath been revealed and made manifest, and would ponder thereon. This is that state of meditation of which they have said: “One hour’s reflection is preferable to seventy years of pious worship.”</p>

<p>He is the Speaker before the faces of the world</p>
<p>O Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all names. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of the worlds. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness from the Most Sublime Horizon that thou hast spoken the truth and testified to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth - that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou hast spoken that which caused the limbs of the polytheists to quake and the hearts of those who denied God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, to tremble. Blessed be thy tongue for having spoken the truth, and thy heart for having turned to the One, the All-Informed. Be confident in thy Lord’s favor such that neither the doubts of the divines and jurisprudents disturb thee, nor the might of princes frighten thee, nor the intimations of the people of the Bayan who have turned away from the All-Merciful and committed that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament, prevent thee. Say: O people of the Bayan! Cast the names behind you, turning unto the ocean of inner meanings which surgeth before your faces and from whose waves is heard “The Truth hath come with manifest sovereignty.” Thus warbled the Dove of Paradise upon the bough of eternity by the command of God, the Mighty, the Great. Say: O people of God! This Day is your day. Arise to aid the Cause of your Lord through wisdom and utterance. By God! The King hath come with a Cause against which neither the hosts of the world nor the might of kings and sovereigns can stand. Say: By God! He hath come for the reformation of the world and the purification of all peoples through this water which hath flowed from His Most Exalted Pen in this mighty, impregnable station. Thus hath the Tree of Knowledge yielded the fruits of utterance, each by My wondrous permission.</p>
<p>O Rida! Upon thee be My Glory! That which thou didst speak before all faces and didst send to the Most Holy Court was the truth, without doubt. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the lights of the Sun of Truth and hast drunk from the sealed wine. However, now the Most Exalted Pen counseleth concealment and protection, and that which wisdom requireth in all circumstances. We have forbidden the people of God from that which is prohibited and commanded them to that which is good. Nevertheless, until now the people of the earth have not understood what is intended and what is desired. Glory be to God! The people of the Bayan are seen today as the most lost among the peoples of the world. For one thousand two hundred and more years the Shi’ih sect clung to vain imaginings and held fast to idle fancies, and when the pavilion of glory was raised upon the highest of standards and the banner of “Verily I am God” was hoisted upon the most exalted station, they committed that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise to lament. Now the people of the Bayan are secluded in those same vain imaginings. The fruit of this people will surely be like the fruit of that people. Ask thou God to aid them to return. Verily He is the Ever-Turning, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends in that land and counsel them to steadfastness. Say: Open your eyes and purify your ears, for this is the Day of sight and hearing. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have clung to the hem of the robe of their Lord’s bounty, the Lord of Return.</p>
<p>That thou hast made mention of the hoopoe - the grace of God hath encompassed all, and His mercy hath taken precedence. Convey greetings on behalf of the Wronged One to him and say: O my handmaiden! We have made mention of thee aforetime in such wise as no mention can equal. God willing, thou shalt be confirmed. That which the Wronged One seeketh from all is the preservation of their own stations. All must adorn themselves with the ornament of truthfulness, sincerity, trustworthiness, righteousness, and chastity. This is the counsel of God, both in the past and in the future. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning one. Today is the day of the most great bounty. The True One, exalted be His glory, beholdeth it. O Rida! The Lord of Names declareth: Beseech the True One that He may manifest from His party that which beseemeth His Day and is worthy of His Revelation. The command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>The petitions of the leaf, the wife of the late Haji Mirza Hasan, upon them both be the Glory of God, were received and attained unto His presence. Make mention of her in such wise as shall gladden her eyes. Likewise the leaf Farkhundih, upon her be the Glory of God. We beseech God, exalted be He, to confirm them both, to grant them success, and to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. His is the praise at the beginning and the end. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>Let His Holiness Ism-i-Jud, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, send this to Aqa Rasul from the land of R.Sh., upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. 21 Ramadan 1305</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be fitting and worthy of the Desired One Who created through utterance, attracted through speech, and adorned assured hearts with the ornament of a wondrous new life through His blessed Word. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon His loved ones who held fast to the cord of service, achieved steadfastness, spoke with wisdom, and acted according to what was commanded by God, the Lord of the mighty throne. These are servants whom God has described, before and after, in His perspicuous Book. They are those who drank the choice wine of utterance from the cup of our Lord the Merciful’s bounty and succeeded in guiding humanity to the straight path.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of my heart, at this hour, being ten o’clock on the twenty-first day of the blessed month of Ramadan, the letter of the spiritual beloved Aqa Rasul, upon him be the glory of God, which he had written to that beloved one and sent, was presented before the Desired One of all worlds. After its presentation, these exalted words were revealed - may my spirit be a sacrifice for His bounty:</p>
<p>O servant in attendance! The words of Rasul have proven effective. From his acknowledgment and confession, the stars of favors have risen and the suns of grace have dawned. Praise be to God, he has mentioned that which has been and will be the cause of awakening for all souls, before and after. It is hoped that, having been purified and enkindled by the water of the utterance of the Desired One of all worlds and by the fire of the Sacred Tree, they will arise with their whole being to serve the Cause of the Lord of existence. O Rasul, upon thee be My glory! Thou hast spoken the truth that it is the twenty-first of Ramadan. The people of Iran, male and female, learned and ignorant, are occupied in mosques, temples and gatherings with praising the Successor and cursing Muradi, save whom God willeth. Reflect upon the heedlessness of that party, unaware that each one of those souls has been and is a hundred thousand times more wretched, more rebellious, more remote and more astray than this Muradi, for the Lord of the worlds drank the cup of martyrdom by the decree of those souls, and still they occupy themselves with cursing and reviling the Truth and His companions. Mentioning the Successor and acknowledging him becomes the cause of the exaltation of rank and station, not the cause of unbelief, for if unbelief appears from lack of understanding and acknowledgment, the proof of unity would seem impossible. In any case, the ignorance of people has been and is a barrier to speech. We beseech God to assist all in what He loves and is pleased with. Praise be to God, thou hast attained, seen and heard. Now thou must associate with the servants in that land with complete steadfastness, wisdom and utterance, that perchance thereby a matter may come to pass. That land is ready. In truth, if a patient and detached one be found, it will become the cause of the guidance and turning of heedless souls. This is not difficult for God. We mention the friends and counsel them to justice, fairness, religious devotion, trustworthiness and the fear of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>In truth, the letter of your honor, after being presented, became the cause of the manifestations of bounties. Well done to you and congratulations! God willing, you will settle in that land and kindle and remind the servants with the fire of God and His light. At one time, this exalted word was revealed from the Tongue of Him Who revealed the verses: “Ask God to assist His loved ones to hold fast unto that which will sanctify the soul and exalt His Word.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, from your pen was manifest determination, and evident was your attention and devotion. God willing, you will attain to that which you have intended and that which you have desired for the sake of God. The servant beseeches God, his Lord, to assist you, grant you success, and aid you. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy of answering prayers. Glory, remembrance, and praise be upon you and upon those who hear and acknowledge that which hath been sent down from God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>

<p>He is the All-Hearing, the Speaking, the Answering One!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who was established upon the throne of Sinai and spoke the Word whereby He set up the path and laid down the balance and blew the trumpet, whereat all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save those whom the veils of the world did not prevent, nor the clouds of the nations hinder, nor were they frightened by the might of princes, nor weakened by the power of those who denied the Lord of Names. They all turned with their whole being to the Supreme Horizon and spoke that which caused the limbs to tremble of those who turned away from the Truth and denied the final return. This is the Day wherein appeared that which was inscribed in the Tablet and concealed from eyes. Glorified be He through the movement of Whose finger all created things were set in motion, and through Whose will all beings cried out and glorified in His name, their Creator, at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>O Alif Ha! Hearken unto the voice of Him Who hath been wronged. He hath come with His name, the Self-Subsisting, and called all to the sealed wine. Among the people are those who heard and hastened and answered and drank in His name, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. And among them are those who denied God’s Cause and rejected His favor and spoke that which made the clouds to wail. And among them are those who pronounced sentence for the shedding of His blood through injustice whereat tears were shed and the hearts of the righteous were consumed.</p>
<p>O thou who speaketh My praise and standeth in service to My Cause! We have sent down for thee, both before and after, that whereby grace descended and the clouds rained down. We testify that thou hast drunk the wine of faithfulness from the hand of bounty and hast attained unto that which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen and inscribed in the Scriptures and Tablets. We beseech God to make thee a standard of His name and a banner of His remembrance, and to give thee to drink from the Kawthar of life at all times. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thus hath the ocean of grace surged and the fragrance of God, the Lord of lords, wafted. When thou hast attained unto My verses, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee for having enabled me to turn towards Thee when the men turned away from Thee–they who cast Thy Cause behind their backs and took their vain imaginings as lords besides Thee. O Lord! Thou seest me turning away from all else but Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom and the suns of the horizons of Thy utterance, and by the light of Thy Cause whereby Thy earth and heaven were illumined, and by the pearls hidden in the shells of the ocean of Thy power, to make me in all conditions detached from all else but Thee and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy pardon and generosity. Thou seest, O my God, the supplicant standing before the door of Thy favor with hands raised toward the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him, by Thy bounty through which existence itself came to be, and by Thy generosity which hath preceded the world and the nations. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bounteous, the Most-Generous, the All-Gracious, the Powerful, the Strong, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O thou who standeth in My service, who maketh mention of My praise, and uttereth My command! Upon Muhammad, My glory and loving-kindness rest! Throughout the nights and days thou hast dwelt secure and at rest beneath the canopy of loving-kindness. Time and again hath mention been made of thee, and that which hath streamed from the Pen of submission, contentment and steadfastness hath been dispatched unto the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God, thou art illumined by the light of recognition and art remembered by the Name of God, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to open before thy face the gates of bounties and favors, and to make thee a leader of the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are held the reins of all affairs. Convey unto the loved ones the greetings, glorification and glory of the Wronged One. We beseech God that He may, at all times, cause all to attain unto that which is the cause of eternal salvation and everlasting remembrance. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Wise. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>The honored Afnans, upon them rest all My glory, the Most Glorious, arrived in Beirut and, afterwards, by Our leave, gradually and individually arrived here. Having entered the canopy of Our favors and might, one by one they returned. Regarding what had happened, they stated that their plan was that, after arriving in Beirut, Siyyid ’Ali would return to Shiraz to accompany the exalted leaf to this land of God. They stated that they had designed the plan in this way because they feared going to Shiraz any earlier might provoke the foes and enemies to act and prevent all from attaining Our presence. It was even asserted that, despite such caution, the enemies caused disturbances along the way; but creation, protection, and liberty are all in the hands of God, and He is the All-bountiful, the All-generous. In short, such excuses were heard from one after another. But the Lord hath knowledge of all things; He is the All-knowing, the All-informed. Nevertheless, it would have been best [if they had] carried out the wishes of the illustrious exalted leaf, as this was most pleasing and acceptable to God; but it was otherwise ordained. The One True God is My witness! Our heart hath melted in agony that she was deprived of this pilgrimage, and all the dwellers under the tabernacle of purity and might are most sorrowful and despondent. At one point, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these exalted words: “O ’Abd-i Hadir! The effect of what hath happened may well appear on earth.” More recently, this utterance was spoken by His blessed Tongue: “Write to My Afnan [who had promised to escort the Bab’s wife] that we agreed and consented to the exalted leaf’s request. Currently, the honored persons continue to stand ready and prepared to fulfil that promise, though they have not spoken of it.” He further stated, “Write of this matter to the Afnan, upon him be the glory of God, as he was well aware of such a promise beforehand. We desired to fulfil what We had assured the exalted leaf.”</p>

<p>O thou who walkest in the path of love and drinketh from the cup of mercy! Know that thy letter hath reached Us, and We have understood the signs of thy love and the expressions of thy sincerity contained therein. We have become aware of thy state and how the fire of longing hath seized thee and how thou art consumed by the days of separation from the presence of thy Beloved, even though He is with thee at all times. If thou seest Him, then blessed art thou, and if thou seest Him not, verily He seeth thee. If thou knowest Him, thine eyes are gladdened, and if thou knowest Him not, yet He knoweth thee in thy turning and thy resting-place, and He is never heedless of thee nor will He forget thee. He heareth thy cry and thy whispered prayer.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning niyaz (offering), know thou that thy niyaz is thy love for the lights of Beauty, thy arrival at the shore of the ocean of Glory, and the purification of thyself from all idle talk concerning that which proceedeth from the people of Glory, that the holy breezes may waft over thee and bring thee to the sanctuary of Oneness, where thou mayest find the fragrance of love from the garment of the Self-Subsisting One. This is the essence of niyaz for everyone who hath attained and entered these gardens. Apart from what We have mentioned, nothing will avail, even if all who are in the heavens and on earth were filled with red gold and white silver. And all that thou hast heard concerning niyaz in the principles of the chosen ones was naught but for the manifestation of the love of the Beloved towards the lover, and the appearance of the sincerity of the lover towards the Beloved, that the severance of the servant towards his Lord and his following of Him in his life to come and in this world might become evident. Otherwise, they are sanctified from the world and its ornaments and its adornments, and are purified from all that pertaineth unto it and is ordained therein, for they soar in the atmosphere of holiness and dwell in the pavilions of the spirit. The accidental circumstances do not seize them, nor do the limited hearts in the realms of earthly dominion comprehend them.</p>
<p>Therefore, immerse thyself in this ocean which hath flowed from the direction of the ink that thou mayest find the fragrances of love and become aware of the mysteries of love in the beginning and the return. Then know that We have accepted from thee thy niyaz and have found in thy supplications that which is not befitting to mention. We beseech God to provide thee with the wine of immortality which hath gushed forth from the springs of glory, that its intoxication may attract thee and its stupor may seize thee - and this is an intoxication that will never pass away nor change eternally.</p>
<p>The one drunk with wine awakens from the west wind,</p>
<p>But the one drunk with Truth awakens not even from the trumpet of resurrection.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy Command, before which nothing that hath been created in earth or heaven can stand, and by the light of Thy countenance which hath encompassed all things, and by Thy most sweet call amongst the people of creation, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty and the clouds of Thy grace upon Thy creation and Thy creatures that which will adorn them with the ornament of certitude and draw them nigh unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all worlds.

Thou seest those who have held fast to the cord of Thy obedience and clung to the hem of Thy commandments, and who have arisen to make mention of Thee and to serve Thy Cause, and have spent what Thou hast given them in Thy path. These are they whom Thou hast described in Thy glorious Book with Thy most mighty, most great and most sublime words: “and who prefer others before themselves, though poverty be their portion, and such as are preserved from their own avarice - these are they who prosper.” O my Lord! Write down for them both from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw them nigh unto Thee in every condition, then give them to drink, with the hand of Thy bounty, from the Kawthar of certitude and assurance. O our Lord, the All-Merciful! Thou art He Who hath ever been mighty to do as He pleaseth and will ever continue to be as Thou hast been from time immemorial. All created things have testified to Thy oneness and singleness, and all contingent beings to Thy greatness and power. I beseech Thee not to make Thy chosen ones be of those who hesitated after having hastened, and who were forbidden after having been commanded. Verily Thou art the Almighty, before Whose manifestation the Pharaohs of the earth and their hosts, and the tyrants of the lands and their ranks were powerless.

<p>To Ahmad the Master Builder in Kermanshah, in the name of the One Incomparable Knower:</p>
<p>O Ahmad! When Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - appeared, they reviled Him and issued a decree for His death. Before Him came the Spirit (Christ), whom they crucified, and likewise they denied Moses, and cast the Friend of the All-Merciful (Abraham) into the fire. What was the cause and reason for these matchless and unprecedented injustices? It was the divines of the age - by their decree the rulers acted, doing that which caused all things to lament and the Tablet and Pen to weep. They martyred the Herald (the Bab) - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - and now each day they scheme against this Wronged One. They hamstrung His she-camel, they tore apart His sheep, they sank His ship. The Wolf and his son committed that which no oppressor had ever done. Yet whatsoever hath befallen hath caused the exaltation of God’s Word and the advancement of His Cause. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all things! I testify that Thou doest whatsoever Thou willest through Thy power which encompasseth all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Ordain for me from the wonders of Thy grace such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of Thy acceptance and the sweet-scented breeze of Thy good-pleasure. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by Thy pre-existent mercy and Thy all-encompassing favor and Thy generosity which hath encompassed the heavens and earth, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones.

The Kawthar of utterance flows from His Pen, and the Salsabil of knowledge is manifest and visible through His Name. One drop thereof would resurrect the inhabitants of the graves and bestow upon them eternal life. By graves is meant heedlessness of the self and passion, and the death of those in such graves is more severe and greater than physical death.

<p>O Muhammad! Days have passed and We have not heard from the bird of thy heart the melodies of love, nor have We found from thee the sweet savors of longing and affection. It is as though thou hast forgotten Us and forgotten the stations of reunion while the breezes of grace wafted upon thee. And if thou forgettest Us, verily We do not forget thee, and if thou art heedless of Our remembrance, verily We are not heedless of thee. Return, then, to what thou wert before, for the world and its ornaments and its embellishments will profit thee not. What will profit thee is detachment from all save Him and thy turning unto God. Hearken, then, unto Me, and deprive not thy soul of divine meanings, nor thine ear from hearing the melodies of oneness, nor thine eyes from beholding the beauty of the Divine Identity, nor thy feet from standing firm in the Cause of God that hath been sent down, nor thy hands from being raised to the heaven of bounty. Ponder, then, upon thy affair, and choose for thyself what thou desirest. But if thou wouldst hearken unto Me, choose that which will draw thee nigh unto the meeting with thy Beloved and will unite thee with thy Lord and thy Goal. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance.</p>

Open then thy lips in My name, the Opener. Move then thy tongue in My name, the Mover. Intone then My melodies and proclaim: O denizens of earth and heaven! By the one true God, verily, He Who is the Lord of Eternity hath appeared and shone forth above the horizon of creation through the power of His most lofty, His most exalted sovereignty.</p>

<p>O Baqir! We have heard the tumult of your heart and the cry of your inmost being, the trembling of your inner self and the agitation of your body, and We have answered you at this time with these words, that they may be a light unto you and a mercy unto all the worlds. Grieve not over anything, but place your trust in God and be not of them that despair. Verily, the mercy of your Lord has encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. He will take you unto Himself by His command. He is, in truth, your Guardian, and He knows the unseen in the heavens and earth, and knows what is in your heart. He will ordain for you what has been decreed for you. Be patient and grieve not, for He will surely reward the patient. Bear witness now that you have believed in God and His signs, and have followed His loved ones, and have loved those who have believed in Him, and thus have you been numbered among them that are assured. God will exalt the stations of those who have feared Him and been patient for His sake, and will remember them even as We have remembered you at this time with most excellent and beauteous remembrance. Fear no one and [grieve not over anything]. Turn wholly unto God and place your complete trust in Him, and be not of them that fear. Convey from Us the Word of Victory and give him glad tidings of a mercy from God and a great reward. There shall descend upon him that which will gladden his heart, that he may be of the God-fearing. Glorify him and remember him with the love that proceeds from God, the Mighty, the Luminous.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! This is he who has detached himself from his home, journeyed from his native land, and emigrated in Thy path, and has striven in Thy love until he reached the seat of Thy Self and the repository of Thy Beauty and the treasury of Thy Glory, and heard Thy melodies and beheld Thy lights, and visited the sanctuary of Thy presence and the Kaaba of Thy reunion, and thereby entered into the fortress of Thy care and the garden of Thy bounty. Shelter him, O my God, beneath the shade of Thy loving-kindness and in the city of Thy favor, and provide him with the fruits of the tree of Thy divinity, then cause him to return unto Thee, for Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>Praise and thanksgiving that hath proceeded from the tongue of grandeur hath ever been and still is reserved unto His hallowed Being. Had it not been for the letter Shin of the complaints of the heedless ones becoming manifest, verily would the decree of the Tree of Paradise have been realized and made manifest in this earthly realm, and the world would have been freed and delivered from the blow of want. Exalted be His station of thanksgiving, and exalted be that which proceedeth from Him by the leave of His Creator and His Lord. O My Name Ali-Qabl-Akbar, upon thee be the Glory of God, and O Mahdi, upon thee be My everlasting Glory. The letter which thou didst send through him who was named Siyyid-Qabl-Hasan hath come before the Wronged One. We testify that he hath attained unto the presence and hearing. Blessed is he, inasmuch as We have found from his letter the fragrance of My wondrous and glorious love. We beseech God to adorn him with the light of turning unto Him, that he may hold fast unto it, severed from all else save Him. This is God’s decree, both in the past and in the future, but most men know it not. O Hasan, render thanks unto God, thy Lord, for He hath made mention of thee and hath sent down for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure throughout the duration of His glorious and mighty Kingdom. The bounty and the bestowal belong unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: O Hasan, We shall soon send that which thou didst desire through the grace of thy Lord. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The Glory from Us be upon thee, O My Name, and upon My martyrs in the Land of Ya, and upon all who are steadfast and upright.</p>

<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! The letter of his honor Yusuf-’Ali which thou didst send hath attained unto the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, and at this moment one of My Branches who is named Badi’u’llah is present and is, according to His command, engaged in writing this reply before the face of the Lord of all beings. Glory be to God! Every day new events appear. I know, and thou knowest, and God knoweth, and the Branch knoweth and testifieth that the Wronged One hath desired for the people of God naught save that which will exalt them and draw them nigh unto Him. In most of the Tablets We have commanded all to manifest love, fellowship, affection and unity, and We beseech God not to deprive His people of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. O My Name! The divine counsels of the All-Merciful and the heavenly exhortations of the Lord are recorded and inscribed in every leaf, and the primary purpose hath been and is to extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity, and likewise to elevate and exalt their stations. Ask of God, and We beseech Him, to purify the hearts of His loved ones with the water of detachment and to illumine them with the light of trust and resignation. Verily He is the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. The fame of the loved ones in ’Ishqabad hath spread abroad and every discerning soul hath perceived therefrom the fragrance of the spirit and of divine favors. And should anyone spread reports contrary to what hath been spread abroad, this would surely cause abasement and humiliation. It is incumbent upon all to be united in the Cause of God and to drink the water of unity from the hands of divine bounty of the Lord of creation, and to concentrate their efforts on the exaltation of the Word of God. The world and its conditions are not worthy of mention. By the life of God! Whosoever holdeth fast unto that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen shall attain unto the most exalted station and the most sublime rank. The call “Depart! Depart!” hath ever been raised. We hope that through this counsel all in the world may be freed from the bondage of self and passion. O Yusuf-’Ali, upon thee be My Baha! God willing, mayest thou be assisted in that which [is befitting for] these days, and do thou strive thy utmost to unite hearts. [He will assist those who arise to serve Him and unite the hearts of His servants. The splendor…] O My people in ’Ishq[abad] and upon those who have today cast aside what is with the people, holding fast to the mighty and impregnable cord of God.</p>

<p>O My Name Mahdi! Upon thee be the peace of God and His glory! The letter from Ghulam-’Ali which thou didst send to the Most Holy Court hath arrived. In truth, the previously mentioned word which states “tribulation is for those who are near” hath proven true in relation to his condition. Although the True One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath testified to the truth of these words, in these days their manifestation and appearance is witnessed more than before. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His loved ones to exercise beautiful patience and noble steadfastness. Aqa Ghulam hath endured much hardship, but this hardship is followed by mercy. Whatever occurs in the path of the Peerless Friend is beloved to the soul and the heart’s desire. Mention of him hath repeatedly flowed and been revealed from the Pen of loving-kindness: “O thou who circlest round My Cause! Give him glad tidings from Me - the Sun of Permission hath dawned for him from the horizon of the heaven of God’s will, the Lord of all worlds.” They have moved with permission and proceeded with special intention. In the trials that have befallen them, they are rewarded, not questioned. Say: “My God, my God! Draw Thy loved ones nigh unto that station from which the fragrance of Thy meeting is wafted. O my Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation. They desire naught except to attain presence before the throne of Thy grandeur and to arrive at that place wherein Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen are raised. O my Lord! Draw them nigh through Thy will, then cause them to enter through that gate which Thou hast opened unto the world through Thy Most Great Name. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>

Mention hath been made of thee and of that which thy tongue hath uttered in praise of God. All this is from God’s bounty unto thee. We beseech the True One to aid thee, that thou mayest, through His Name, conquer the world of hearts and be free in the path of His love from the world and all who dwell therein. The love of the world hath prevented and deprived the peoples from turning to the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory. We beseech Him to bestow upon thee a strength which no weakness can affect, that perchance the light of certitude may triumph over the darkness of vain imaginings. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land and remind them that the loved ones arrived and were blessed to circumambulate the point round which circle the Concourse on High. His honor ’Ali-Akbar was blessed to circumambulate during the Feast of Sacrifice and the pilgrimage of God. We beseech God to ordain for His loved ones what He hath ordained for thee and him. Verily, He is powerful over all things.

<p>O Mahdi! Upon thee be God’s everlasting peace and His eternal splendor! This Wronged One beholds Himself immersed in an ocean of sorrow. The deeds and actions of some are like arrows and spears directed and descending from every direction. At this moment the Mother Book lamenteth, inasmuch as We have spread forth a carpet of trustworthiness and religiosity for the deceased. We beseech God to bestow justice. Thou thyself art witness that in most Tablets We have summoned all to chastity, trustworthiness and religiosity. Today the eyes of the Tablets weep, for the actions of some have become the cause of the derision of others and the turning away of the servants. Whosoever heareth the details of that land will surely engage in mockery, ridicule and calumnies that cause distress and sorrow to the people of the cities of justice. The letter that was sent hath come to Our notice, and this Wronged One hath felt and continues to feel the utmost grief at what hath occurred. What benefit have the treacherous derived from their treachery? For the sake of enjoying two days they have chosen and continue to choose eternal torment. In any case, the Pen is powerless and unable to make mention of what hath transpired. We beseech God to grant ease after hardship, joy after sorrow, and facility after difficulty. O my God, my God! Thou knowest and seest what hath befallen the Wronged One in His days. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Prophets, Thy chosen ones and Thy trusted ones, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty a blessing upon Thy loved ones and a mercy upon them through Thy grace, Thy generosity and Thy bounty. O my Lord! Change poverty into wealth, hardship into ease, and darkness into light. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O loved ones, come, let us heave a sigh from the heart and set aflame a fire in our souls. Let us ask the hoopoe of the spirit the way to His street, that we may reach the sacred precincts of His sanctuary. Let us learn the ways of passion and celestial melody from the nightingales of His holy rose garden, and accept the manner of burning and consuming from the candle of His chamber. Like the tulips of the sacred garden, let us brand our souls with the mark of union with Him, pluck the flower of desire from the paradise of His companionship, drink of the wine of His presence, and strive in the ocean of effacement. Let us become intoxicated and set fire to existence itself, scatter our souls at His feet and drag our hearts to His street. O ye who are still dizzy from sleep, the holy musicians have begun their Christ-like melodies, and the servants of the intimate gathering have harmonized with spiritual ecstasies, and the divine cup-bearers have opened the doors of the eternal wine-cellar and with one glance have captured the hearts of the heavenly maidens, holding flame-colored cups in their hands and standing rank upon rank with mystic signs. The breeze of faithfulness blows from the realm of eternity and the fragrance of God wafts from the city of Baha. O ye wounded hearts, the divine Physician has come - a thousand remedies flow from His ruby lips. That Dawn of the unseen Glory, that Countenance beyond doubt has come. The breathings of Sinai reach us from the Throne of meeting. Spiritual melodies from the divine throat and holy effulgences arrive with might and glory. Glad tidings for the poor, a sign for the lowly - verses of wealth arrive from the hidden treasure. Remove the veils from heart and soul, for from that door the lights of radiance arrive to the world. O nightingales filled with yearning and passion, it is the time of the rose, and O fallen ones still dizzy from wine, this is the surging of the wine, and O Jacobs in the wilderness of separation, the fragrance of Joseph of Iraq and the spiritual breaths of the covenant are being bestowed upon creation and the breath of the horizons, and the merciful breathings blow from the holy divine hiding place, and the morning breezes of inner meanings arrive from the unseen garden of Sinai.</p>

<p>O annihilated Shaykh! May you be, God willing, forever and always annihilated from self and abiding in the remembrance of Truth, in such wise that from your tongue may be heard at all times the mention of God, and from your heart may be inhaled the love of the Beloved, and from your face may be witnessed the radiance of the All-Merciful. Your letter was presented before the Throne, and in response thereto a Tablet was sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will. Subdue hearts through mention of the Beloved and move all creation by the cord of the love of thy Lord, the Sovereign of all worlds. This is what We have ordained in the Tablets. Let not sorrows overtake thee. Be thou joyful in the days of thy Lord, then remind souls of that which hath been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Specifically for Nabil-i-Baqir, wondrous words have shone forth from the Dayspring of the divine Finger and been dispatched. God willing, may they attain thereunto. Convey My glorification unto him and unto those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Praise be to the Best-Beloved of the worlds that thy mention hath been and continues to be remembered before the Throne. If thou asketh God thy Lord, He would send down clear verses for every soul. Verily thy Lord loveth him who hath loved Him and desireth him who hath desired Him. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Remind on My behalf Siyyid-i-Kazim. Say: Blessed is he who hath turned to God in this Day wherein the Herald hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to the Dayspring of the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. Say: Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that vain imaginings shall not withhold thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, nor shall the veils of the heedless conceal thee. Adorn thy head with the crown of the mention of the Glory between earth and heaven, and thy tongue with this Name whereby the liver of polytheism was cleft asunder and the countenance of unity shone forth from the horizon of the command of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Be as thy Lord was. The calamities never prevented Him from the mention of the Lord of all creation. He summoneth the people at all times unto God, the Mighty, the Peerless. That which thou seest today shall perish, and that which shall endure is His mention of His loved ones and what He hath ordained for them in the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thus have We commanded thee that thou mayest rejoice in the remembrance of thy Lord and be of them that have attained. Say: All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O handmaiden of God! Hearing is a divine trust. Purify and sanctify it from the words and allusions of them that are on earth, that thou mayest hear the Word of God which hath dawned from the Dayspring of the mouth of the Divine Unity, and attain unto the purpose of the worlds. Today all, whether men or women, wander bewildered in the wilderness of their desires, save those souls who, through the power of the Most Great Name, have clung to the hem of the Lord of the Ancient Days. These are the gems of creation in the sight of God, and all others are as naught and non-existent.</p>
<p>Strive thou to reach the abode of immortality, which is the station of recognition of the Abha Beauty, and become illumined with the lights of His Cause. Render thanks unto God that thou hast been honored with this supreme distinction and hast directed thyself from thy homeland toward the dwelling-place of thy Beloved. Ere long the mention of this turning shall be spread among the favored servants. Detach thyself from the worlds and attach thyself to the All-Merciful. Be not grieved by outward affairs and the conditions of this base world, for all shall be seized by extinction while permanence belongeth and shall belong to God alone. Soon all shall return to dust, and sovereignty and power and grandeur and dominion shall remain with the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst distinguish between Thy servants, and from which most of the people of Thy realm took flight, to make me turn toward the sanctuary of Thy good-pleasure and direct myself to the sanctuary of Thy recognition. O Lord! I am one of Thy handmaidens who hath turned to Thee, held fast to the cord of Thy bounty, and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy and favors. O Lord! I am athirst; send down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy the rain of Thy grace. O Lord! I am poor; send down upon me from the heaven of Thy riches that which will make me independent of all except Thee. Then assist, O my God, my kindred to arise to aid Thy Cause and turn toward the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and Thy glory, and enable them, O my God, to remember Thee and praise Thee amidst Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>O Muhammad, who has been honored with the name of the All-Knowing One! O Muhammad! Praise be to God that thou hast turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon, hast drunk from the Kawthar of reunion, and hast attained unto the lights of the Presence which is the greatest and most glorious of all deeds, and hast heard, time and again with thine own ears, the call of the Wronged One. We beseech God - exalted and glorified be He - not to withhold, through His boundless grace, the droppings of the Most Great Ocean from thee and from the other friends. Say: Occupy not yourselves with the mirage, and deprive not yourselves of the waves of the ocean of meanings. The pleasures of the world have been and shall ever be transient. Say: Be not beguiled by its honey for it is pure venom. Strive ye that all may be adorned with the ornament of knowledge. Convey to all those souls who are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon the greetings of this Wronged One, that all may be gladdened by the sweet savors of divine glorification and may act in accordance with that which is befitting. To all those souls, both men and women, who have turned toward the Prison and have attained unto the lights of the Throne, convey greetings from God. God willing, they must attain unto and act according to that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. O friends! Fix your gaze in all conditions upon steadfastness and trustworthiness. These two qualities are as two great luminaries shining forth and manifest from the heaven of the divine Tablet. Blessed is the state of the one who is illumined by the light of these two luminaries. By the Most Great Name! Such a one is recorded and inscribed in the Book among the Concourse on High. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, in that thou hast attained unto the lights of the Kingdom and hast believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily, she who hath ascended is among those who have attained in a preserved Tablet. Be thou assured through the grace of thy Lord, then act according to that which thou hast been commanded by the One Who is the All-Knowing Revealer. O people of Q! We have heard your call and have answered you through Our grace, for We are the Answerer. Unite ye first, then make mention of your Lord, the Stranger. The glory rest upon you and upon thee, O Muhammad, and upon thy mother who hath recognized and attained and heard that which the Tongue of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath uttered, and upon thy family and upon those women who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>How many trees are adorned with wondrous divine fruits while we remain imprisoned beneath the earth, and how many flourishing gardens appear on earth while these existing eyes are forbidden from beholding them! How many birds sing upon the branches of trees while these ears are deprived of hearing them! Therefore, one must count these numbered days as precious and not remain heedless of the remembrance and praise of God. In all conditions, take refuge in God and be vigilant lest through satanic whisperings you remain deprived of the divine breezes. Strive to manifest yourself among people with goodly character and praiseworthy deeds, that perhaps the breaths of holiness and detachment may waft from you, that perchance the hearts of the dead may attain eternal life through association and fellowship with you and become sustained by the Kawthar of submission and contentment. Although the counsel of the wise benefits not the ignorant - as We have counseled in all Tablets that no one should oppose another - from the time of Our sojourn in Iraq until now We have forbidden people from carnal desires and from contention and warfare with others. Nevertheless, they committed that which was forbidden in all pages and Tablets, and the harm of the deeds of the ignorant has rebounded upon this imprisoned servant. And souls who have committed all manner of unseemly acts now display themselves in the garment of asceticism and attribute to this servant all that they have done. This is what was revealed in previous Books, that wolves would appear in sheep’s clothing and busy themselves with deceiving people. In any case, in all conditions fix your gaze upon the Truth and be detached from all else. Count His remembrance as precious and betray not the trust of His love to the treacherous and the thief, but preserve it with the utmost care. Give thanks at all times that separation has been changed to union, remoteness to nearness, and that you have attained the recognition of God in days when most are veiled. And the Spirit be upon you.</p>

<p>TRANSLATION:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the World! Say: How sweet is the Kawthar of steadfastness if you drink it from the hand of the Friend, and how excellent is its fragrance if you attain unto it! Say: O friends! The Lord of all possibility proclaims: The crown of all deeds is steadfastness - hold fast unto it! It is the most exalted of all stations - fix your gaze upon it! It is the most great gift that preserves its possessor from the allusions of the ungodly, the whisperings of Satan, and the cawing of the ravens. It is an armor woven by the hands of the True Creator - whosoever adorns himself therewith shall be protected from the darts of Satan. God willing, may the people of truth drink from this cup through the outpourings of the All-Bountiful and attain this most great bounty. Strange it is that souls witness the dawning of the lights of the Sun of grandeur and power at its zenith, yet still veil themselves through the imaginings of their own illusory selves. Convey this spiritual remembrance - which is in truth the everlasting Kawthar flowing from the Dawning-Place of divine favors - to the friends of Truth, that all may discover its fragrance and become detached and free from all else. The gaze of His loving-kindness has ever been directed towards His friends, and He has desired for all whatsoever leads to the praiseworthy station. Blessed is he who hearkens unto that which the Desired One hath uttered in this perspicuous Tablet. Hearken to the call of the Wronged One, raised from the direction of the Most Great Prison, and arise to serve the Cause with such arising that no sitting down shall seize it, and with such ardor that no cooling shall ever quench its flame. God willing, mayest thou soar on the wings of remembrance and utterance in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful, and through wondrous and sublime remembrances which have shone forth from the horizon of the Mouth of the Will of the All-Merciful, guide all to the straight path. We beseech God to assist thee in His service, His remembrance and His praise, to draw thee nigh unto the Sea whereof whosoever drinketh shall become detached from all else save Him, and to ordain for thee good in the hereafter and in this world. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>

<p>This is mentioned in the Persian tongue so that the souls in that land may hear and discover: The True One, exalted be His glory, promised and gave glad tidings to all the peoples of the earth through the tongue of the Prophets and Messengers concerning this most holy, most mighty and most luminous Day, that all might prepare themselves for the divine presence and not let slip the time. Yet when the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of Will, all turned away and rose up in opposition. Would that they had been content with such actions! Rather, they arose to spread calumnies and issued verdicts for the shedding of pure blood. There remained no land wherein their blood was not shed, and no air unto which their sighs did not ascend. Verily thy Lord is the All-Numbering, the All-Knowing. These abominable deeds have been and will be the cause of tribulation and hardship for all on earth. For many years afflictions have not ceased from the earth but rather pour forth like torrential rain. If they subside in one direction, they flame forth from another. Holy, assured, content and well-pleased souls - whatever befalls them has been and will be in the path of God. If they are martyred, their spirits ascend to the Most Glorious Companion and find their dwelling in the highest Paradise. By the life of God, theirs is the best end and most excellent return! But oppressive souls shall be afflicted with the flames of divine wrath a second time, and after their spirits depart they shall be tormented with a punishment a hundred thousand times more severe than earthly torment. Thus doth inform thee He with Whom is the knowledge of the Book. Afflictions will not cease until they repent and return unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Face when every ignorant doubter turned away.</p>
<p>Convey this Tablet to the loved ones in that land that they may attain supreme joy and become aware of their station and rank, and preserve their stations through the Name of God. The glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of the Kind, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>O S! Upon thee be My glory! Know thou with clear certitude that the glance of God’s loving-kindness, exalted be His glory, hath been and continues to be directed toward the land of S. Within that land are concealed and treasured the divine trusts. Say: Blessed, blessed art thou, O Land of Sad! What land can be likened unto thee? God hath made thee the repository of His names and attributes, next to the sacred and specially designated lands. It was honored by the presence of the two Husayns, whom neither the swords of hatred nor the might of the oppressors could hold back from God, the Lord of the worlds. They advanced to the field of martyrdom, yearning for reunion with the Creator of heaven, and sacrificed their souls in the manifest and straight Path. They cast behind them the world, its riches, glory, bounties and pleasures - to this every fair-minded and discerning one bears witness. And before them, al-Kazim and those with him performed such deeds in the path of God as bewildered the hearts of those near unto Him. And after them came al-Ashraf, through whose blood God adorned the cities of justice and equity and the countenances of the lovers throughout all regions. We testify that he attained the presence and meeting with God and heard His mighty and wondrous call. The eyes of the companions of the Covenant in the City of the Lovers wept for them. Thus hath spoken the Luminary of the horizons from His mighty prison. It behooveth the people of God to remember them with goodly remembrance and according to what the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Wise, hath recorded. The Pen of Command in the Most Great Scene, from the presence of the Lord of Destiny, now giveth thee glad tidings that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. Thou hast attained the service of My Cause, and whoso attaineth unto it is, in the Mother Book, among the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark which the Lord of creation sent down in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’, a command from My presence - and I am the Ancient Commander. Thou art, in the sight of God, the Lord of creation, among the people of the Ark. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve this most exalted station and this supreme and abiding glory. Verily He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon thee from Us, and upon those whom neither commerce, nor trade, nor wealth, nor glory hath withheld from God, the Mighty, the Most Praised.</p>

<p>O Mulla Abu’l-Hasan! In the Name of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful! These are the verses of God, the King, the Truth, the Manifest Justice, unto him who was guided by the guidance of the Spirit and turned toward the holy precincts until he entered the spot of Paradise after the Sun of Grandeur and Glory had set therefrom, and he lamented with the lamentation of those who have lost. O servant! Know thou that thy yearning in separation from the Luminary of the horizons when He departed from the precincts of Iraq was greater in the sight of God than the worship of most of the servants. Thus have We distinguished thee with the truth, and verily We have power over all things. We were with thee and heard thy cry and thy yearning, and We have ordained for thee in the Tablets a reward that was truly great. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and grieve not for anything, but place thy trust in God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Generous. God hath written down for thee the reward of one who attained the presence of the Countenance and won the meeting with his Lord. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good. Arise in the Cause of God, then strive within thyself that there may be manifested from thee that which will raise up the Cause of thy Lord amongst His heedless servants. For God hath prescribed for every soul the teaching of His Cause, and He loveth that there should appear from the Lote-Trees of existence the fruits of wisdom and utterance. Thus hath He willed by His command - there is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Purposing. Arise to serve God and say: “O people of the Bayan! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath come with manifest sovereignty. Fear ye God and deny not Him for Whose path the blood of those near unto God was shed.” Say: “Verily, He Who came unto you by the name of ’Ali was the Herald of this Most Great, Most Glorious Manifestation, and His Most Exalted Pen moved only in My remembrance and praise, and there flowed from His ink naught but this wise Remembrance, until He sacrificed His soul in My love that ye might not commit in the time of the Manifestation what the people of the Furqan, and before them the people of the Torah and the Gospel, committed.” Thus doth the Pen of Command instruct thee. Act thou according to what thou hast been commanded and be not of the heedless ones. And the mercy which hath descended from the heaven of grandeur upon thee and upon the detached servants of God.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>These are the verses of the Tablet, sent down in truth for a people who understand. Therein is healing for the breasts of those who have believed in God and who place their trust in their Lord. It is verily a remembrance from Us, and a guidance and reminder for a people who fear God. O Letter of Love! Bear thou witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He hath created all things for the knowledge of His Self and the Manifestations of His Cause, and this hath been ordained in truth for what was and what will be. In every age He hath sent forth a Messenger through His grace to remind men of the days of God and guide them to the path of glory and love. Then hath He sent down tribulations, trials and afflictions, both hidden and manifest, that He might thereby separate between light and darkness. This is among the ways that have proceeded from God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. By God! Were He not looking to this station, He would subdue all who are in the heavens and earth through a single word from His presence, and this is a known truth. Thus understand thou the Cause, then be thou at peace within thyself and be of those who show patience in times of hardship. Know thou that thou hast been mentioned in the Book by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beloved. Soon will thy name be raised up in truth among the Concourse on High, and the dove of longing in thy breast will be stilled, for He is God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Praised. It behooveth thee to thank God, thy Lord, in thy heart and remember Him in thy soul and spirit, and to be among those who rejoice in God’s gladness. When thou hearest the Bird of Eternity hath flown to the Kingdom of the divine cloud, grieve not within thyself but place thy trust in God, for in Him do the detached ones place their trust. In this there is wisdom none knoweth save God, and ye shall come to know it when the mysteries are unveiled and the Cock of the Throne crieth out. This is what hath been inscribed by the Pen of Creation on a preserved holy tablet. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth and revealed unto thee this Tablet at whose comprehension the learned are bewildered. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who soar in the heaven of love.</p>

<p>Listen to the call of thy Lord from the Pole of Eternity and be not occupied with aught else save His remembrance, the Exalted, the Most Great. He calleth thee at all times with the verses of His love, if thou be of them that hear. Detach thyself from the kingdom, then arise by thyself to promote the Cause of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. By God, the True One! That which thou beholdest on earth shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Single, the One, the Peerless, the All-Wise. Then remind the people of that which God hath cast into thy heart, and tarry not in thy soul less than a moment. And if thou findest one who is receptive, cast upon him the melodies of the Spirit, and if thou findest one who turneth away, turn away from him and turn unto God, and verily He shall suffice thee against all things and against His polytheist servants. We have indeed sent down unto thee aforetime verses of wondrous glory and dispatched them by trusted messengers from among Our servants. We beseech God that they may reach thee, that thereby thine eyes may be gladdened and the eyes of the monotheists. We commanded thee therein to enjoin upon the people in these days what God hath ordained for them and to give them the glad tidings of the paradise of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Know thou that there hath befallen Us that which cannot be mentioned in words. By God! Then would all who are in the heavens and earth weep - for they who were created by My Word have desired to kill Me and shed My blood. When God frustrated what they intended, they then raised an outcry within themselves, perchance thereby to cast rancor into the hearts of the sanctified ones. Then they fabricated against Me all that befitteth their own selves and that their hands have earned, and thereby the word of chastisement became due them from the presence of One mighty and powerful. They seek to slay the Self of God with the swords of association and hatred, then recite His verses, the Wondrous, the Revealed. Were We to recount unto thee what hath befallen Us, thou wouldst grieve in thy soul and the hearts of them that are certain would grieve with thee. We have therefore concealed it from thee to preserve thy soul, lest thy heart be saddened thereby and thou become of the sorrowful. And the Glory be upon thee and upon them who hearken unto thy word concerning God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>

O Lord! I beseech Thee by him, and by his limbs and members, his heart and tongue and eyes, to ordain for me and for the people of Baha the good of this world and the world to come.

<p>O Haydar-’Ali! There can be no doubt that thy grief hath been for the sake of God and that thou hast expressed sorrow in view of the sorrows of the Wronged One. In this station, blessed art thou!

However, We have, as a token of Our grace - and verily, I am the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous - concealed its mysteries and future manifestations from the eyes of Our loved ones.</p>
<p>Outwardly, no cause for imprisonment is evident, for the power of God, exalted be His glory, hath transformed it into the Most Exalted Paradise, despite the nose of the mighty one. In every corner He hath spread a carpet and raised a call. At first, the governor’s palace was consumed by fire; the decree which that heedless ruler had sent concerning these wronged ones to this place perished along with the palace. The subsequent rulers, being unaware of the circumstances, knew not how to proceed, for neither the decree nor the previous ruler remained. The Cause of God, day by day, grew in elevation, and its power became manifest from every direction. In none of the prisons was such ascendancy witnessed, for this manifest injustice was visited upon those who circle round the Throne without any cause. Were the doubters to reflect on what hath come to pass, all would cling to the hem of the robe of certitude and turn unto the Supreme Horizon. Verily, the Cause is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And He is the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

Then establish for me a seat of truth with Thee, and make me one of Thy servants who have detached themselves from all who are in the heavens and the earth and have turned unto Thee with an illumined and pure heart.

O youth! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the direction of the Throne, and forget not the days wherein the Sun of the beauty of thy Lord dawned upon thee from this horizon which hath been mentioned in the Tablets by the Pen of God as the Youth. Remember the times when thou wert seated in My presence and didst hear with thine own ears the melodies of God, and in those days We concealed Our face from all who are in the heavens and on earth, according to a wisdom that was hidden in God’s mystery. When the appointed time was fulfilled and the Command came forth, We drew aside the veils in Our chosen name and manifested Our Self to all created things with a sovereignty that was witnessed by all worlds. And by this means, he whom We created by Our command and preserved beneath the wings of grace turned against Us, as all beings and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur in a holy and praiseworthy station do testify. All that thou hast heard regarding his affair was from Me, and We have written concerning him that which none can reckon save God thy Lord, according to a wisdom that was treasured in the vaults of knowledge. We stood firm against the enemies in days wherein the feet of every mighty soul did slip, and We disputed with the peoples with wisdom and counsel until We made manifest the Cause through My being alone, and God is witness to what I say. And verily when My brother felt secure in himself he contended against My Self and disputed My verses, until he arose to slay Me. Thus did Satan whisper in his breast and made him to be deprived of the holy shore. Thus have We informed thee that thou mayest become aware of some of what hath befallen this Youth and mayest be clear-sighted regarding the Cause.

Say: Nothing shall profit you this Day, nor shall all that hath been created in the worlds avail you before the Sovereign of the Throne. Thus hath the All-Merciful spoken in this Tablet which hath been illumined by the lights of His countenance.</p>
<p>Say: From each letter We create beings whose number none knoweth save God, and He hath knowledge of all things. Say: Have ye occupied yourselves with the world and turned away from the Lord of Names? How long will ye slumber and not arise? Lift up your heads! By God, the Sun of Grace hath dawned from the horizon of justice with a light that encompasseth all worlds.</p>
<p>As for those who have cast the Command of God behind their backs, We have forbidden them the Living Waters. Soon shall they find themselves in the abyss of wrath and shall find no helper.</p>
<p>Rejoice thou in the Tablet of God. He remembereth thee in the prison while encompassed by the hosts of polytheism. His grace toward thee hath been great. Be not saddened by their acts. Take comfort in His remembrance, then detach thyself from all else. He verily sufficeth thee in truth. He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Grieve not over anything. All that thou beholdest shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Truth, while loss shall be for those who have not taken a path unto Him. Convey the greetings of thy Lord to those with thee who have believed, and give them the glad-tidings of what hath been ordained for them in a Tablet that lieth concealed behind the veil of glory.</p>

<p>The Sacred Being [Nabil-i-Akbar] is the Most Wondrous, the Most Impregnable, the Most Glorious. This is a remembrance from God, from the Tree of Light in the form of fire, which was witnessed from the direction of the Throne. Verily He hath unveiled Beauty, whereat all those of lofty station were thunderstruck. Through Him God tested His servants who claimed faith within themselves, and through Him truth was distinguished from falsehood from that time until the Day when the Beauty of Baha will come upon the crimson Buraq and the matter will be decided by One mighty and powerful. Those who believed in God in those days - these will God raise up on that Day with faces from which all created things will be illumined. And those who disbelieved and joined partners with God - the angels of chastisement will drive them away with whips of wrath, and they shall find no way unto God. Thus do We set forth the verses and explain the two paths that whosoever willeth may choose for himself what he desireth. Verily my Lord is independent of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Leaf of the Ridvan! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, from the direction of the Throne, that it may draw thee to a station holy and luminous. Purify thyself from the hints of earth and whatsoever is thereon, that thou mayest be detached from the world and its ornaments, remembering thy Lord with a pure and wondrous heart. Remember thy Lord in the darkness of night and at the break of dawn, that God may make thee one of the leaves that were witnessed upon the Branch of the Cause. Hold fast to the cord of God and His grace, then place thy trust in Him in all matters. Verily He watcheth over all things. Give thanks to thy Lord that We have sent down the verses in this Tablet and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of holiness from this Youth Who was imprisoned under oppression. O handmaid of God! Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord and be not of those women who take for themselves in every age a god to worship. Turn thy face toward God and sanctify thyself from the defilement of sovereignty, that God may cause thee to dwell in the shadow of His protection in a station that was exalted in truth. And glory be upon thee and upon those women who have turned their faces to the countenance that shone from the horizon of holiness with radiant light.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted, the Most High! The remembrance of God from the Tree of the Command has now been raised in the most wondrous melodies. Verily He is the Most Great Mystery between the heavens and the earth, and the Mighty News in this Mystery which has been witnessed from the holy horizon. Everything speaks forth: “Verily I am God, there is no God but Him,” and verily He encompasses all things. O servant of God! Hear the call of thy Lord from this Bird which has soared in this heaven that has been spread forth in this atmosphere which has appeared in truth as a Command from Our presence that there is no God but Him. And verily He Who speaks in truth is the Manifestation of God and His Mystery, the Concealment of God and His Command, the Proof of God and His Word unto all who are on earth. Bear thou witness to that which God hath testified in this Tablet. By God! This is better for thee than all that hath been created in the realm of origination and fashioned in the kingdom of invention, and God is witness to this. Forget not thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Verily He hath not forgotten thee, and His favor unto thee hath indeed been abundant. Blessed are ye for having taken hold of the words of God and preserved them from the touch of every rejected polytheist. Thus doth God single out whom He willeth through His grace, and He rendereth vain the deeds of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and have deprived themselves of the holy paradise. Leave the polytheists to themselves, then make mention of thy Lord throughout all days. Verily He will suffice thee in truth and will aid thee in the Cause with a manifest sovereignty. Blessed are ye, O people of the Pavilion of Glory, inasmuch as the glances of God have been directed toward you and He hath turned you from the left hand of idle fancy to the blessed right hand. He hath sent down unto you the Book and caused you to recognize the Manifestation of His Self, and made you to be of those who have found a way unto Him Who occupieth the throne. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for having aided thee in His Cause and nourished thee from the fruits which have appeared from the Tree of Eternity. Verily He is powerful over all things. And glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who stand firm in the love of thy Lord.</p>

<p>O Afnan, Haji Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be all My most glorious and most resplendent Baha! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the heaven of proof. A mention from Us to him who attained to acceptance on a day wherein the men who claimed knowledge without any proof from God, the Lord of the worlds, turned away. Through their turning away the people turned away, whereby there befell the Lord of the world that which caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy and My loving-kindness. The servant present hath presented that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of earth and heaven and Lord of the mighty throne. He read it before Our face. We found therein that which beseemeth thee in the days of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have heard and answered thee. Verily He is the Hearing, the Seeing. We bear witness that thou hast arisen to serve the Cause and hast manifested that whose fragrance shall never be cut off throughout the endurance of the names and attributes of God. Verily thy Lord is the True, the Faithful. Say: My God, my God! I desire to remember Thee in such wise that from the very stones Thy remembrance and praise might be raised up, and from the seas Thy glorification and Thy celebration of unity. O my Lord! Aid me in such remembrance whereby there might appear in all things a tongue speaking of Thy verses and testifying to what Thou hast manifested in Thy days. Thou art He to Whose power and might and grandeur and dominion all created things have testified. Write down for me then from Thy Most Exalted Pen what beseemeth Thy grace and Thy favors and Thy generosity and Thy gifts. O my Lord! How can I recount the wondrous tokens of Thy loving-kindness? By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of the world and Beloved of the nations! I see myself powerless to enumerate them, much less to render thanks for them. Through Thy grace Thou hast shown me what was withheld from Thy Moses on the Mount of Rapture and caused me to hear what Thy Beloved heard in His night ascent. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, by Thy Name through which the mysteries were revealed and rivers flowed from rocks, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the splendors of the lights of Thy countenance, to draw me nigh unto Thee in the manifest exterior even as Thou hast drawn me nigh in the interior. Then preserve me, O my God, from the evil of Thine enemies who violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, who disputed Thy verses and denied Thy proof. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling.</p>

<p>Tabas Mahdi, who hath migrated, the Most Ancient, Most Great, Most Bountiful</p>
<p>A remembrance from Us unto him who hath turned unto God after hearing His call from the luminous Lote-Tree raised up upon the crimson spot. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh unto the Desired One and for having migrated from thy homeland out of longing to attain the presence of God, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Know thou the worth of this station - naught that hath been created in the realm of existence can compare with it. O Mahdi! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One Who, from the dark pit, calleth out to them that dwell in the kingdom of creation and summoneth them unto God, the Lord of all mankind. Wert thou to become aware of the tribulations of thy Lord, thou wouldst weep as weepeth one who is bereaved. Though We have made mention of it in the Tablets, it representeth but a drop from the ocean. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Grieve not at anything. Be content with what God hath ordained for thee. He hath destined for those who desire Him that which is better for them than all else created in the contingent world. Didst thou but know what hath been inscribed for thee by the Most Exalted Pen, thou wouldst soar with rapture. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then stand firm in the love of thy Lord, for this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed - none comprehendeth it save those endued with understanding. We have heard thy call and have answered thee with this Tablet whereby the brocade of the Book of Creation hath been adorned. Sorrow not over anything. Place thy trust in God. He is with thee and will help thee in truth. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Compelling. Preserve the verses of thy Lord, then recite them with the melody of the heart. God willing, mayest thou ever rest beneath the shade of the favors of the eternal King and be adorned with the ornament of His bounties. Strive that perchance in these fleeting days thou mayest arise to serve the Countenance of the All-Glorious, be mentioned by His Name and be known by His love. The hardships thou hast borne in His path shall not be lost. No righteous deed appeareth from any doer except that its reward hath been recorded by the Pen of the King of Oneness. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. We beseech God to assist thee in His service, to aid thee in His remembrance, and to make thee one of those who have stood firm in His love and good-pleasure. He is, verily, the Ruler, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Compelling.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Great! A remembrance from Us to him who circumambulated the desert valley out of longing to attain the presence of God, the Lord of Names, until he arrived at the Most Great Prison - the place whose very atoms lament for what hath befallen this Wronged One, the Solitary, the Stranger. Wert thou to look with the eye of the heart, thou wouldst behold Me in the two prisons between the two factions. Yet My grace hath veiled the matter, and My mercy hath not permitted the rending of the veils. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. Soon shall they tear asunder with their own hands what We did not tear, and that which is in their breasts shall be revealed. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Hassan! Blessed art thou for having desired what the world desireth and for having turned towards the direction of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Remember when thou attainedst the presence of the Countenance, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused the fragrances of the All-Merciful to waft throughout all possibility. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Remember My loved ones on My behalf and glorify their faces from this distant place. Be thou a servant of thy Lord’s Cause. Beware lest anything prevent thee from His remembrance amongst the servants. He aids whosoever desires to aid His Cause. He is the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I am he who hath turned towards the Kaaba of Thy Cause and the Sanctuary of Thy glory, until I arrived before Thy throne and heard Thy melodies. I find myself powerless before the wonders of this grace that hath encompassed me and these gifts that have surrounded me. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, to assist me in serving Thee in such wise that neither doubts nor idle fancies shall hinder me, and to remember Thee amongst all peoples with wisdom and utterance throughout all days. Then manifest unto me that which is best for me, for I know not what profiteth me. Thou art the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Self to inscribe me among those who have turned with their entire being to Thy face, who have soared in the atmosphere of Thy love, and who have been so carried away by the sweet savors of Thy utterance that they have cast the world behind their backs, until their spirits took flight from their bodies. O Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love and Thy Cause in such wise that the winds of trials shall not move me. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Exalted, the Bestower. There is no God but Thee, the Most High, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>

<p>He is the Herald between earth and heaven</p>
<p>A mention from Us to one who turned towards Us when the divines of the earth turned away from Our Most Exalted Horizon, save whom God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willed. When the Self-Subsisting appeared and the Hour came, the clamor of the servants arose and they stood up to extinguish the light of God, the King, the Mighty, the Great. How many a mystic turned away from the Known One, how many a learned one cast the All-Knowing behind his back and waxed proud before God, the Lord of the worlds. How many who had accepted broke God’s Covenant on His Day, and how many extinguished ones were enkindled by the fire of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God’s Balance hath appeared in truth, yet the people were heedless of it. Say: Verily the Balance speaketh with truth, yet the people are in evident delusion. They hear the Call yet deny it, and they behold the signs of God yet turn away from them. How many a sign hath appeared in truth, and how many an evidence hath come forth from the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus have We illumined the heaven of utterance with the sun of thy Lord’s remembrance, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: O peoples of the earth, fear the All-Merciful and follow not your desires. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye are commanded by an Ordainer, All-Wise. He hath come from the heaven of utterance with the Kingdom of verses. Fear God and be not of the ignorant. How many a learned one cast the Book of God behind his back, and how many a mystic was seized by the winds of the world and withheld from the Most Exalted Horizon, and how many a sleeper heard the Call, arose and turned to His luminous horizon. When the breezes of revelation seize thee and the winds of thy Lord’s days attract thee, arise amidst the servants with power and say: O peoples of the earth! By God, the horizon of the Manifestation hath been illumined by the Promised One. Verily He hath come with the standards of verses and the hosts of meanings. If ye deny Him, by what proof can ye establish what ye possess? Fear God and be not of the losers. Thus have We illumined the horizon of remembrance and praise. Glory be upon thee and upon those whom the winds of the Manifestation stirred when the Speaker of Sinai proclaimed: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>From Aqa Rasul, upon him be the Glory of God. In the name of the One Friend: May you rest, God willing, at all times and under all conditions beneath the shade of the mercy of the All-Merciful, detached from the world and all who dwell therein. You have ever been and continue to be before Our gaze. Your burning in separation has been recorded and mentioned in divine Tablets and Writings. By My life! God has written down the reward of one who has attained His presence, heard His call, and circled round His Self. Seize this opportunity and be of the thankful ones. Praise the Beloved of the world that you are known among the people of Baha in the Supreme Concourse. Although this station is now hidden from sight, soon this bounty will become manifest in all the worlds. Occupy yourself with service to the Cause and with wisdom summon the people to the eternal Law. In these days the door of the House is closed - none may enter from without nor leave from within. From the beginning of creation until now, no one has endured such afflictions, nor have any of the Manifestations of Divine Unity and Daysprings of God’s Revelation been imprisoned in one place with seventy souls. These tribulations are unique to this Revelation. Consider then what has befallen and continues to befall Us in the land of Ta. Although the imprisonment of the Primal Point was brief, yet those who were with Him in prison, concerned with preserving their own lives, turned away and objected - except for one soul who, clinging to the cord of faithfulness, detached from all the worlds, drank the cup of martyrdom with the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and on earth, and attained the Supreme Companion. But be not grieved - despite all internal and external tribulations, the Cause of God is manifest with utmost glory and the light of God is radiant. Exalted be this bounty that has encompassed the horizons and this power that has encompassed the worlds. Convey greetings from the All-Merciful to all the friends and command all to steadfastness, for this station is most great. Blessed is he who has attained unto it - he is, before God, the Most High, the Most Great, of the people of Baha.</p>

<p>May my spirit be a sacrifice for you! Your most luminous and pure letter dated the 25th of Sha’ban arrived at the most auspicious time. Praise and gratitude be to God! The ear of the soul was blessed to hear the melodies, songs and warbling of the doves of praise and glorification of the peerless Beloved from the branches and twigs of the Tree of Utterance and the Lote-Tree of Exposition of your honor. Blessed be the hearers! In detail it was presented at the Most Holy Court. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>“O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! We have heard your call and read your letter and recognized what was in your heart of the love of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention of all whose names flowed from your pen - this is of My favor upon you. Be thankful and say: Praise be to Thee, O God of existence! And in all this We are watching you, and this is a favor that behooves you to thank for as long as the heavens and earth endure - nay, as long as My Most Beautiful Names endure - nay, as long as My Self, which overshadows all witnesses and witnessed things, all those who remember and are remembered, endures. Convey My greetings to My loved ones, remind them with My tongue, adorn them with the garments of My grace, and illumine them with the lights of My luminous and beloved Utterance.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about Aqa Jamal, this is what was revealed concerning him: “Verily We have remembered him in the Kingdom of My prison and have accepted what he hath wrought in the path of God. Blessed is he in that he heard God’s call and responded to it. By My life! His deed is better than the deeds of those who have turned toward the direction of the Throne without God’s leave, the Protector, the Manifest, the All-Wise. Give him these glad tidings that the fragrances of his Lord’s love, the Mighty, the Generous, may take possession of him. We make mention of him even as We have mentioned him as a favor from Us, and I am the All-Remembering, the All-Informed. Those who cast the command of God behind their backs are indeed following their own desires. The Pen of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, beareth witness to this. The Cause is in His hands. He accepteth from whomsoever He willeth what he hath wrought in His path, and ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth that which shall profit him in the worlds of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the small piece, I beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, to answer your honor’s prayer and that your honor yourself may be engaged in service at the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Haji Kazim - this land has become greatly populated and has caused rumors among the people. Thirty-five souls, in addition to those who emigrated with the Ancient Beauty, have gathered here. Consider then what has occurred and is occurring in the prison city, despite its constraints, lack of means, the discord of its people and the agitation of its inhabitants. In these days from the land of Kha, Ab, Badi’ (upon them be the Glory of God), one of their sons and another person have arrived; and Muhammad-?adiq (upon him be 966 [the Glory of God] the Most Glorious) and another person; likewise ’Ali from the people of Q and another person; and numerous souls of whom news has arrived will be coming these days; and the sister of Aqa Husayn and her son, and another sister and her husband; and likewise souls who are in the vicinity of the prison city are continuously arriving. You yourself know what people outside of this gathering have said and are saying. I beseech God to assist His loved ones to hearken unto His commandments and prohibitions.</p>
<p>In any case, mention of Haji Kazim was made at the Divine Threshold. The utmost kindness was shown regarding him: “O Kazim! Be thou happy in the love of God and be not grieved by His prohibition. God hath loved and loveth His loved ones, and He commandeth whatsoever is required by the time and is wise. Praise be to God, thou art mentioned at the Most Holy Court and art honored by His mention. Be not grieved by the lack of permission. By My life, My utterance is sweeter than all sweetness and My mention is more delicate than the breeze. Be content with that and be grateful to the Exalted Truth. He is the Bestower of the reward of attainment and the Cupbearer of the Kawthar of reunion. Grieve not. With complete joy, be occupied with His mention among the people, but with wisdom.” End quote.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the sum that you wrote one of the handmaidens had sent through Nabil - it arrived, but according to previous instructions, if any sum arrives it should remain with you and be reported to the Most Holy Court so that its decree may be revealed. The measuring tape that was sent also arrived. Likewise regarding the poem of Aqa ?adra - a portion of it was presented at a special time at the Most Holy Court. His service was accepted, but its circulation depends on all of it being presented and the Sun of permission rising. There is so much work that truly this servant and a hundred like this servant are powerless and wanting, except through the confirmations of the Beloved.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Aqa Ghulam-’Ali - that you were pleased he had not arrived without permission - it was said that complete permission is that which is obtained from the land of residence, whereas he sought permission after departing from that land and arrived in these parts. Therefore, some aspects of permission apply to him but not all. They are also concerned about his wife and child, but upon arrival he was unwell, and the climate of the prison is known - he has not yet fully recovered. God willing, they must act according to the divine ordinances revealed in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>Regarding ?abibih, Na?ir was informed to tell you whatever her purpose is.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and We make mention of thee from this mighty Prison. Say: O My loved ones! Be not grieved by that which hath befallen you in the path of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing. Consider the generations of the past and the bygone ages, and what befell therein the trusted ones of God and His chosen ones who called the people unto God, the Lord of the worlds. By My life! The people are veiled by a mighty veil and are in manifest loss. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, and they who have shown patience seeking His good-pleasure - these are they who are guided among all creation. The dwellers of Paradise and this noble scene do offer prayers for them. O My loved ones! Dispute not with anyone. Hold fast unto what is seemly in all conditions. Read ye what We have sent down aforetime from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. God shall soon exalt your names and your remembrance, despite those who have veiled themselves from this Cause whereby the horizon of utterance was illumined and the Dove of exposition did warble. The Kingdom is God’s, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! The names of those persons mentioned in thy letters have been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. This is due to the favor that hath been shown unto thee and continueth to be shown. For instance, if today the most wretched of people should cleave unto thee, he would be forgiven and mentioned in the presence of God, even though he be unaware of it. Should they deem it advisable, they may deliver the revealed response to whomsoever they wish, otherwise not - how much more for those who have turned toward God and whose mention thou hast submitted.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, his petition was submitted. Thus speaketh He, exalted be His majesty: O Sadiq! Thou hast been and art remembered, and art worthy, for thou hast attained the most great bounty and hast borne grievous trials in the path of the Beloved. We beseech God to aid thee, assist thee, and give thee to drink, at all times, from the Kawthar of His love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the petition of Muhammad-Amin Chalabi from Salahiyyih was submitted. This is what was revealed in response:</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise</p>
<p>Thy letter was present before the Wronged One, and what was mentioned therein was observed. All people are occupied with the remembrance of Truth day and night, yet they remain veiled from Truth itself. In every age and dispensation when the fragrance of the garment of the All-Merciful was diffused among the people of the world, most remained deprived of the dawning-place of divine oneness due to vain imaginings. Even as today, He Who summoneth all people to the straight path of God for His sake alone hath been imprisoned in this Most Great Prison. Yet God, exalted and glorified be He, hath made this prison a piece of paradise, and in the utmost joy and fragrance we are occupied with His remembrance, detached from all the world. We praise and thank Him for this. Verily, He is the Witness, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee and strengthen thee to be steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good. God willing, may they drink at all times from the cup of His love and be occupied with His remembrance. This is the most excellent of all deeds in the presence of the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Write this response in fine handwriting and send it.</p>
<p>Concerning the question about shaving the head, which was forbidden in the Kitab-i-Aqdas but commanded in the Surih of Pilgrimage - His exalted Word - all are today bound by the Kitab-i-Aqdas and whatever is revealed therein is the Divine decree amongst the servants, though shaving of the head hath been pardoned for those who visit the House. Today, such actions as do not cause commotion among the people should be performed by all.</p>
<p>From the land of Kha, his honor Ismu’llah-i-Javad, upon him be 9 66 [Baha], who resided in Karbila, inquired that today the non-shaving of the head causeth commotion among the people and asked about the trials of the companions and their obligations. It was decreed that the performance of certain actions is for the time of the ascendancy of the Cause, and before its ascendancy all must act with wisdom, for if any soul becometh known by this name in certain lands, the people avoid them and the teaching of the Cause is delayed.</p>
<p>Concerning the question about the Kitab-i-Iqan, known by the name of His Honor the Uncle, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, wherein fear is mentioned regarding His Holiness Moses, while in the Kitab-i-Badi’ fear is denied for the Prophets - His exalted Word: O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, that which was revealed in the Kitab-i-Iqan was mentioned regarding divine tests, in consideration of removing people’s delusions in this Dispensation. Therefore, what was revealed in the Qur’an was mentioned as the exact blessed verse without interpretation or explanation. Moreover, it is clear from the implicit meaning of the verse that what Moses, upon Him be the Glory of God, said was to silence the opponent, for they said to Him “Thou art he who committed murder and fled.” His Holiness, to confound them, mentioned the meaning of the blessed verse and confirmed: “I am indeed he, but I have been adorned with the robe of forgiveness and honored with Messengership.” The mention of fear and such matters pertains to events before His appointment, and there are various explanations regarding fear in that station which would take too long to detail. What is revealed in the Kitab-i-Badi’ is indeed the truth wherein there is no doubt. Observe His actions after His appointment - verily He was strong and trustworthy. O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, hearken unto what the Herald of Sinai speaketh in this Dispensation: “I was heedless, or I was asleep, when the breeze of the All-Merciful passed over Me and awakened Me and caused Me to cry out between earth and heaven” - even though the fragrance of the All-Merciful and the breeze of the All-Glorious emanated from Him, nay rather, He was its Creator. Reflect and be of the thankful ones. Similar utterances have been revealed in the Tablet to the Sultan and what was revealed to certain divines. This was revealed and continues to be revealed out of His grace due to the weakness of the servants. Were He to appear and speak of what He truly is, thou wouldst find the people as though dead, except for whom thy Lord willeth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mention was made of Ismu’llah-i-A?daq, upon him be God’s good-pleasure and His glory. He is remembered before the Throne, and a special prayer of visitation hath also been revealed for him from the Supreme Pen, though permission for its dispatch hath not yet been granted. God willing, whenever permitted it shall be sent and they shall attain unto it. Blessed is he for having attained and been present and heard the call of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful, and ascended unto God with joy and delight, as testified by the Pen of the All-Merciful from this luminous horizon.</p>
<p>And furthermore, the honored beloved, his eminence the Name 66 [of God] Mahdi, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, has returned some time ago and is residing in the vicinity. I conveyed your greetings to him, and he in turn sends infinite greetings. His books and tablets that were sent together with his eminence M.M., upon him be all glory, have reached him, and he mentioned what is with his eminence Ustad Ali Akbar. If given willingly, well and good, otherwise let it be. And another supplication of this evanescent servant to your eminence is that you convey expressions of sincerity and self-effacement, and most wondrous, most impregnable, most exalted, most sublime greetings on behalf of this servant to all the masters and friends of that land. Verily, the Glory be upon your eminence and upon all who attain your presence and are blessed to serve you. The Servant. 27 Dhi’l-Qa’dih 1292. The Most Great, Most Mighty Twin Branches and the Afnan of God remember your eminence with gems of remembrance and greetings.</p>

<p>May my spirit and my being be sacrificed for Thee! The blessed leaf adorned with the mention of the Beloved brought solace to this distraught heart and caused sorrows to crumble. Alexander first built from blocks of might and power an impregnable barrier so that the people of tyranny and rebellion would not transgress against the people of guidance and righteousness, and that barrier remained firm as mentioned in the Book of God. We beseech God to raise up an Alexander who will breach these barriers and fortresses and deliver the friends from imprisonment. However, they have said there are two prisons - one outward and one inward. Outward imprisonment, if without crime or transgression, is beloved; nay, that prison is the homeland of lovers and the dwelling place of those drawn nigh:</p>
<p>Wherever Thou art with me, I am content,</p>
<p>Even if my abode be in the depths of a pit.</p>
<p>Wherever our King spreads His carpet,</p>
<p>Be it a wasteland or the eye of a needle.</p>
<p>The furnace, through mention of the Friend, is a true rose garden, while the rose garden, without the Friend, is truly a furnace:</p>
<p>With Thee the furnace is a rose garden, O Life-Giver,</p>
<p>Without Thee the rose garden is a furnace, O Heart-Ravisher.</p>
<p>Every hardship in the path of the Beloved has been and will be sweet nectar. But the prison which in divine terminology truly merits this name is the prison of self and passion. We beseech God for power and strength that through His assistance we may emerge from this dark, crushing prison and enter the boundless expanse of justice and righteousness. The grief of that [physical] prison lasts but numbered days, while the afflictions of this prison are unnumbered and unlimited. We beseech God to open before your faces the gates of goodly things, for He is the Guardian of good deeds.</p>
<p>O my beloved, I have not been and am not heedless of your remembrance for a moment. All the friends, in all nights and days, are beseeching and hoping from God, glorified and exalted be He, that they may attain the presence of that soul-beloved. This is not difficult for God. The Spirit and Glory and Holiness and Splendor be upon you and your family.</p>

<p>O Ahmad Najjar, He is the Most Exalted, the Most Holy, the Most High! Glorified is He Who hath sent down the verses in truth for people who comprehend. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. All act by His bidding. O servant! Hear the call of this Youth, then help thy Lord to the extent thou art able, and be not of those who understand not. Say: He hath appeared in truth with a sovereignty before which all in the heavens and earth have bowed down, yet the people perceive not. Say: O people, fear God and wage not war against His Self, and dispute not with His Beauty, the Self-Subsisting, the Supreme. O Ahmad! Give praise to God, thy Lord, for having rent asunder the veils from thy face and made Himself known to thee in these days wherein most of the servants remain veiled from Him and have turned back on their heels. Beware lest thou forget thy Lord or take any helper other than Him. Abide beneath the shadow of thy Lord in such wise that the breath of no rejected idolater can cause thee to slip. Turn thy heart toward the direction of God, then seek His help in all matters. He will verily help thee in truth, and He doeth what He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. And if thou wishest to know what hath befallen Us after Our departure from Iraq, know that at every moment We have been afflicted by the irrevocable, firm and ordained decrees, and that the wolves of hatred have encompassed Us in this land after We created them by Our command. Thus hath it been with the Youth, if thou art of those who are informed. Let nothing cause thee grief, and if sorrows encompass thee, remember My tribulation, then My exile, then My loneliness amidst those who have denied the signs of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Beloved. And if thou wishest to depart from Iraq, depart placing thy trust in God. He will protect thee through His grace and will send down unto thee that which hath been ordained for thee in the preserved tablets of glory. Then convey Our remembrance to those servants who were with thee, and give My greetings to them. This is My command unto thee. Act according to what thou hast been commanded, and be not of those who are patient in the Cause of their Lord.</p>

<p>O Mirza Aqa! Glory be to God for this hour and time when the essence of light has donned the garment of birds that perchance it may enter the paradise of the love of the Divine Identity and alight upon the branches of the tree of faithfulness and the boughs of the Lote-Tree of eternity. And the pristine being has put on the veil of limitations that it may become a messenger from the cloud of love and find its way to the Sheba of divine love, that it may partake and receive its portion of the overwhelming ecstasy and the attractions of longing. And the holy form has accepted the mantle of the morning breeze that perchance it may enter from the chambers of the city and waft over the hair of majesty and the face of the Beloved’s beauty, that through association and communion with Him it may acquire the fragrances of the camphor of radiance and the perfume of eternity. And the divine form has become the bearer of the luminous robe of the lamp that it may be ignited and kindled in those abodes before the Beloved. And the mighty ocean has become like a river that perchance it may flow and course through that paradise. Glory be to God! What a holy gathering has been raised up and what a delightful feast has been spread! All the cherubim of the Supreme Concourse have erased and effaced from their hearts the holy stations of nearness to the most glorious horizon and the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost Boundary, and have detached and sanctified the ears of their inner consciousness from the melodies of the Dove of the Throne and the warbling of the Divine Spirit’s might, that they may enter that station and be honored and glorified by whatsoever exists in that realm. But this is a grace that appeareth from the hidden mysteries of the Cause unto whomsoever He willeth. Thus doth He give as He pleaseth and spend as He pleaseth. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and verily He is the All-Powerful, the Best-Beloved. In these days when the birds of the cloud of being have gathered and formed ranks in the heaven of manifestation, the hoopoe of attraction’s sovereignty has taken flight from the heaven of mighty glory and turned from the eternal East to the eternal West, that it may bring tidings from the city of the Divine Identity of love. Remember thou Isma’il.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I call upon Thee in this hour when sorrows have encompassed me from all sides and the arrows of hatred have been directed toward me from every quarter by those who believed not in Thee and in Thy mighty signs from time immemorial, and whose essence was created from the fire of envy and the clay of error. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for all that Thou hast caused to descend from the clouds of Thy decree and the heaven of Thy determination upon this servant who is imprisoned in this distant land. By Thy might! I complain not of whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me, nay rather I yearn for all that is associated with Thee, even though it be beyond my strength and capacity. Yet I beseech Thee, O my God, by this Name through which the heaven of names was rent asunder, to protect Thy servants from the evil of Satan and from those who have taken their idle fancies as their god. Then guard them, O my God, within the stronghold of Thy care and beneath the canopy of Thy grace and favors. Then purify, O my Beloved, their eyes that they may recognize Thee in the garment of Thy Most Glorious Name and attain unto Thy presence in the Revelation of the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted Self. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and Thou art, verily, powerful over all things. Furthermore, I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy pure Name which none among all created things hath known, and which no soul among the manifestations of Names and Attributes hath understood as it truly is, to send down upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and detach them from all else besides Thee. Then send down upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy the good of this world and the world to come, for they are poor at Thy gate and helpless before the manifestations of Thy power, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace and gazing toward the direction of Thy mercy and bounty. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O thou who art my companion! Know thou that were I to recount unto thee what hath befallen me, my weeping and the sorrow of my heart would prevent me. We have therefore concealed it and withheld the Pen from its mention. We beseech God to raise up through His sovereignty one who will make mention of my grief and tribulation.

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! My outward and inward tongue both bear witness to that which Thou didst testify for Thine own Self before the creation of the heavens and earth, that Thou art God, no God is there but Thee. Thou hast ever been mighty in Thy dominion and all-compelling, ever-subsisting and all-preserving over those in Thy earth and Thy heaven. Every possessor of a tongue hath testified to Thy oneness and every possessor of understanding to Thy singleness. Thy Word which appeared by Thy command hath encompassed all existence, both the unseen and the visible. Through it Thy power was manifested and Thy sovereignty emerged, and by it were the creatures drawn to the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and all created things to the Dawning-Place of Thy grace. Through it did the sincere ones cry out in the wilderness of separation “Where art Thou, O Beloved of those who know Thee?” and the near ones exclaimed in the desert of longing “Where art Thou, O Desire of the worlds?” Through it was Moses drawn to the Mount of Revelation when He turned toward Sinai and heard Thy sweetest call and attained the vision of Thy most resplendent Beauty which Thou didst reveal unto Him through one of Thy names. Through it did the Beloved One turn to the Ultimate Tree to hear Thy call, O Source of bounty. Through it did every Prophet cry “Here am I, here am I, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of earth and heaven!” Through it were the gates of Thy knowledge opened before the faces of Thy creation and the portals of Thy gifts before Thy servants and creatures. When Thou didst desire to manifest Thy oneness, Thou didst manifest its Source and Origin through the power of Thy might and strength. Through Him was established the oneness of Thy Essence among Thy servants and the singleness of Thy Self among Thy creation. Thou hast ordained no portion for anyone except through his acknowledgment of His singleness and confession of His oneness, for through Him is established Thy manifestation and sovereignty, Thy emergence and power. O Lord! Aid Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to hold fast to the cord of Thy favors, that they may recognize the Source of Thy verses and the Dayspring of Thy clear signs. Then send down, O my God, upon him who hath turned to the ocean of Thy generosity and the horizon of Thy bestowal that which Thou didst send down upon the sincere ones among Thy chosen ones and the near ones among Thy loved ones, that he may arise wholly to serve Thy Cause and to spread Thy verses and mention Thy clear signs.

<p>O esteemed Hakim! In the Name of Him Who is the Guardian over all names! There can be no doubt that the Ancient Lord created the people of the world for His own recognition, and the tradition “I was a hidden treasure” bears witness to this statement. Every insightful mystic testifies that the Ancient Being has ever been and will ever be sanctified above manifestation, appearance and the recognition of created things, and exalted above forms, temples and the comprehension of beings. None shall attain to His recognition save through His Dawning-Place of signs and Manifestation of evidences. In every age and cycle when the Sun of inner meanings dawned from the horizon of divine will, all people arose in rejection and opposition, except whom thy Lord wished, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The cause and reason for people’s rejection were the divines of the age, for the reins of the people were and are in their hands. Observe how at the time of the appearance of the Sun of Truth from the horizon of Hijaz, how many divines, learned ones and leaders arose with utmost effort and striving to extinguish the Muhammadan Light - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. Nay, the curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! Likewise before Him, consider Jesus son of Mary - after He manifested God’s Cause, all Jewish divines denounced Him as an infidel, while some souls who were occupied with fishing attained the honor of faith. Similarly before Him, consider Moses. It would be most regrettable if these days should pass and one such as yourself should not find their fragrance. Say: O God of Names and Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Name to assist me in recognizing the Dawning-Place of Thy Cause and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. Then ordain for me what shall profit me in the hereafter and in this world. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Since this Wronged One inhaled the fragrances of love and fairness from you, He therefore engaged in mentioning this letter. Verily the Cause is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>

<p>The Unseen beareth witness unto Its own Self that verily I am God, there is none other God but Me. I have manifested that which I desired before the faces of the servants - among them are those who saw and believed, those who turned toward it yet hesitated, and those who testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath testified in this mighty and impregnable station, which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names by God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. He whom I loved hath appeared before the Wronged One and asked from the Most Great Ocean. We have made mention of thee and have sent down for thee this Tablet that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Thou art he to whom the Supreme Pen hath testified in numerous Tablets and for whom it hath revealed that which neither the veils of the world can conceal nor the clamor of the nations can alter. It shall remain shining, through the perpetuity of the Kingdom and the Dominion, from the horizon of the heaven of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. This is a word that all the books of the world cannot equal - a bounty from Him unto thee. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. When thou hearest the scratching of My Pen and findest the fragrance of My raiment, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I testify that Thou hast aided Thine Afnan to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance and to hold fast unto that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book, and hast written for them from the Pen of bounty that which none knoweth save Thyself. I beseech Thee by Thy signs whereby Thy proof hath been perfected amongst Thy creation and Thy testimony amongst Thy servants, and by Thy clear tokens before which all signs bowed down at the revelation of the lights of the Orb of Thy manifestation, that Thou wilt exalt me through Thy Name, draw me nigh through Thy generosity, and assist me to arise for Thy Cause in every world of Thy worlds. I testify that Thy grace withholdeth not those who seek Thee, Thy bounty disappointeth not those who hope in Thee, and Thy loving-kindness forsaketh not those who yearn for Thee. O my Lord! Thou beholdest me gazing toward Thy horizon and awaiting the wonders of Thy bounty and mercy. I beseech Thee by Thy call between earth and heaven, and by Thy sovereignty which hath subdued all things, that Thou wilt preserve me from the doubts of Thine enemies and the allusions of those who have turned away from Thy Cause among Thy creatures.

He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. When the horizon of manifestation did shine forth and the birds did warble upon the branches, then were the eyes of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, dimmed. They behold the Most Great Ocean before their faces, yet turn away from it and cling to a mere pond. The Tongue of Grandeur calleth them at all times and summoneth them to His most exalted horizon, yet the people remain heedless. We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee with these verses, through which the fragrance of the divine Robe hath been wafted throughout the world, as every discerning scholar doth testify.</p>
<p>God willing, may you ever speak in remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility. All that thou beholdest today hath no permanence - all shall pass away and sovereignty shall remain with God and His loved ones. Observe how many souls depart this world each day, whether through calamities that descend or through wars that occur. It is entirely clear and evident that none of these things did profit those souls, nor ever shall. That which would have profited them they did not acquire, but rather turned away from it. Surely no person of perfect understanding would set their heart upon a station that passeth away like the blowing of winds - neither rejoicing in its elevation nor sorrowing at its abasement. Blessed is the state of that soul who hath been delivered from this whirlpool and hath found intimacy with the Divine Beloved. Such a one is as a star in the heaven of true knowledge, and their light shall endure forever. We make mention of him who hath turned toward God, that his remembrance may endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing Witness.

Blessed art thou, for God hath named thee the first pillar of the two Names derived from this Name, before which all who are in the heavens and earth were struck with terror, all faces were transformed, all feet did stumble, and the skin of every sinful unbeliever did quiver. Glad tidings unto thee, O servant, for thou didst draw nigh unto God and didst detach thyself from those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, and didst turn thy face toward God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Therefore, rejoice within thyself, for God hath magnified thy face from this Prison and doth make mention of thee at this moment with such remembrances through which all things were created from a beginning that hath no beginning, through which spirits were raised up and lights did shine. Thus doth God give unto whomsoever He willeth from the Kawthar of grace and bounty, and clotheth with the robe of forgiveness those who were martyred in His path and soared in the atmosphere of nearness on two wings of detachment. Thus doth God single out whomsoever He willeth through a command from His presence. There is no God but Him, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. He forgiveth whomsoever He willeth through His sovereignty and chastiseth whomsoever He desireth through His command. He shall not be questioned about what He doeth.

Rejoice within yourselves and grieve not over anything, for your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath ordained for you in Paradise a station that none knoweth save God, the One, the All-Seeing. Were you to witness the station of Our servant in the highest Paradise, you would beseech God to raise you up unto him. But it hath been veiled from you by a wisdom that none hath comprehended save God, Who perceiveth all vision while no vision perceiveth Him. Were people to become aware of the station that God hath ordained for those who were martyred in His path, they would sacrifice their own souls in hope of attaining that station. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Effulgent. Glory be upon him and upon you, O dwellers of the pavilion of glory, from this Beauty from Whose face suns have dawned and from Whose brow moons have shone forth.</p>

Were they to hear it, the rapture of longing would seize them to such degree that they would dance and not even perceive it.</p>
<p>Say: Do ye abandon the cup of immortality and take the putrid water of extinction from the hand of every rejected transgressor? Say: Hath the teacher of desire taught you this, or your own selves? Be truthful with Me, O people, and follow not every veiled liar. Arise with wisdom and remind the servants of what the Lord of creation hath commanded you, that perchance they may turn unto God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>Thus hath My Pen spoken, My Tongue uttered, and My limbs testified. Blessed is he who hath drawn near and taken the Tablet of God with the hand of power and drunk therefrom what was inscribed in My Preserved Tablet. O thou who drinkest from My cup and speaketh in My Name! Give thanks for what hath been sent down to thee from the heaven of providence - this irrevocable Book.</p>

<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>We have sent down the Book of Names from the heaven of God’s Will, the Creator of the heavens, wherein We gave glad tidings to the world of this glorious and wondrous Day. Therein We counseled every name through the Most Great Name and commanded it to abandon all it possessed on the Day of Manifestation, when the Temple of God was established upon the throne of His Great Name. We taught every name My way and made known to it Him Who would come with clear sovereignty. Yet when He came, all the names denied Him, save those whom God, the Lord of the worlds, willed. Among them were those who said “He hath not come; He will come hereafter,” and those who said “He hath falsely laid claim against the One, the All-Informed.” Say: By what proof do ye establish your claims and by what evidence do ye prove your position? Bring it forth if ye be among those who know. Say: By God! The proof weepeth at what ye have wrought, and the evidence waileth like unto those who have lost their beloved ones. They have clung to their idle fancies and turned away from God, the Mighty, the Wise. Verily he who pronounced death upon those who turned to the Supreme Horizon arose to slay Me. When God revealed what was hidden in his breast, he cried out within himself and denied what he had committed. To this testify those servants who were with Me in the Land of Mystery, and beyond them is a Preserved Tablet. We made known to him Our horizon and commanded him to do what was right, yet he arose to harm Me and committed that which caused the hearts of those near unto God to melt. Say: O people! The Revealer of the Bayan said: “O peoples of all possibilities! Ye were created that your names might be mentioned before the Throne.” Fear God and be not among the veiled ones. Beware lest ye object to God or turn away from Him through Whom every wise command was revealed. O thou who hast turned to the Countenance! When thou hast drunk the choice wine of knowledge from the ocean of My utterance, remind the people of what hath been revealed in the Tablet, that they may arise to what they missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. By My life! We see them not in wakefulness, but rather in their ancient stupor. Remind them with wisdom, that perchance My beautiful remembrance may influence them. The glory be upon thee and upon him who hath opened his eyes in God, the Goal of the sincere ones.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Affairs have so transformed that thou seest vultures dwelling in palaces while the Sovereign of the Kingdom resideth in the most ruined of houses. Thus hath the matter been decreed by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. God hath made their palaces their tombs. Well is it with them that possess insight! They whose eyes have been illumined with guidance in the days of their Most Glorious Lord - these see not things but they first perceive their eventual passing. By My life! Through them doth the earth yield its fruits and the clouds pour down their rain. The world, at every moment, calleth out to man, saying: “Dost thou expect fidelity from me? Evil is that which thou hast imagined! Soon shalt thou find thyself in abasement and loss.” Well is it with him who casteth it behind him, turning unto the Dawning-Place of lights. Say: The world is that which preventeth you from God, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Among men is he who maketh his religion his world and it preventeth him from the straight path, and among them is he who maketh his asceticism his world while he remaineth in heedlessness and error, and among them is he who maketh his poverty the world itself while remaining unaware of his condition. Thus have We detailed the matter in the Scriptures and Tablets. Rend ye the veils! This is the Lord of lords Who hath come with the Kingdom of verses. Among men is he who hath clung to the Evil One, turning away from the Kingdom. Say: Woe unto thee, O thou who associateth partners with God and doubteth! We have manifested the Cause in such wise that necks have been humbled before it. Whoso drinketh from this cup, neither the cawing of the deniers nor the clouds of allusions shall shut him out. How many a wise one hath been veiled from the Sun by clouds of fancy, and how many a child hath rent asunder the veils! How many a person of understanding hath been confounded within himself, and how many a heedless one hath advanced until he entered the Kingdom of his Lord, the Exalted, the Most High! Say: Grace is in the hand of God - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth of His creation. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Forgiving. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him! Woe unto every proud oppressor! Thus have We cast upon thee and sent down unto thee verses that nothing in earth or heaven can equal, that the breezes of revelation might seize thee in these days wherein the Dove hath warbled and the Raven hath cawed. And the glory be upon thee and upon every patient believer.</p>

<p>Muhammad-’Ali! Most holy, most exalted! Your letter was received wherein you sought to test your Lord, the Most High, the Great. This is what you have been forbidden in all the Tablets. Read the books of the past, that you may be of those who understand. All that hath been manifested in this Revelation is the proof of God amongst His servants and His testimony unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. None may test his Lord - rather God testeth whomsoever He willeth of His servants. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He pleaseth. Would you say what the ancients said? Read the Furqan and after it the Bayan, that you may be of those who are informed. We love not what beseemeth thee not - this is of My favor unto thee, that thou mayest be of the thankful. Make not thy faith contingent upon what thou desirest, but rather upon what God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, hath desired. When the breezes of revelation waft over thee and the attraction of the divine Word draweth thee to the kingdom of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then shall be made manifest unto thee what thou didst desire, and thou shalt witness God’s power and knowledge over all created things. How many servants desired what thou didst desire, yet when We made it manifest unto them, they said: “This is manifest sorcery!” Ask thou Baghdad and its environs, and other lands besides, that thou mayest be assured that thy Lord is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Is there any excuse left for anyone in this Revelation? No, by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne! My signs have encompassed the earth, and My power enveloped all mankind, and yet the people are wrapped in a strange sleep! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou knowest that I have summoned the servants unto naught save the court of Thy gifts and favors, and have manifested unto them, by Thy leave, that which hath no likeness in creation. I beseech Thee, O Possessor of invention, that Thou transmute the base metal of existence into pure gold through the elixir of Thy wisdom and loving-kindness. Then reveal unto them from Thy comprehensive Book of Divination that which will render them independent through Thine independence. I testify, O my God, that with Thee is the knowledge of all things. I beseech Thee by Thy Self to make known unto the servants the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, that they may find in His every attribute the fragrances of Thy knowledge and the sweet scents of Thy power. Then cause them to be so detached from all else but Thee that they will choose for themselves what Thou hast chosen for them through the sovereignty of Thy decree. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Most holy, most holy! Your letter has reached Our presence and We found it adorned with the remembrance of God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. We have read it as a token of Our grace - verily your Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. The world has been set ablaze by the heat of your Lord the All-Merciful’s utterance, yet most people remain heedless. We have made heat the cause of motion, and We have sanctified it above the types of motion mentioned in the books of men, for it has appeared from thy Lord’s word without how or gesture. Reflect and be of the thankful. The world moves by this motion and the celestial spheres rotate by the name of your Ancient Lord. Can you remain still while the Spirit soars between the heavens and earth? Can you be patient while the Most Great Temple cries out with His wondrous name? It has seized those who were prevented by the moisture of vain imaginings and moved those who turned to the heat of My Name, the Beloved, Who is the Best-Beloved. Thus does the ocean of utterance flow forth from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Aware. O Muhammad! Give thanks to God for having accepted your turning to Him and for having mentioned your name before the Throne and for the Tongue of Grandeur having spoken your name while in the prison of the heedless. Do not grieve over what has befallen Us, for My soul longs for tribulation to establish the Cause of your Lord, the King of Names. This is more glorious to Me than all else and sweeter than all sweetness, were you to know. Remember My tribulations, My oppression, My imprisonment and My affliction, that perchance those who sleep on the couch of heedlessness and passion may awaken and remember their Lord, the All-Bountiful. O Muhammad! It behooves you to remember My tribulations, and it behooves Me to manifest the ocean of My patience. Thus have We divided the work between Me and you. Rejoice in these words that have perfumed the worlds. What We mention of patience and forbearance is for Our servants. By My life! When tribulation appears We give thanks to God, Creator of the heavens, and leave patience to the patient ones. When tribulation appears it behooves His servants to thank Him. But when We see them in weakness We command them to be patient. Thus do We explain for you that you may be of those who know. May glory be upon you and upon those who have arisen to serve God when He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Fire hath appeared and the Light hath shone forth in this Revelation wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: “Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.” Indeed the Fire speaketh from the luminous Spot: “He Who is the Lord of earth and heaven hath come with manifest sovereignty.” The call of the Tree hath been raised upon the Sinai of the Command, and that which was concealed in the Books of God hath been revealed, and that which was inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of the kingdom of names and of heaven, hath appeared. Blessed is the stranger who hath hastened to his most exalted home, and the poor one who hath hurried to the treasury of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the thirsty one who hath made his way to the Most Great Ocean, and the one who, having remained seated, hath arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: The Lamp of bounty hath appeared in the world and from the horizon of justice hath dawned the Sun of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrance of the All-Merciful been wafted. Happy is he who hath drunk the first and attained unto the second in the days of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. O My Most Exalted Pen! Thy scratching sound hath been raised and thy fragrance diffused, after We found thee silent and still in this praiseworthy station. It saith: “O my Lord, the All-Loving! I chose silence, for I was bewildered by Thy Cause and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty. Thou art, verily, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. By Thy might! Such bewilderment seized me that I forgot myself, my station, my scratching sound and my movement. Thou art the Witness of what I say. I observe that they who were created from the spray of the ocean of Thy utterance by Thy command have risen up to harm Thy Self, yet Thou didst forbear despite Thy power and didst forgive though Thou wert able to subdue all who dwell in the realms of might.” Thus did My Pen speak, but the people do not understand. When thou art intoxicated with the wine of My knowledge and seized by the fragrance of Mine utterance, turn thy face toward the Prison and say: “Perdition betide them that have wronged and imprisoned Thee, and woe unto them that have turned away from Thy face after God had made it the qiblih of all existence.” Glory be upon thee and upon them that have shattered the idols of vain imaginings through this Name whereby that which was recorded in the Scrolls of God, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved, hath been made manifest.</p>

The Glory calleth out: “Where are the people of fidelity whose faces reflect the radiance of God, the Lord of Names? These are servants by whom the horizon of certitude hath shone forth. The All-Merciful sendeth blessings upon them at all times. They are among the bearers of the Throne amidst all worlds. God hath singled them out for this greatest bounty and preferred them above all who dwell upon the earth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily, they who are heedless this day - their names shall not be mentioned before the Throne, except that they are among the losers. Soon shall they behold the recompense of what they have wrought in the days of God. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. He recompenseth every soul for what it hath earned. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. He desireth naught for His servants save their drawing nigh unto Him, yet today they are among the drowned, except for him whom the hand of grace hath saved and drawn nigh to the holy court and made to be among the triumphant. Verily, the Cause is in the grasp of His power. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. And remember when the Bearer of Glad-Tidings came unto them and informed them of this Great Announcement. But when He came with the truth, the people differed concerning Him. Among them were those who denied and rejected the proof of the All-Merciful when He appeared with manifest sovereignty. And among them were those who said: ‘He hath appeared contrary to our imaginings.’ Thus did their souls beguile them on this wondrous Day. And among them were those who said: ‘He must follow what we possess.’ Say: Rather is He more worthy to be followed, did ye but understand. Say: He is the One Whom the world must obey. He hath created all things for His following. This is what hath been decreed in the Tablet, were ye of those who know. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Chooser of whatsoever He desireth. None hath the right to hesitate in what hath been sent down from His presence, and whoso hesitateth is assuredly among the companions of the Fire. O people! Look not unto what ye possess, but unto what hath been sent down from your Lord, the All-Knowing. Be thou thankful unto God for having attained unto the Most Great Sea and been numbered among those who have turned unto Him.

<p>O He Who is denoted by H, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God! In the Name of the Peerless Friend! The Supreme Pen has, in most Tablets, enjoined wisdom upon the loved ones of God, and has made wisdom the very foundation. Nevertheless, some have transgressed therefrom and have caused the barking of dogs and the clamor of the masses, as you have heard. Had the accepted servants acted according to the commandments of the Lord of the Worlds, surely the fragrances of the chastisement would have encompassed the idolators and hypocrites. Although the Beauty, upon Him be the Glory of God, intended to assist the Cause, yet since it occurred contrary to God’s command, it became the cause of the veiling of many. Most people are weak - at the mere utterance of a word they become agitated and fearful. In this Day no helper for the Truth has been or is mightier and more powerful than wisdom. Blessed is he who has turned unto it and has held fast unto it by the command of his Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing. Strange that some souls have not yet realized that the appointed time is fixed - it neither hastens nor tarries. Today everyone must follow God’s command and nothing contrary to wisdom should proceed from him. In such case, should the manifestations of tyranny and wickedness arise to shed his blood, no harm shall come to pass, for it will have occurred in the path of God, and every soul shall taste of the cup of death. And if this inevitable decree occurs for the sake of God, it is surely better and more beloved. The strong must at all times be mindful of the weak. Verily His mercy has preceded all worlds. Blessed art thou for having fulfilled God’s Covenant and held fast unto the wisdom wherewith thou wert commanded in the Books and Tablets. Gladden the loved ones in that land with divine favors and heavenly bounties. There hath befallen them what befell God’s chosen ones of old. We were truly witness. Convey My greetings unto H. Verily he is among those mentioned before the Throne. Upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, and upon thy other brother, and upon those who are with thee, and upon the loved ones of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Hearken once again unto the Call from the direction of the luminous Spot, the place wherefrom the Lord of Names doth speak and summon all to the supreme horizon, as bidden by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

He Whom ye have mentioned in the nights and days hath come, as attesteth the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: Have vain imaginings prevented you from the Lord of all beings, or the might of tyrants from this momentous Cause? Observe, then remember: When Moses came, Pharaohs opposed Him and pronounced judgment against Him without any clear proof from God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Then remember when the Spirit came, the Jews rose against Him with such tyranny as caused the dwellers of the Kingdom of your Lord, the Possessor of this wondrous Day, to lament. Then remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, appeared with clear signs: the people denied Him and committed that which caused the denizens of the highest Paradise and the companions of the Crimson Ark–who offered up their souls and all they possessed in the path of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment–to weep. No Messenger appeared but the people turned away from Him, and no Prophet came but they denied Him and stoned Him with the stones of their idle fancies. Of this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book. Give thanks, O Husayn, to thy Lord, for He hath aided thee, prospered thee, and drawn thee nigh until He caused thee to enter a station wherein thou didst hear His mighty and glorious Call. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and say: I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens, by the ocean of Thy names and by Thy Name at Whose manifestation the dwellers of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms did prostrate themselves, to preserve me and strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause, the most mighty, ancient and all-glorious.

<p>O Muhammad! Hear the call from the direction of grandeur - verily He remembers you with that which draws you near and calls you to that which uplifts you. He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be!” and it is. The door of grace has been opened to all who are on earth and in heaven, as testified by Him Who possesses the secrets of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>We bear witness that you departed from your homeland, turning toward the Most Exalted Homeland, the station wherein speaks the Supreme Pen, until you arrived and attained His presence and heard the call of the Wronged One. Give thanks to your Lord, for He has aided you to turn toward Him, to attain His presence, and to hearken to His sweetest call by which the people of the graves have arisen.</p>
<p>Remind My servants on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My loving-kindness. We counsel all to uprightness, religiosity and that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, may be exalted.</p>
<p>O Karim! We have remembered your father and mother before, and adorned them with the ornament of forgiveness. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the Kind, the Forgiving. And We remember those in your household and give them the glad tidings of My mercy which has preceded existence itself.</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! Beware lest names keep you back from their Creator. Cast them behind you, turning with your hearts to God, the Mighty, the Loving. The croaking of hypocrisy has risen in all directions - this is what We foretold you before and in this inscribed Tablet.</p>
<p>O Karim! Hear the call of your Lord, the Merciful. He left one place and shone forth from the horizon of another place, and drank tea. Then He revealed for you that from which the sincere perceive the fragrance of loving-kindness and favors, and those near to God inhale the fragrance of the garment of their Lord, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have cast behind them the idle fancies of men, turning to God, the Mighty, the Great. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>The Most Holy, Most Exalted Book of Glory hath been sent down from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. From the horizon of tribulation it beareth glad-tidings unto all creation. The Face hath appeared and the Sun of the Cause hath risen from the Dayspring of the Will of their Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Blessed is he in whose heart the breezes of his Lord’s days have stirred, and woe betide the heedless ones who followed vain imaginings and who, when the Lord of all beings appeared, broke the Covenant and were numbered with the deniers. Know they whither they flee? Are they aware whither they run? Nay, by the Lord of what was and what shall be! They are among those who wander distracted. We behold them wrapped in the veils of fancy after We commanded them to rend them asunder, and We see them in the shadows of glory after the Beauty hath shone forth from this manifest horizon. I know not by what excuse they would justify themselves when questioned. Nay, by My soul! God’s proof hath been perfected against them and His testimony completed unto all who dwell in the realms of creation. That which they possess shall not be accepted from them. Soon shall the breaths of chastisement seize them from the presence of One Who is Mighty, Ancient. O thou who hast turned towards Me! Reflect upon what hath befallen the Beloved and His arising to promote the Cause. Then shalt thou find thyself in a station wherein thou wilt arise to aid the Cause of thy Ancient Lord. Blessed art thou and thy father. We bear witness that he is among those who have attained. The Most Exalted Pen hath been moved to make mention of him and shall continue to do so throughout the eternity of God. Thus doth God single out whom He pleaseth through His bounty. He is verily the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Arise to make mention of Me amongst My creatures, then call to mind what hath befallen this Wronged One when He was a stranger in the hands of the oppressors. Forget not God’s favor unto thee when the gaze of His mercy was directed towards thee over the course of several years, and His tongue speaketh in remembrance of thee in this remote prison. We beseech God to aid thee in all conditions and to assist thee in His triumph among His servants. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses and dispatched them to thee, and before them was sent down a glorious Tablet, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord and be assured that He remembereth him who hath uttered His mention. He is verily the Protector of those who remember Him. May the glory rest upon you and upon those with you and upon them that observe God’s right concerning you. They are surely among the doers of good. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Haji Muhammad-Rida!</p>
<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Guardian over all names! This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the Lord of all worlds. It gives glad tidings to those who have believed of that which none before has ever attained. To this bears witness He Who has summoned all from the Most Great Prison to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who has cast away vain desire and turned to the supreme horizon, and woe unto those who have turned away by following every ignorant remote one.</p>
<p>Your mention has been made before the Wronged One, and a noble Book has been revealed for you. Verily it will benefit you in all the worlds of your Lord and draw you nigh unto a station which pens and every reckoner of knowledge are powerless to describe. Be steadfast in the Cause and mindful of what was mentioned before from this Great Announcement. Beware lest the affairs of men prevent you from the Lord of the first and the last. Leave the people behind you, turning to the horizon which has been illumined by this wondrous Name.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that through divine grace you have attained and recognized His days. Strive that you may achieve deeds whose mention shall endure throughout the eternity of God’s names. Give thanks to your Lord for this wise remembrance. This Day is exceedingly great, yet most of the servants are heedless of it. Love of transient affairs and earthly ornaments has prevented all from the King of Oneness. They are seen immersed in the sea of negligence and will soon surrender their souls to the master of hell. We beseech God that the world’s vanities may not prevent accepted and steadfast souls from everlasting stations.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be to Thee, O Thou by Whose Name the created things were attracted and through Whose remembrance all possible things have testified! I beseech Thee by the Revealer of Thy verses and the Dayspring of Thy clear signs to assist me to be steadfast in Thy love and Thy Cause, and to enable me to do what befits Thy Revelation and Thy days, and whereby my mention may endure throughout the eternity of Thy dominion and Thy kingdom. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the outpourings of the heaven of Thy grace. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth!</p>

<p>Muhammad Sadiq of Lahijan, named ‘Purpose of the World’, has attained the Most Great Horizon. Praise be to God, the fragrance of divine love wafted from him. Verily, the grace of thy Lord is great, great indeed, and what thou desired of forgiveness - verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Oft-Returning, the Kind, the Generous. His ocean of mercy hath no end and the heaven of His grace hath had and will have no limit. At all times one must take refuge in the Truth from evil, deceitful souls, for they have striven mightily to lead pure souls astray. Hold fast to the firm, strong handle in such wise that none can cause thee to deviate from it. The Truth is manifest and His Cause hath dawned from the horizon of might, and unto Him have ended the heavenly Books and revealed Scriptures and precious Tablets. Whosoever claimeth for himself a station, he is a liar and calumniator in the Book of God, and will continue to be. Through divine grace thou must be so firm and steadfast in the Cause that if thine eye were to oppose thee, thou wouldst pass it by - how much more rejected, deluded souls. Any soul who today maketh a claim or pretendeth to inner knowledge, he is Satan to the true party. Thus do some souls outwardly utter one word while inwardly speaking another word contrary to the outward - such a soul hath been and will be a hypocrite and liar. The people of truth are those who regard as false whatever they see contrary to the outward Cause of God. The inner, and inner of the inner of the inner, circleth round this outward. Blessed is the soul that hath found the fragrance of the divine utterance and is among the steadfast ones. Hearken to the divine counsel which hath been sent down from the heaven of the merciful Will out of love for His creation in this blessed leaf, and praise the Beloved of the world Who hath adorned thee with the robe of forgiveness and pardoned what occurred and recorded thy name in the divine Tablets. Strive henceforth to be engaged in mentioning the Cause and serving it. Verily, He is the protector of whoever befriendeth Him. There is no God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who speaketh, manifest and evident. The living waters from the Pen of the All-Merciful flow and stream forth at all times, and these are the cause of eternal existence and everlasting life. Yet most souls remain unaware thereof and deprived of any portion from the direction of the Most Great Scene. A few, through divine assistance, have attained unto this most great bounty. They are the source of good deeds and the manifestations of names and attributes. It is binding and incumbent upon such souls to arise with the utmost endeavor and wisdom to awaken the people of the world from the slumber of heedlessness through goodly remembrances and guide them to the Source of mercy. Blessed art thou for having attained unto faith and certitude and for having arisen to serve thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And if ye observe among those who have turned to God a soul who is capable of teaching this irresistible Cause of God and is adorned with the qualities mentioned in the Tablets, his turning to various regions for the purpose of spreading the Cause according to the wisdom revealed in the Tablets hath been and will be beloved. And in all conditions one must observe wisdom, for the people are weak and far removed from the root of the Cause. We beseech God to assist thee in all circumstances even as He hath aided thee at all times, and to grant thee the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Convey My greetings to thy son who turned to the Goal and returned from what he was forbidden, and to all men and women who are with thee. The glory be upon thee and upon them from thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. O Ahmad, convey My greetings to My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of this wise remembrance. O loved ones of the All-Merciful in Milan! Hearken unto what the Prisoner calleth you from this mighty Prison. Gather ye together in the love of God and His praise, then unite in this mighty Cause. Beware lest the veils of the world prevent you. Turn with radiant faces unto God, the Lord of eternity. Verily He is with you at all times. Thus have We sent unto you the fragrances of the All-Merciful from this glorious and wondrous Garden.</p>

<p>O Muhsin, upon thee be the Glory of God! M.H.S. Hearken unto that which the Dayspring of Names calleth out to thee while encompassed by grievous tribulation. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Powerful. Mention hath been made of grievous tribulation that the people of creation might flee therefrom, yet it is a gracious tribulation inasmuch as We have accepted it in the path of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Say: Should He desire to make mention, the cawing of all them that dwell on earth could not silence Him, and should He desire to arise, the hosts of heaven and earth could not cause Him to sit. Nothing can withstand His Cause, nor can adversity prevent Him. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All things have been sullied by what hath welled up in the breasts from the fire of hatred, yet the Cause remaineth unsullied - neither the opposition of the wicked nor the imaginings of them that have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Most Praised, can ever sully it. He, verily, is the One Who prevaileth over all who are in heaven and on earth. Soon will His banner be raised upon every lofty and towering mountain. We have lit the lamp of victory at the midmost heart of creation and preserved it, when the winds blew from every direction, with the glass of power and might. Thy Lord, verily, is the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who draweth nigh and is illumined by this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Will of his Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Be thou assured through thy Lord’s grace. We make mention of thee in truth. Our mention, verily, hath preceded all who make mention. Thy letter hath come before the Face, and through this God hath forgiven thy kinsmen and ordained for thee a station which none can comprehend save those whom He hath specially chosen for the service of the Dayspring of His firm and mighty Cause. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as from thy letter wafted the fragrance of faithfulness and from it were diffused the sweet savors of the love of Him Who is the Creator of the heavens. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. We have answered thee in days wherein eyes were dazed, hearts were troubled, and limbs did quake from the fear that encompassed all men. Thus doth the Lord of all beings recount unto thee in a perspicuous Tablet. Give praise for thy letter having been accepted before the Throne and having attained unto this glorious presence. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have been illumined by the lights of the Countenance when it shone forth from the horizon of God, the Almighty, the August, the Most Beautiful.</p>

<p>The fire of the All-Merciful from the Divine Lote-Tree in the human realm blazeth forth in truth in this Ridvan, and every ember thereof proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him, and that He, verily, hath ever been independent of all worlds. Through it the warmth of the love of the Beloved is kindled in hearts, and the Beloved draweth souls unto an exalted and impregnable sanctuary. Through it are the hearts of lovers set aflame, and they become detached from all else. Thus hath the decree been inscribed in truth by the Most Exalted Pen upon the White Tablet.</p>
<p>God well knoweth that thou hast been set aflame by this fire and hast been attracted by the melodies of God. Preserve thou the fire, lest it be extinguished by the waters of idle fancies of those who have denied God and been deprived of the breezes of holiness. Arise to promote the Cause of God and convey unto men these tidings which have caused all who are in the heavens and on earth to tremble, save those whom God hath protected through His manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>Say: O people! The test hath come to you from the direction of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and at this moment the idolaters are in great turmoil. Say: This trial is a trial for those who have not drunk from the cup of certitude offered by the Youth of the All-Merciful, Who was sent forth from the light of the Throne. As to those who have partaken thereof, their feet shall never slip from aught, for they are they who have taken for themselves a secure station beneath the shadow of the All-Merciful. Neither the tempests of trials nor the storms of tribulations can move them, for they are preserved within the stronghold of God’s protection. Upon them do the dwellers of Paradise shower their blessings, morning and evening.</p>
<p>Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth and revealed unto thee that which rejoiceth thy heart and the hearts of all who are endowed with insight. Convey thou the greetings from God unto the faces of them that have believed in God and are steadfast in His Cause. Lead thou the people into the religion of God and tarry not even for a moment, for this is the glory of the servant in this Day wherein God hath brought forth a wondrous Cause.

No praise can attain unto this station, for all praise is bounded by the limitations of souls, while this station is exalted above all mention and description, and in its primary aspect and supreme state is sanctified from all enumeration. Praise be to God! Thou hast quaffed from the wine of utterance in the name of the Best-Beloved of all worlds. This is that same wine that hath been sealed from eternity and hidden from all beings. In this most great Revelation, the finger of divine will hath broken its seal and proclaimed: Come ye, come ye, O people of Baha! Come ye, come ye, O companions of the Crimson Ark! Come ye, come ye, O friends of God, with pure hearts, unto the most exalted horizon! When thou hast been blessed with My call and the traces of My pen, say: My God, my God! Separation from Thee hath set me ablaze, remoteness from Thee hath seized my spirit, and distance from the precincts of Thy nearness is my greatest enemy.

O Lord! Withhold not from those who seek Thee the ocean of Thy bounty, nor from those who love Thee the precincts of Thy nearness. Thou art He at Whose call the dwellers of the graves arose, the trumpet was sounded, and that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge and preserved in the treasury of Thy protection was made manifest. I beseech Thee not to disappoint Thy servant of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trusted ones.

<p>This is a letter from the servant to those who have been illumined by the lights of their Lord’s countenance, the Mighty, the Bestower, who have detached themselves from the world and whatever was created therein, and who have turned with spirit and fragrance toward the Dayspring of the Cause. O servant! Hear My call from the direction of the prison that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Compassionate. Detach thyself from all else save God and arise to aid His Cause in these days wherein most of the people have veiled themselves from Him Who came to them from the Dayspring of the Command with power and sovereignty. Soon shall they say: “Oh, woe unto us for what we neglected toward God and for our heedlessness and loss!” Hear thou My words and avoid those who have taken the Evil One as their lord instead of God - they are but the companions of delusion. Say: O people! Cast not the ordinances of God behind your backs. Fear ye the Day when souls shall be convulsed and foundations shall tremble. He commands you only that which draws you nigh unto Him. Fear God and be not of those who have shown pride toward God. Take for yourselves a path to the Divine good-pleasure. Beware, O people, lest ye transgress what hath been ordained in God’s Book and follow every doubting idolater. O people! Hesitate not in this Cause - it hath appeared in truth from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Purify your ears to hearken unto the Word of God, then your hearts from the mention of aught else, that the revelations of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Glorious, may be imprinted upon them. Would that thou hadst been with Us in those days and discovered what was concealed within the veils of power and grandeur! But what was decreed hath been decreed by thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Be content with what God hath decreed for thee and say: “Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name whereby Thou hast guided them that know unto the court of Thy good-pleasure and them that are sincere unto the realm of Thy decree, that Thou leave me not to myself and my desires. Raise me up through Thy sovereignty to the heights of knowledge that I may know Thee by Thy Self and detach myself from all else besides Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest and verily Thou art the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>

<p>This is an epistle from the Prisoner to him who hath been guided by the lights of the Spirit in this Dawn which hath been illumined by the splendors of the Face, and who hath been attracted by the melodies of his Lord in days which were promised in the Tablet. Blessed art thou for having tasted of the fruits of the Tree of God in this Springtime wherein the temples of them that are detached were adorned with the ornament of a wondrous Name. Say: O people! Were ye troubled for your own sakes in the days of tribulation after We had forewarned you thereof in a mighty and impregnable Tablet? Say: We loved the Spirit and preserved it that We might sacrifice it in the path of God - and God Himself is witness to what I say - and besides this nothing profiteth Us, nor would We turn Our attention to it for less than a moment. Say: O people! Were We to lift the veil from your faces, ye would sacrifice your very souls with your own hands that ye might attain the station which was raised up in truth through the Word of God. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear your Lord, the All-Merciful, and deny not Him at whose mention alone the Most Exalted Pen hath moved. Consider what hath been revealed in the Bayan, that ye may perchance find a way unto God. Say: Reflect within yourselves for less than a moment why We have remained in this prison and borne what no other among all creation hath borne, that ye may arise from the slumber of vain desire and turn towards this Sun which hath dawned above the horizon of grace with manifest splendor.</p>
<p>Know thou that We had previously sent down verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee, but they who were heedless intervened between thee and them, and committed that which they were forbidden in a preserved Tablet. Grieve thou not, but be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor, for verily He is with thee and guardeth thee through His sovereign might, and He, verily, hath power over all things. Aid thy Lord to the extent of thy power - thus doth the Pen of Command enjoin thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed it from every direction and it remaineth solitary amidst the idolaters. And glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee, who have detached themselves from all directions and turned with radiant faces toward the Dayspring of Revelation.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Great! This is a Book which speaks with truth and commands the people to righteousness and justice from One All-Knowing, All-Wise, that they may know the path of truth and turn with their hearts to the Path of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Verily it is the Path of God for all who dwell in the heaven of command and creation, and the sign of His grandeur for those in the Concourse on High, and the manifestation of His power for those in the Kingdom of Names, and the Dawning-Place of His Cause for those in the supreme heaven, and the sign of His mercy for all in the heavens and earths. Say: The clouds of generosity rain down upon the peoples of all worlds at all times the showers of grace from the presence of One Mighty, Powerful. He shines forth upon all created things at all times with the lights of His luminous countenance. Among the people are those who have shattered the idols of desire through the power of the Lord of Names and have turned to God, the Beloved of the worlds. And among them are those who have clung to a name among names and have taken it as a helper for themselves without any proof or clear Book. Say: O people, do not associate partners with God - all atoms testify that He was One from time immemorial and has taken no partner unto Himself in sovereignty. Verily He is the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: O people of the Bayan! Are diverse lords better, or God, the One Powerful, Mighty, Peerless? Hold fast unto God and detach yourselves from all else - this is better for you, if you be of those who know. Soon you shall hear the call from those who desire to lead the servants astray. Beware lest you follow every remote calf. Soon shall you see one who claims for himself a cause - verily he is of the liars. At the time of departure from Iraq, a Tablet was revealed wherein We informed the servants of what would appear thereafter - verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And therein We made clear those who follow their desires and claim for themselves that which was not ordained for them from the presence of One Mighty, Powerful. Avoid those who are deluded by vain imaginings and idle fancies and are kept back from the remembrance of your Lord, the Lord of all mankind - verily they are among the losers. And be at peace through the grace of your Lord - verily He is with you at all times and ordains for you what He desires. Indeed His grace upon you is great. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>The Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! This is a day wherein the Beloved lamenteth and saith: Verily, the Best-Beloved is in manifest tribulation. And Moses crieth out, saying: O my Lord, the All-Bountiful! How long wilt Thou choose to forbear? Lo, the Dayspring of Thy Cause is in the hands of the oppressors. Draw forth from the sheath of Thy decree the sword of retribution, that the heads of the idolaters may be severed thereby. And the Spirit mourneth, saying: I would sacrifice myself that there might not befall Thee that which would sadden Thy heart. We behold Thee this day in such affliction as the eyes of the world have never witnessed. Would that I had never been sent down, nor been raised up, for by Thy Beauty, the All-Glorious, I cannot bear to see Thee among these who have disbelieved in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And the Countenance of the All-Merciful crieth out, saying: O people of the Bayan! Shame upon you! By God, ye have perpetrated what none among all created things hath ever perpetrated, though We counseled you in all the Tablets through this wondrous Remembrance. Ye heeded not My words, having followed the desires of them who turned away from the Face and opposed God, the Almighty, the Powerful. We counsel you and adjure you by God to hearken unto this word, if ye will hearken to none other: If ye believe not, harm Him not; if ye accept not, forsake Him not. The dwellers of the realms of eternity have lamented at what hath flowed from the Pen, while ye remain heedless. By My life! Baha calleth out between earth and heaven, whilst standing firm in that which He hath been commanded, His hands raised toward God, the Lord of Names, saying: I have chosen, in My love for Thee, the afflictions of all who are on earth, and I fear not, by Thy might and Thy power. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Naught grieveth Me save My tarrying in Thy Cause and My silence at the manifestations of Thy bestowals and the expressions of Thy favors. O my Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love. This is the desire of Baha in the kingdom of creation, and verily Thou art witness to what I say. Through Thy love nothing affrighteth me, and through my turning unto Thee the turning away of all who are on earth harmeth me not. By Thy might Thou didst raise me up, and by Thy command Thou didst cause me to speak forth in such wise that both young and old have heard Thy call. Thus have We cast upon thee, O thou who gazest upon thy Lord. When thou hast attained, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of them that know!</p>

<p>This is the Leaf of Eternity which hath stirred in the Paradise of the Tablet in the form of words, and from its movements and behavior a voice is heard whereto turn the faces of them that have recognized divine unity. They hear mention of this name which hath ascended unto God and was afflicted with tribulation in the path of his Lord. Thus hath the grace of God encompassed whomsoever He willeth of His creation, and verily His grace hath ever encompassed all the worlds.</p>
<p>O servant! Rejoice within thyself that thou wast confirmed in the good-pleasure of God and the recognition of His Self, and wast content with His good-pleasure until thou didst sacrifice thy spirit in His path. And verily We were with thee when thou didst ascend unto God with manifest humility and submission. Blessed art thou and blessed are they whom God hath associated with thee. Would that the servants might behold thee in the Most Exalted Paradise and become aware of what God hath ordained for thee in the sanctuaries of holy and transcendent glory. Thus doth God blot out the names of them that have disbelieved and associated partners with God, and confirmeth them that have believed and turned with pure hearts toward the court of God with an illuminating radiance.</p>
<p>And verily thou, O servant, rejoice within thyself in Paradise, for God hath at this moment magnified thy countenance and ordained for thee such good as none hath comprehended save His Self, Who hath encompassed all things in a Manifest Book. Soar with the two wings We have given thee, then wing thy flight in an atmosphere more subtle than spirit upon the face of a mirror and more delicate than light upon the face of a luminous crystal. Blessed art thou in that thou hast tasted the sweetness of the love of God, then drunk the cup of life in the life of life, and now drinkest from the chalice of glory at the very heart of Paradise, and art at all times gladdened by the fragrances of the All-Merciful. The mercy of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, descendeth upon thee at every moment, and the Tongue of Grandeur calleth out to thee from behind the veils of glory with melodies wondrous and true. And glory be upon thee and upon them that have been martyred in the path of God and upon them that shall be martyred in these days in this Cause, the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld, and God is witness unto this.</p>

<p>The All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Doth the Pen know? Say: Yea, by the glory of the Ancient Beauty! But most men perceive not. It soareth in the atmosphere of the Tablet through the attraction of revelation from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people! The Day is come and the Spirit proclaimeth in the Tablet: There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Is there doubt about the Manifestation or about His sovereignty? They have lost who denied God’s power after it encompassed every witness and witnessed thing. Would ye conceal the sun with the clay of idle fancies? Say: What aileth you that ye understand not? Do ye dispute with Him before Whom the verses have bowed down? Nay, they wander in the wilderness of error. Remaineth there any excuse for anyone? Nay, by the Book inscribed! Do ye see yourselves in the right? Nay, by the Preserved Tablet! When clear proofs appear they pant, and when verses are recited unto them they turn away. When asked by what evidence they believed in what came before, they cite that which refuteth them, yet comprehend not. Say: The verses have appeared from Our presence and the signs are fulfilled, when We came in the shadows of the attributes riding upon the clouds - yet most men are asleep. Say: Rend ye the veils, by the Lord of Lords! The Bestower hath come with manifest sovereignty. By My life! Those who answered not “Yea” after the Call was raised are counted as dead. See ye not the lights of this Dawn after it hath encompassed the horizons? Woe unto you for having cast behind your backs the Covenant and turned away from Him through Whom the eyes of the denizens of Paradise and those who circle round the Throne have been gladdened. Say: He chose tribulations for your ease, yet from Him ye flee. They hasten to the tyrant, turning away from the Kingdom. They are indeed a people in grievous loss. Blessed art thou, O servant, for thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne and verses have been sent down for thee which, were We to cast them upon the mountains, would transform them into rubies, and were their fragrances to pass over stones, rivers would burst forth from them by thy Lord’s permission, the Chosen One. He, verily, hath power over what was and what shall be. Remember thy Lord amongst His servants, that perchance the slumberers may awaken. The Spirit and glory rest upon thee and upon the people of Baha from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O Zabih, upon whom be the Glory of God! In the name of the merciful Lord! Your circumstances, whether traveling or at home, are known and mentioned before the Throne. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We complain of those who have created differences in the Cause of God, through whom the pure chalice of My recognition hath been sullied among My creatures, the sun of My sanctity hath been darkened, and the moon of My sovereignty hath been eclipsed. We created all for affection, fellowship, love and unity. We beseech God to assist all to achieve what He loves and is pleased with. He is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. O Zabih! Differences have been the cause of the dissipation of God’s Cause, while unity and accord are the cause of its exaltation. Blessed is he who hath forsaken the former and held fast unto the latter in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. You must in all conditions be engaged in serving the Cause and be the cause of unity among souls. The Supreme Pen hath at all times taught and commanded His loved ones to that which brings rest, ease and success, yet most are heedless of it. The horizon of guidance hath been darkened by the clouds of desire. The grief of this Wronged One hath not been from the oppression of oppressors, for whenever and at all times oppression against the Tree of the Cause occurred, it became the cause of its exaltation, as thou hast witnessed and dost witness. Rather, grief hath come from the deeds of some of the friends. This Wronged One beareth witness to this in this praiseworthy station. O Zabih! With utmost endeavor and diligence, be occupied with unifying hearts and bringing about accord among souls, that perchance the turbid winds may be stilled and the fragrance of love and purity may waft among the loved ones. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions to serve His Cause and to grant thee that which gladdens thy heart and solaces thine eyes. He is verily the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Youth hath presented himself before his Lord, and the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward him from this noble horizon. We shall send him to thee, if God willeth. He is verily the Bestower, the Bountiful, the All-Generous.

<p>O Abu-Javad! Hearken unto the Call from the Lord of creation on this Day of Return. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. This is the Day of which We have given tidings in the Tablets, saying that it would come, and when it came with the truth, the people turned away from it, save those whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, did will. Give thanks unto God for having caused thee to hear the cooing of the Dove upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree, and honored thee with the days of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. They who are heedless this Day are indeed among the most lost of men - soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the cawing of the infidels nor the utterances of the polytheists shall deter thee. Hold fast unto this strong and mighty cord - verily it is God’s handle between the heavens and the earth. Blessed is he that holdeth fast thereunto, and woe unto the heedless ones. The Lamentation hath wept for this Day, and the Interlocutor for this resplendent Beauty, while the Spirit crieth out in the wilderness: “The Beloved of the worlds hath come!” By God! The divine fragrance hath wafted, and the breeze hath blown, and there hath appeared from Zion that which was hidden, and the eternal Call of God is heard from this wondrous station. Is there anyone who perceiveth the fragrance of the Word that hath wafted from the Seat of authority? Nay, by My life, except whom thy Lord willeth, for the people are afflicted with a manifest cold. Know thou that thy son hath attained the presence of the Throne, and circled round it, and was illumined by its lights, and quaffed the wine of reunion from the cups of the favors of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. I bear witness that he is a righteous child. Give thanks for that which hath flowed in his behalf from the Supreme Pen, and be thou of the thankful ones. The world shall indeed pass away, and there shall remain for thee what hath been recorded by the Pen of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. By God! No created thing on earth can equal mention by Him in His remembrances - to this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning one. Convey My greetings unto thy wife, then give her the glad-tidings of this mercy which hath preceded all worlds.

The glory be upon thee and upon those who love thee and hearken to thy word in this perspicuous Cause.</p>

<p>O Javad! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of creation. He calleth thee as a token of His grace, and remembereth thee even as He remembered thee aforetime when thou wert in Iraq. Verily thy Lord loveth those who were with Him and remembereth them at eventide and at dawn. His mercy hath preceded the world and His grace hath encompassed all who are in the realm of possibilities. Blessed is he whom the veils of creation have not prevented from turning unto the Truth, and who hath, on the Day of God, turned toward the Dayspring whereby the horizons were illumined.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath been presented before the Throne. We have inhaled from it the fragrance of thy love for God, the Lord of all names, and found it purified from the mention of aught else and adorned with this Name through which the horizon of utterance hath been illumined and all who are in earth and heaven have been enlightened. We have heard that which thou didst call upon God with the ear of faithfulness, and have answered thee with this Tablet whereby the trees have yielded their fruits.</p>
<p>Remember when thou wert in the presence of the Throne and didst hear with thine own ear the call of God and didst drink the choice wine of reunion from the hands of the grace of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Verily thou wert mentioned before the Countenance and didst attain the favors of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. There hath befallen Us at the hands of the enemies that which no pen can recount nor any pages contain. God will soon seize those who have wronged you and will exalt your names among His servants. By My life! When the people awaken they shall weep over themselves for what they have wrought in this Day the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid thee in His service and to protect thee from those who have denied the proof of God and His testimony and have followed every contentious infidel. Convey My greetings unto thy brother. Verily We make mention of him as a token of grace that he may thank his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed is he for having turned unto God and for not having been prevented from the Path by the cawing of every idolatrous infidel. If thou shouldst see him who is the joy of the All-Merciful, convey unto him the greetings of the Prisoner and remind him of the verses of thy Lord, the Lord of all religions. Verily the glory rest upon thee and upon him and upon those who have attained unto the pure wine whose seal was broken by the finger of might.</p>

<p>O Husayn who hath attained! The Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! O Zaynu’d-Din! Verily thy Lord grieveth for His loved ones who were martyred in His path with a martyrdom the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, nor hath its equal been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. At times We make mention of them with supreme joy, for they have detached themselves from the world and attained unto the Most Exalted Companion. By the life of God! The Supreme Pen hath inscribed upon all things their remembrance, their praise, their steadfastness, their ascension, their firmness, their sublimity and their sovereignty. By God! The mentions of earth shall be effaced, but their mentions shall not be effaced from the tablets of the world. To this doth the Lord of Eternity bear witness in His mighty prison. O thou physician! We make mention of them at times with a grief that no records of existence can reckon. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful. The oppressors have wrought that which hath caused the dwellers of the kingdom of earth and heaven to lament, and there hath been sent down from the heaven of grace that which shall perpetuate the remembrance of those who gave up their spirits and all they possessed in the love of God, the Sovereign, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. At this moment We make mention of him who ascended unto the Most Sublime Horizon in that place - he who was named Safi in My Mighty Book, inasmuch as he believed when he attained the presence of the Countenance and acknowledged that which God had caused to be acknowledged on a day whereon the hearts of the learned and the mystics were troubled. To this doth thy Lord, the All-Informed, bear witness. This is a Tablet from Us unto him who hath turned unto the Countenance and attained unto this praiseworthy station. O Husayn! Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to recognize Him Who hath caused the Most Great Terror to appear through His mention, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Sovereign of earth and heaven, for having made me to turn unto Thee, to speak in Thy remembrance, and to acknowledge that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath uttered in the kingdom of Thine utterance. O my Lord! I am he who, by Thy leave, turned unto the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and entered the Ridvan when the Beloved of the world was lamenting for His loved ones and consoling His chosen ones and comforting His servants who circled round Him by night and by day. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, then make me steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Oppose not Him Who hath come with the signs of the Bayan and the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The heavens of religions have been cleft asunder by what the Judge hath brought forth on the Day of Reckoning through a command before which neither the hosts of the world nor the ranks of nations can stand.

Give thanks unto God for that My Most Exalted Pen hath turned toward thee and revealed for thee that which was a light unto all creation, a sun in the heaven of knowledge, a surging ocean amidst religions, and a Book speaking forth through this Name whereby the feet of the transgressors have slipped. Before My face have appeared the names of those whom thou didst mention in thy letter, and We have revealed for each one of them that whereby every receptive soul shall find the fragrance of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Give thanks unto God for that He hath sealed with thy mention this wondrous and glorious Book. When thou hast attained unto it and found the fragrance of thy Lord’s bounty, say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lands wherein Thy remembrance and Thy call were raised up, and by the seat whereon Thy throne was established, and by the fire of Thy Cause whereby the hearts of Thy chosen ones were set ablaze, and by the light of Thy countenance which shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty, to aid all who are on earth to turn unto Thee and return to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs. O Lord! Assist Thy loved ones to that which beseemeth Thy days and Thy Cause, which was announced by Him Who conversed with Thee, and was proclaimed by the Spirit, and was uttered by the Seal of Thy Prophets and the Prince of Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and established upon the throne of ’Do what Thou willest.’ There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

<p>O ’Abdu’llah Khan! The vain imaginings of men have seized them and deprived them from the shore of the Most Great Ocean. By the life of God! All the seas of the world cannot equal one drop thereof. From the earliest days until now, the Manifest Beauty hath arisen with such an arising that the hatred of the world and the rancor of nations, whether from divines or rulers, did not hold Him back. And when the lights of the Sun of Truth shed their radiance to some degree, the people of the Bayan emerged from behind the veil with drawn swords to assault the Countenance of the Divine Unity. They perpetrated that which no oppressor had ever committed. The verses have encompassed the world and the banner “Verily He is God” hath been raised before the faces of all peoples. Nevertheless, this hath profited not those who are lost in vain imaginings, even as a thousand two hundred years of worship, lamentations, anticipation and wailing in mosques and from pulpits profited not the Shi’ih sect, whether divines or followers. For had it profited them, they would not have pronounced judgment against and reviled the Lord of the world. Now too the people of the Bayan cling to the same vain imaginings. Where are the horsemen of the arena of inner meanings who may witness all the remembrances of the world and whatsoever is with the peoples as utter nothingness and pure non-existence, and who may turn, detached from all, with pure hearts, attentive ears and penetrating vision? This is a different day and a different Cause. By the life of God! All are heedless and veiled save whom thy Lord willeth. Beseech God that He may make the heedless souls aware and deprive them not of the lights of the Sun of Divine Unity. As for your intention to reach the Most Exalted Goal and Supreme Summit, it is not permitted in these days, for the polytheists and corrupters stand as barriers. We beseech the Exalted One to draw you nigh unto Him and honor you with His presence, or to inscribe for you from His Most Exalted Pen the reward of attaining the presence of His Countenance. Verily He is powerful over all things. Convey My greetings to the friends and summon them to the most great steadfastness on God’s behalf. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon every steadfast, firm one.</p>

<p>O Ali! We have desired to make mention of thee and those who have believed, on a Day which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. This is a Day whereon the atoms cry out: “The Revealer of verses hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Goal of them that know!” God took the covenant of this Day from all who are in the heavens and on earth, yet when He appeared in truth the people turned away, save those who shattered the idols of vain desire through the power of the Name of the Lord of all mankind and turned with radiant countenance toward the Supreme Horizon. How many learned ones lamented in separation, yet when the ocean of union surged they turned away and waxed proud before God, the Beloved of the sincere ones. Say: By God! The Hidden One hath appeared and hath spoken that which caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to be attracted. Blessed is he who hath recognized and found the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Praised One. O Ali! The Euphrates of thy Lord’s mercy hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen - take thou, in My Name, and drink therefrom through My firm and wise command. We give thee and those who have believed there glad tidings of a favor from Us and a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We further counsel you regarding that which hath been sent down in the Book from the presence of One mighty and powerful. Beware lest the conditions of the Pharaohs frighten you or the doubts of the oppressors who have adorned their heads with turbans and disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, sadden you. They reached the heights of glory in this vain life through My Name, yet when I manifested My Self they pronounced judgment against it with evident tyranny. O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! The Wronged One counseleth you from the precincts of the Prison to remain steadfast in this Cause, whose greatness hath been testified to by the tongues of the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise and whose sovereignty hath been witnessed by every truthful and discerning one. Hold fast unto it in the name of your Lord, the Lord of Names, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens, for having made known unto us the Dayspring of Thy Cause, the Source of Thy Revelation, and the Dawning-Place of Thy exalted Word, at Whose appearance the Dove cooed upon the branches.” This is a Day whereof God gave glad tidings aforetime - the Day whereon all people shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Thus hath the gate of inner meanings been unlocked by the Key of utterance, as the All-Merciful walked in the most exalted station and called all to His straight path.</p>

Blessed is the soul that at the time of its ascension soars on the wings of longing and yearning and makes for the Most Exalted Companion. The holy spirit, freed from the doubts and troubles of the world, possesses great power, its fragrance is penetrating and its might is manifest. Detachment in this station appears as the wing of divine confirmation and sets one in motion. O Ali, mention of this ocean is abundant and its pearls beyond reckoning. We beseech God to make manifest unto thee that which will cause the pavilion of His glory to be raised up. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Ever are the days of attainment remembered and the glances of grace directed to that quarter. O Ali, His mercy is manifest as the sun and His grace more exalted than the heavens; yet despite this, what the servants have said and continue to say! We beseech God to protect the people of unity from the people of division. In these days, the hypocrites in the cities and regions are again busy stirring up the people of unity. We beseech God to unite the people of unity, that all may speak with one tongue and soar with one wing, and that they may reflect upon the cause and reason for the abasement that hath encompassed them and seek deliverance from God. Verily He will deliver them through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

We make mention of the people of unity there and beseech God to assist them and adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness and justice and fairness, and to ordain for them the good of the hereafter and of this world.

<p>O Ali before Akbar! A strange world has appeared - that which should exist is absent, and that which should not exist is present. Truth is non-existent while falsehood and calumny are manifest. Each day the opposers of the Threshold attribute some theft and refer it to the poor, helpless inhabitants of Akka. Through tricks and schemes they seek to stain His sanctified hem, in order to erase the traces of truth and establish the traces of falsehood. You saw what Akhtar wrote, and the story about the Qur’an has surely reached your ears. Glory be to God! The realms of justice and fairness are darkened and clouded. Despite all this, and griefs the like of which have never appeared in the world, the Most Exalted Pen moves and the Tongue speaks. For the sake of protection and preservation, We sent some souls from this land to the Threshold with utmost love, as circumstances had appeared that would lead to corruption and bring about causes of murder. Therefore, out of mercy We did what you have heard. However, they joined the dawning-place of vain fancies, namely Shaykh Muhammad Yazdi, and he acted according to Yahya’s fatwa in ways whose mention would cause you grief. Outwardly, one would not have thought such souls existed in the world of being. You should abandon their mention and remember God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. God willing, you will be assisted in all conditions to aid and teach God’s Cause. A special Tablet of Visitation was revealed and sent for Bik, upon him be My glory and bounty, and likewise a Tablet was revealed and sent for one of his relatives. Some time ago, Aqa Siyyid Musa submitted a petition to the Most Holy Court. His answer was also revealed - deliver it to him. God willing, may the people of the world drink from the Kawthar of nearness and be illumined by the light of justice. In the nights and days the Most Exalted Pen is occupied with wise counsels and loving exhortations. We beseech God to create attentive ears. Verily He is powerful over all things.

Hearken unto the Call from the blessed Lote-Tree on high - verily it draws thee unto a station wherein thou shalt find thyself sanctified from the world and its concerns. Thy Lord is verily the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. This is the Day which God hath adorned with His mention in the Books of old, as doth testify the Mother Book in this exalted station. Beware lest thou be veiled by the veils of the divines or held back by the clamor of the theologians who have changed God’s bounty into denial and led their people into the fire. This is what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an, yet the people are in grievous doubt. They have denied Him Whom they mention night and day, and have pronounced judgment against Him without any clear proof from God, the Lord of all worlds. Observe then mention what the Shi’ih faction committed when God came with manifest sovereignty - they decked their heads with green and white, and committed what made the Faithful Spirit to groan. When thou hast attained unto God’s Tablet and His trace, and found the fragrance of the divine utterance from the Pen of the All-Merciful, say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation, the traces of Thy Pen, the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, the manifestations of Thy power, Thy most great signs, and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, to strengthen me in steadfastness in Thy Cause such that the affairs of the world and the doubts of the nations prevent me not from turning toward Thee, O Lord of eternity! O my Lord! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee, turning to the lights of Thy countenance, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and service to Thy loved ones. Then ordain for me, O my God, from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.” We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Baqir and give him glad tidings of that which the Most Exalted Pen of God hath turned toward him from the Most Glorious Horizon, that he may be among the joyous ones.

By God, wert thou to behold it with thine eyes, thou wouldst find it pierced by the spears of the polytheists and the arrows of the deniers. Every thread thereof crieth out between earth and heaven saying: “O peoples of earth and heaven! If ye desire to gaze upon your Best Beloved, the Most High, look upon me that ye may know what hath befallen Him at the hands of the hosts of Satan. Behold, O people, the blood that floweth from me - it is indeed the blood of God, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness.”</p>
<p>Were We to detail for thee what hath befallen Us, thou wouldst hear the lamentation of the Concourse on High and the cry of the angels drawn nigh. I am indeed the Youth heralded by the Primal Point and, before Him, by the Prophets and Messengers. Yet when I came from the heaven of command and rent asunder the veils, there arose the clamor of the perverse ones who broke God’s covenant and His testament, cast the Bayan behind their backs, and worshipped the calf instead of God. Woe unto them from the torment of a mighty day!</p>
<p>And thou, open thy tongue in My remembrance and praise among My handmaidens, that they may detach themselves from their own selves and desires and turn unto the King of kings and rulers. Verily thy Lord knoweth what hath befallen thee. Grieve not in His path, but place thy trust in Him. He will, in truth, protect thee from the harm of the corrupt ones. And the glory rest upon thee and upon those who have shown patience in hardship out of love for God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>O friends of God in Turbat! In My Name, the One manifest from the horizon of the invisible! God calls His loved ones there and reminds them of the verses of God, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful, that they may be assured of God’s grace and mercy and follow what hath been sent down from the presence of One knowing and wise. O My loved ones! Hold fast unto My commandments. By My life, they are the impregnable fortress for all nations and through them God protecteth you from the insinuations of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. We have ordained the laws and made them the Kawthar of life for whoso hath turned unto the All-Merciful. Drink ye therefrom in My Name, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Be ye as firm mountains in your Lord’s Cause and hold fast unto this strong cord. Verily it is more enduring than the heaven and whatsoever hath been created therein. Blessed is he who holdeth fast thereunto, and woe unto them that turn away. We counsel you to be trustworthy and truthful that God’s trustworthiness may be manifest in all else and that those in the heavens and earth may glorify Him. Be ye emblems of fidelity, the essence of creation, and dawning-places of virtuous character for all the world. Act ye according to what We have sent down in Our Most Holy Book. Verily it is more resplendent than the light of the sun, were ye of them that know. Beware lest anything prevent you from that which your Lord, the Mighty, the Great, hath desired. We have desired good for you in all worlds of Our worlds. Soon this world shall pass away and ye shall find yourselves in an exalted station. The Kingdom hath been created for your sakes and the Realm of Might calleth you unto this lofty seat. Give thanks unto God for having preferred you above most of creation and made you recognize the Dayspring of His Cause when every idolatrous transgressor turned away. They who have borne hardships in this path are among the choicest of creation - to this doth My truthful, faithful tongue bear witness. They who are heedless this day shall return unto God and lament for their deeds in this radiant, resplendent Day. Be ye so firm in the Cause that neither the malice of the malevolent nor the fabrications of the deniers shall frighten or deter you. He is with you under all conditions - He heareth and seeth. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Thus hath the sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of wisdom as a grace from Us, and I am verily the Ancient Bestower. Glory be upon you and upon those who have followed God’s command when it was sent down from His mighty, wondrous kingdom.</p>

We make mention of him who has turned towards God, and We remind him of what the Spirit casts upon Me of the verses of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Say: We have weighed all things with a word from Our presence, and verily it is the Balance amidst all created things, and through it We have completed the reckoning of creation. Verily thy Lord is swift to reckon. At every moment the Herald calls out, but none hear save those endowed with inner sight and hearing. O people of the earth!

He has come for your salvation and to purify your souls from that which veils you from God, the Revealer of verses. The eye was created for this Most Great Vision, and the ear for this Call which God has made the Kawthar of life for the people of Paradise and the Choice Sealed Wine for all created things. Glorified be the All-Merciful Who has granted this bounty which has encompassed all in the heavens and on earth. Say: Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of recognizing the Dawning-Place of Names, your ears from hearkening to this Most Sweet Call, and your eyes from My Most Exalted Horizon. Cast away what knowledge ye possess and turn unto God, your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. By God! We have sent the Messengers for this Day and created creation for the recognition of this Station which God has made the Dayspring of lights. Say: Today neither the world nor what it contains shall profit you. Leave it to its people and turn unto Him Who speaks with truth in this City wherein naught is heard from its precincts save the croaking of the raven. Say: The raven is he who turns away from the Truth and speaks according to his own desires. Thus have We detailed the matter in the Book. Were We to mention what hath befallen Us in this Prison, it could not be exhausted by pens, scrolls and tablets. Be thou not saddened by anything. Place thy trust in God, then make mention of Him amongst the servants. We have found the fragrance of thy love and have sent down for thee that which shall cause the mountains to soar. Take hold of the Book with the power of God, then thank Him for this bounty which equals not anything created in existence.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Upon thee be the Glory of God! Praise be to God that thou hast attained, both before and after, unto the verses of the Most Exalted Pen. The pen and the tongue are powerless to describe this station. The entire world was brought from nothingness into being specifically for the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, and was adorned with the ornament of existence. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined by the Sun of Revelation, all were found to be deprived save whom God willed.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty Message, for having made known to me Thy proof, for having aided me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon and the Dawning-Place of Thy attributes, O Thou Lord of Names, and for having preserved me on the path until I arrived at Thy Most Great Prison. Thy favors and gifts have encompassed me, such that Thou didst cause me to hear Thy most sweet call and didst show me the Dayspring of Thy Revelation, O Creator of the heavens. Through Thy grace and bounty I attained to that which the near ones attained, and through Thy loving-kindness and bestowals that which the sincere ones attained.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign over both the unseen and the visible, by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue the kingdom of names and didst guide the people of the realm of creation to the most exalted summit, to render me in all conditions empowered to serve Thy Cause. O my Lord! Do not deprive me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Ordain for me that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity, the ocean of Thy grace, and the sun of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I acknowledge Thy unity and Thy singleness, and that there is nothing like unto Thee. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, by the stations which Thou hast honored with Thy footsteps, and by the verses which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will, to make me in all conditions hold fast to Thy cord, cling to the hem of the robe of Thy grace, be detached from all else but Thee, and speak forth Thy praise. Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate. Thou doest what Thou pleasest by Thy power and ordainest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty.

The servant was gladdened by what shone forth and appeared from the horizon of your words and your utterances which were adorned with praise of God, the Lord of the worlds. When I read and became informed, I presented myself before the Face and submitted it. Then the tongue of the Beloved spoke and said: “O thou who gazeth upon the Cause and turneth toward the Countenance! We have heard what thou mentioned regarding the one who came to thee. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist him in His remembrance and praise and to confirm him in what He hath commanded in His Book. Verily He is the Giver, the Answerer, the Mighty, the Generous. And We have written for him that from which the sincere ones will find the fragrance of love and affection. To this doth every just and perceiving one testify. We send greetings upon the faces of the loved ones who act with goodness out of love for God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And We send greetings upon thee and upon thy family, female and male. And praise be to God, the Possessor of the unseen and the seen.” End.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath described Himself as the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is the Knower of all things. I was present before the Throne when the Ancient Beauty turned towards me and said, exalted be His grandeur and mighty His proof: “The Sacred House desired to turn towards God, the Lord of all worlds. We withheld the Pen from giving permission, but at this hour the sun of Will hath shone forth from the horizon of loving-kindness and We have permitted her, as a token of Our grace, for We are the Bountiful, the All-Wise. She may turn towards the Countenance of the Ancient Beauty accompanied by one of My Afnans. Thus hath the decree been sent down from Him Who possesseth the Preserved Tablet.”</p>
<p>“We command [al-Khalil] and My Afnan to consult regarding this matter. If they find it in accordance with what We have sent down of wisdom in the Book, they may proceed; otherwise, to wait is preferable. Thus hath the decree shone forth from the Supreme Horizon from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Since the decree of wisdom and consultation hath been recorded by the Pen of Command in God’s Book, therefore the True One Himself hath desired to act accordingly, that it may serve as a path for those who have believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. The Glory be upon him who heareth the Word and acteth according to what hath been commanded by God, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>What was heard from the Tongue of Grandeur is what has been recorded here. And He said that this year or next year, whenever wisdom requireth, they may proceed, for the Most Exalted Leaf - upon her be the Most Glorious Glory of God and His Most Resplendent Light - hath long made this request of the True One, hence permission hath been granted. However, all must be done in accordance with wisdom. The Command is in His hand and the decree revolves around the will of our Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.

He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable heights, in the summits of His loftiness, sanctified above the mention of all else save Him, and beyond the comprehension of aught else except Him. When He desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men, and to set the world in order, He revealed observances and created laws; among them He established the law of marriage, made it as a fortress for well-being and salvation, and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down from the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book. He saith, great is His glory: “Marry, O people, that from you may appear he who will remember Me amongst My servants; this is one of My commandments unto you; obey it as an assistance to yourselves.” And we pray for and grant peace upon the Utterance amongst the people of Baha who have expended their utmost effort to exalt this luminous Faith and were not deterred by the censure of the censurer.

I beseech Thee to make me among those whom the ranks of the oppressors have not prevented from turning to the lights of Thy justice, and whom the veils of the people of error have not hindered from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy grace and speaking Thy praise amongst Thy servants. I ask of Thee to assist me in that whereby my remembrance will endure throughout the duration of Thy dominion and Thy kingdom. By Thy glory! The fire of separation from Thee hath consumed me, and remoteness from the precincts of Thy nearness hath caused my death. My God, my God! Deprive me not of the ocean of Thy mercy nor the dawning splendors of the Sun of Thy oneness. Thou art He Who hath testified through Thy generosity to all created things, and through Thy bounty to all existence, both seen and unseen. I beseech Thee not to withhold Thy party from the Euphrates of Thy grace nor from the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy bestowal. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Forbearing.</p>

Turn with thy whole being to the Lord of all who turn to Him. By God! Thy faith profiteth Me not, nor doth the denial of them that have turned away harm Me. I summon thee purely for the sake of thy Lord, and He Himself sufficeth as a witness between Me and thee. Thou hast not yet grasped the root of the matter.

Cast aside all that thou hast heard, then look upon the verses themselves, that the sun of the beauty of thy Lord might shine forth upon thee from the horizon of His name, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Or reflect upon that which hath appeared in this Revelation and what others have wrought. By God! If thou wouldst be fair, thou wouldst say: “I believe in the Lord of all worlds.” Consider how the people of the Qur’an turned away from the All-Merciful and opposed Him Who called them at all times, that thou mayest perceive who remaineth today veiled by a mighty veil. That which is attributed to the Truth is indeed musk whose fragrance is diffused, yet none can detect it save those who turn to the All-Merciful with radiant countenance. I desire naught for Myself, but rather for God’s sake, were ye of them that know. And I desire naught save ascension unto Him, for He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And I love naught except what is with God, and I summon no one save to that which I am commanded by the Almighty, the Ancient of Days. In these days I am as one sitting beneath the sword, yet even in this state I summon the servants unto the Dayspring of the mercy of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Soon will the messenger of death come; then shall no one find escape. Seest thou any protector save God? Nay, by Him Who came with the truth with manifest sovereignty! Dost thou see any trace of former generations? Hear My counsel: forsake the world behind thee and turn to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. By His leave the breezes of grace pass by; turn to Him and deprive not thyself of them. Beware lest thou be among them that hesitate. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, and with Him is a preserving Book.

O my Lord! Thou seest me gazing toward the horizon of Thy bounty and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy of answering prayer. Then I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Crimson Scroll and the Ark which hath sailed in Thy name upon the sea of names, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou hast ordained for the near ones among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creatures. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, the Great.</p>

<p>The Wronged One calleth out to thee and giveth thee glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds, from this Spot which hath been named at one time the Most Exalted Horizon, at another the Heaven of heavens, and at still another the Most Great Prison and the Most Beautiful Names. He is, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O Ghani! The ocean of bounty hath turned toward thee and desireth to cast upon thee the pearls of wisdom and utterance, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of this noble station. Say: O peoples of the earth! Be fair in the Cause of God and His Manifestation, and be not of the wrongdoers. The verses have encompassed all directions and the Day-Star of proof hath shone forth from the horizon of the Pen of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Observe, then be fair, and be not of them who recognized God’s favor, then denied it and caused their people to dwell in the fire. Say: We have not entered schools, yet We have sent down from the heaven of knowledge and wisdom that before which all the learning of the earth hath bowed down, as every discerning one doth testify. Say: This is a Day wherein fancies and idle imaginings will profit you not. Fear God and be not of the ignorant. Cast away what ye possess of the divines and jurists of the earth, and take hold of the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him. He, verily, is the Commander, the All-Wise. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth as a grace from Us, and I am verily the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Be thou steadfast in the service of My Cause, gazing toward My horizon, turning unto My countenance, and speaking My beauteous praise. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Purpose and my Hope! I testify that this Day is Thy Day and this Manifestation Thy Manifestation. Thou hast appeared and revealed through Thy conquering power what lay hidden in the treasuries of inner meanings and concealed in the repositories of utterance, and Thou hast made manifest the Way and sent down the Proof. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and in Thy remembrance and praise amongst Thy creatures. O my Lord! I behold the reins of expression in the grasp of Thy power and the bridles of understanding in the right hand of Thy will. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Guardian over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>O Ahmad! Hearken unto the Call of God from the direction of the Divine Decree - verily there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise. Leave this land by Our command; thus have We sent down the decree from the heaven of Divine Justice and confirmed it in truth. Verily thy Lord is He Who ordaineth whatsoever He willeth. Grieve not over anything, but place thy trust in all thy affairs in God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou speak that which may cause harm to the Root of the Tree. Deal with the people, for they are weak and fail to comprehend subtle utterance, and they are in manifest obscurity. If thou findest one who is receptive, rend asunder his veils with wisdom and utterance. Thus doth thy Lord, the All-Merciful, command thee, and the decree hath come from the presence of One mighty and all-knowing.</p>
<p>When thou settest out, say: “O my Lord! I have left Thy vicinity by Thy leave. Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to do this and for having made me one of those who are content with what Thou hast decreed for them. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Be content with what God hath ordained for thee and be not grieved by those who have denied God and His signs. He is with thee under all conditions; verily He is the Protector of the sincere ones. Thine eyes have been gladdened by gazing upon the countenance of thy Lord. By God, thou hast attained to that which most of the servants have failed to attain, and thou hast heard the Call of thy Lord from the Dawning-Place of His mighty and impregnable utterance. Walk thou in His name, move by His love, and turn thy face toward the direction of His good-pleasure. Thus hath the command been sent down and the decree been fulfilled by thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Rejoice in what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen from thy Lord, the Lord of all names. This sufficeth thee above the dominion of the heavens and of the earth. When the Tablet of God and its trace reach thee, place thy right cheek upon the ground in humility and submission and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!”</p>
<p>Finally, beware lest thou speak that which may impel hearts to deny it, even though thou mayest have justification for it. Speak that which draweth hearts unto the direction of thy Lord. This is My counsel unto thee; make it the object of thy vision. Seize it and be thou of the thankful ones.</p>

<p>O My companion on the pages and My name in the Books! Hearken unto the Call of God from the shore of the Ancient Sea in the luminous spot from the Most Glorious Tree - verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful. God’s curse be upon him who hath wronged thee and denied thy rights in the Bayan. We testify that he is among the wrongdoers. Grieve thou not - God hath frustrated what they intended and hath sent down for thee that whereby thy mention shall endure amongst the worlds. Arise by My leave from the horizon of the heaven of My Cause and convey unto the people with wisdom and utterance. Thus hast thou been commanded by thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest those in the contingent world prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised. Consider the people of the Bayan and their lack of understanding. They have denied Him by Whose name the heaven of the Bayan was adorned with the sun of wisdom and exposition. But for Him the Tree of Sinai would not have spoken nor would the Dove of the Cause have warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Revelation. Thus hath the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s remembrance, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: O people! Were anyone to inhale, he would detect from every letter revealed in the Bayan the fragrance of My luminous garment. Say: This is He Whose covenant God took before His own covenant and before the creation of the heavens and earths. The winds of destiny have blown from the direction of might and power and deprived them of stability. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over what He willeth. After Our arrival in the Most Great Prison, We delivered God’s messages to the East and West of the earth that all might know that tribulations prevented not their Lord, the Most Glorious, from what He desired. And from the horizon of the Prison We summon the nations unto God, the Lord of eternity. Thus have We manifested power despite those who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Leave the heedless in their vain disputes, then remember thy Lord with spirit and fragrance. He is with thee and will aid thee with truth at all times. Make mention of the son on My behalf and give him glad tidings of My remembrance of him. Soon will God remove those who have wronged without clear proof or enlightening Book. And glory be upon thee and upon them from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

Verily, through the call of God are drawn the hearts of the pure ones, and were all who are in the heavens and earth to hear it, they would detach themselves from all things and turn toward the precincts of the Throne, the seat whereon thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, is established. Blessed is thy tongue for having been loosened in remembrance of thy Lord, and thy heart for having recognized thy Lord, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy. That which thou didst compose out of love for God, the Beloved of those who know Him, hath come before the Countenance, and unto it were directed the glances of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, then speak forth His remembrance and praise amongst His devoted handmaidens, that they may be drawn to the Dayspring of the Countenance, this hallowed and luminous horizon. Verily thy Lord is with thee under all conditions and will aid thee through utterance in remembrance of His Self, the Most Merciful. He, verily, is powerful over all things. Speak thou! Remember thou! Be thou devoted! This is better for thee than all the treasures of earth. Thus doth thy Lord testify with a wondrous tongue of truth. Turn thy face toward the precincts of the Throne and say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Master and my Beloved, for having caused me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Most Exalted Self in this latter resurrection, and for having enabled me to voice His praise between earth and heaven. I beseech Thee then, by Thy Beauty through which were gladdened the eyes of the denizens of the most exalted Paradise, not to deprive me of what lieth with Thee of Thy great gifts and mighty favors. Thou, verily, art powerful to do what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus doth command thee the Beloved One Who is imprisoned in the land of exile through what the hands of the iniquitous have wrought. Convey from Us Our greetings upon the countenance of thy father and mother, and upon those handmaidens who have believed in God, the True King, the Manifest Justice. The Spirit be upon thee, then the Glory be upon thee, then the Light be upon thee from the presence of One mighty and beauteous.

Give thanks to your Lord for having aided you to recognize His Self and for causing you to hear His call in these days wherein the hearts of the mystics are bewildered. Were the veil to be lifted, you would soar with longing in this sanctified and luminous atmosphere. Preserve the elixir of your Lord’s love within your heart, lest Our faithless servants discover it. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be to Thee for having made my heart a treasury of Thy love and for having deposited therein that which Thou hast denied to most of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Symbol were revealed, and through which the sun of what was and what shall be shone forth from the horizon of Thy Will, to send down upon me at all times that which will draw me nigh unto the court of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, that I may detach myself from all created things, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of possibility! O Lord! Deprive not this fish from immersion in the sea of Thy oneness, nor this leaf from the Lote-Tree of Thy singleness, nor this bird from soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and good-pleasure. O Lord! Thou art He Who, through a word from Thy presence, distinguished between all created things and through it attracted the hearts of those immersed in the depths of names and attributes. Thou hast ever been the Sustainer of all created things and exalted above all who dwell on earth and in the heavens. I beseech Thee to render me purified from all allusions, detached from all else save Thee, and turning toward the Kaaba of Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! Clothe me with the robe of forgiveness and purify me from whatsoever prevents me from turning to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of grace and bounty! There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Powerful. Remember on Our part him who was named Nabil before Mahdi, that he may rejoice within himself and be among the steadfast.

Cast behind thee every mention and hold fast to the remembrance of the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Purify thy heart from all allusions, then make it a receptacle for the love of My Name, the All-Merciful, and be not of the heedless. Guard thyself lest the whisperings of Satan change thee. Seek aid in the remembrance of God, thy Lord, then draw strength from His power and sovereignty, and hold fast to His strong cord.

Verily, he who hath drunk from the Most Great Ocean is indeed a light to the world amidst all peoples. Thus hath the Lord of Eternity testified in the Scriptures and Tablets. And if his light be veiled, this is due to the veiling of the people. God will soon reveal it through a sovereignty from Him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.</p>

Thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, beareth witness to this. Fear thou nothing. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Revealer of verses. He protecteth whomsoever He willeth through His command, even as He protected Me when I was in the hands of the wicked. He aideth whomsoever He pleaseth through the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and supporteth whosoever turneth unto Him when He appeared with the sovereignty of grandeur and power.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having attained the Most Great Victory when the Lord of all beings came with standards and ensigns unfurled. Thou hast a station among stations with thy Lord.

Remember Him by night and by day, and stand firm in the Cause in such wise that the hearts of the evil ones who broke God’s covenant and His testament and turned back on their heels, following vain imaginings and idle fancies, may be shaken thereby.</p>
<p>Though thou didst not attain the presence before the Throne, We have ordained for thee the reward of one who attained His presence on the day which God made the Lord of all days. The Command is in His hand - He giveth to whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth, and He shall not be asked of His doings. He is indeed the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing.

O Abdullah, consider the words of Ansari who said: “My God, if Thou shouldst but once address someone as ‘My servant,’ his laughter would transcend the Throne.” And now, manifestly and evidently, the King of Creation has addressed thee from the realm of oneness by this name. Through the grace of the All-Merciful, thou must become so intoxicated and attracted by the choice wine of the utterances of the Lord of all possibility that the heat of thy love may influence the hearts of men. God willing, mayest thou discover the sweetness of this blessed word as befitteth it, that its delight may endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Today every soul is commanded to invite the people of the contingent world to the Truth through wisdom and utterance, and to arise with supreme steadfastness in the Cause of the Lord of Names - an arising that no sitting down shall overtake and no cawing of the polytheists shall disturb. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause that whosoever today speaks in remembrance and praise of the Truth among the people is recorded among those who have arisen, even if he be resting upon his couch. O Abdullah! The satans are observed lying in ambush - that is, souls who count themselves among the people of the Bayan are secretly and openly engaged in leading the people astray. Say: O people! Guard yourselves and shun these ones, and when any of them appears among you, be as fire in the Cause of your Lord, the Chosen One. By My life! The Bayan is innocent of them, as attested by what hath been sent down in the Tablets of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Great. They make mention of the Bayan while killing those who connect the Bayan with a word from His presence. Woe unto them and unto those who follow them! Leave them to themselves and turn to God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee that which hath spread the fragrance of thy Lord’s garment, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus doth the Supreme Pen make mention of thee in this Tablet, with which nothing that hath been created in the heavens and earth can compare.

Be thou enkindled with the fire of the love of God, that all differences may be removed and pure hearts may unite in proclaiming the Cause of the Lord of all created things, drinking the sealed wine in celebration of the Name of the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The essence of the Cause hath been and shall ever be the good-pleasure of God. Should someone manifest all virtuous and praiseworthy deeds, yet God be not pleased with him, it hath yielded and shall yield no fruit whatsoever. And the good-pleasure of God is manifested through the Manifestation of His Cause, for He in His Essence hath never been and shall never be seen. The Dawning-Place, the Manifestation and the Day-Spring of that invisible Sun hath been and shall ever be the Temple of Unity, and His Will and Purpose appear and shine forth from Him. Therefore must all today fix their gaze upon the Dawning-Place of the Cause alone and strive to lead people to the enduring Law.</p>
<p>O Ali! From the beginning of the Cause thy services have been mentioned and known before the Divine Throne, and the breezes of the All-Merciful, in the form of Tablets, have descended upon thee each year. However, this spiritual outpouring was suspended for a time due to certain unpleasing events. Thou must arise to serve the Cause in such wise as shall be acceptable in the presence of God. O Ali! Hold fast to My good-pleasure, heedless of aught else. By God! This is My beloved command, and this is what shall profit thee in this world and the next, if thou be of them that hearken and act.</p>
<p>Had the loved ones until now acted according to what streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen, assuredly most of the servants would now be turning toward the Lord of creation.

<p>O friends of God! In the name of the All-Knowing Expositor! The ocean of meanings from the fountain of the Pen of the All-Merciful is ever-flowing and surging. We beseech God not to withhold it from the thirsty ones nor deprive the seekers thereof. O friends! In truth I say, this Day has no peer or likeness, for the ocean of bounty is surging and the Sun of generosity is shining resplendent. Strive that perchance ye may attain unto that which shall cause the perpetuation of your existence. Consider how many divines, learned ones, princes, rich and poor were awaiting the Day of God, lamenting and bewailing night and day, yet when the Most Great Luminary appeared from the horizon of the will of the Ancient King, all remained veiled save whom God willed. Give thanks unto the one true God that He aided you and guided you to the highest horizon, and that in these numbered years He hath, through His grace, mentioned and continues to mention you in the Most Great Prison. Although the worth of this bounty is not known today due to mankind’s lack of capacity, yet ere long God, exalted be His glory, will make manifest this station. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things. Beseech ye God for steadfastness, for the cawing of the raven shall be raised from every horizon, as We have forewarned in previous Tablets. Likewise seek ye divine confirmation that ye may act according to what hath been commanded. Before the dawning of the Sun of Laws no one was under obligation, but after its appearance all were and shall continue to be bound thereby, that all may attain unto His infinite divine bounties and drink from the Kawthar of His mercy. Ye must all observe wisdom, lest that which might cause disturbance to weak souls should occur. We counsel you for the sake of God - to this testifieth the Tongue of Revelation in this Most Great Prison, and beyond it the tongues of the Concourse on High. Blessed is he who remembereth the verses of his Lord - he is assuredly among those who are nigh unto God in a perspicuous Book.</p>

<p>O Ali Asghar who hath attained the presence and gained the bounty, of Milan, He is the Mighty, the Chosen One</p>
<p>Great is the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and all-encompassing is His bounty. Today thou art mentioned before the Lord of mankind on this most excellent of days, and art recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Today the eye proclaims with the most exalted call: “I swear by the Sun of Truth, I have never seen the like of this Day!” Likewise the ear proclaims with the most exalted call: “None hath ever heard the like of this Call which is raised morn and eve from the most exalted horizon!” The loved ones of God - they who have transcended earth and heaven - must arise with perfect steadfastness to promote the Cause and hold fast to that which will ensure the preservation of the Word and the exaltation of being. O Ali-Qabli-Asghar! Praise be to the Goal of the world and the Sovereign of nations Who hath enabled thee to attain that whereof the peoples of the world are deprived, save whom God willeth. At this moment thy portrait was presented before the Face of the Wronged One and attained that which surpasseth all reckoning. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Spirit of the world and Light resplendent and shining amidst the nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name through which the cities of Thy knowledge and wisdom were illumined, to number me among those whom Thou hast mentioned in Thy mighty Book - of whom Thou didst say, and Thy word is the truth: “On them shall be no fear, neither shall they grieve.” O my Lord! Aid me to shatter the idols of vain imaginings and to rend asunder the veils of such as have turned away from the Sacred Spot and the Station. Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names, by Thy Command which hath encompassed earth and heaven, to grant me success in all conditions. I testify, O my God, to Thy grace and bounty and generosity and favors, that Thou hast called me to the horizon of Thy Revelation and the ocean of Thy verses and the Dayspring of Thy inspiration and the Source of Thy laws, and hast enabled me to arise before the gate of Thy grandeur and to hearken unto Thy call and to behold Thy signs. O Lord! Illumine me with the lights of Thy knowledge, then cause me in all conditions to turn toward Thee and to hold fast to Thy cord. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Herald! The Herald of the Cloud of the Divine Throne, adorned in the robe of sublime glory of the realm of oneness, hath journeyed from the unseen realm of eternal survival in the City of Faithfulness toward the Egypt of the divine beauty in the Sinai of love. Through its fragrance, the divine perfumes and holy celestial scents have perfumed and adorned the atmosphere of sacred divine existence. It seems the heavenly Kawthar of the All-Merciful and the pure water of the absolute Paradise have been perfumed by this enchanting fragrance. Crystal goblets are in the hand of the Cupbearer of eternity and ruby cups in the hand of the Virgin Countenance, while from every direction they seek crimson wine and incomparable, sweet, pure water - to see who shall receive a portion and who shall gain a share, that He may illumine with this radiant garment the divine eye of insight which is reflected therein, and with this hidden wine of oneness may He quench the heart’s thirst, that without mentioning names it may mention names, and without describing attributes it may describe attributes. Glory be to God for the wondrous comprehensive divine wisdom and the radiant all-encompassing power of the realm of oneness, whereby all created things are bewildered by a single letter thereof and all contingent things are intoxicated and senseless from its melody. Indeed, this wine of the eternal morn requireth a vessel of light, and this pure honey of the everlasting dawn needeth a cup of crystal camphor, that the apple of the eye of the holy temples and beauty may drink of this incomparable water of life and thereafter become the cupbearer at the divine banquet and the lordly gathering. In these days when the birds of the realm of existence have gathered and formed ranks in the heaven of manifestation, the hoopoe of divine attraction hath taken flight from the atmosphere of mighty power and turned from the eternal East to the everlasting West, that it may hear what it will from the holy Beauty and the intimate Countenance in the City of Divine Identity and Love, and what tidings it may bring. Clothe and honor with the radiant silk robe of glorification whomsoever thou pleasest. And the Spirit be upon you all.</p>

<p>O Javad son of Zaman! In the name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Glorious! These are the verses of holiness which have been sent down in truth and verily they are the Revelation of God among the worlds. God hath made them the source of His knowledge and the treasury of His Revelation and the dayspring of His recognition between the heavens and the earths. Verily they are the proof of God unto all who are in the kingdom of Command and creation. Through them He giveth and withholdeth and sendeth down mercy upon all created things. And thou, give thanks unto God that thy name hath flowed from a holy and luminous Pen. Then be thou steadfast in the Cause, for most of the people of the Bayan have turned away from Him in Whom they had believed, and have worshipped the idols of their desires, and were of those who worship idols. Sanctify thyself from these who have disbelieved after having believed and have turned away. Say: This is ’Ali in truth Who hath appeared with the sovereignty of the Cause and manifest tokens of might. Then take refuge in the fortress of power in this impregnable stronghold. Say: O people! Dispute not concerning the verses of God and reject not the truth by what ye possess and be not of the ignorant. Say: This verily is the sanctuary of God amongst you. Deprive not yourselves thereof. God hath caused suns to shine forth from its right-hand corner which circle round about it and are of those who circle round. O people! This is the Book of God among you wherein hath been inscribed by the finger of might the knowledge of the former and the latter generations. Take it with power from Us, then read what hath been sent down therein, then ponder what hath been treasured in the repositories of its words of the pearls of knowledge and wisdom that ye may discover that which none besides you hath discovered and be of those who are endued with insight. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then consort with people with wisdom lest harm befall thee and the fire of thy heart be quenched. Thus do We command thee. Act according to what thou hast been commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Be thou at peace within thyself. God hath ordained for thee abundant good. Verily He is the Powerful over what He willeth and verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. And the Glory be upon thee and upon every assured and perceiving one.</p>

<p>O Rafi’-i-Badi’, upon whom be the Glory of God! God, the Exalted One, declares: The dawn of meanings has risen and the horizon of knowledge is resplendent and brilliant with the rays of the Sun of utterance. At all times one must remind the people of the realm of possibility through the essence of utterance. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of grace that the drops of the ocean of utterance are more beneficial to the people of the earth than the effulgences of the sun and the spring rains. However, some utterances have caused and continue to cause the extinction of the fire of divine love, as has been heard and continues to be heard from some who have claimed knowledge and unity. We beseech God to cause people to attain unto hearing ears that they may distinguish the utterances of the Sun of Truth from all else and attain their purpose. O Rafi’! God willing, may you be aided through divine bounties to utter words that will cause the enkindling of receptive souls and accepting hearts. God willing, may the Almighty and Exalted One grant unto those who expound a motherly nature and fatherly compassion, that the children of time may be educated and attain unto hearing and sight. You must arise, through God’s might and power, to serve the Cause with perfect steadfastness, for the cawing of the ravens and the clamor of the deluded ones have been and continue to be raised from every direction, as was revealed aforetime in the Tablets from the heaven of divine Will. Verily thy Lord is He Who overshadoweth all who are in earth and heaven, and He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before the Throne, for He hath turned toward thee from this Spot and maketh mention of thee through that which is the spirit of life unto the body of creation. Thy Lord is verily the Clear One, the Generous. We have heard how thou hast praised the Wronged One in various writings. He is verily the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We make mention of thee and respond to thee with that which shall cause thy mention to endure in the Kingdom of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath heard and responded, then stood firm in this momentous, mighty Cause.</p>

This is that station which was mentioned and recorded in previous Books. The call of the Spirit was raised from this spot and all the Prophets of God gave glad tidings of its appearance. This divine hill, from the day it was created until these days, has been awaiting the cup of meeting. Praise be to God that it attained thereunto. In various stations the call was raised, the fragrance of remembrance diffused, and the light of the countenance shone forth resplendent - all that was recorded in the divine Books of old. Well is it with them that understand, and woe to the heedless! O ’Abdu’l-Muhammad, praise the Goal of all worlds Who aided thee and caused thee to attain His special favors. We have heard thy mention and praise, and witnessed thy turning and devotion to the love of God and service to His Cause. We make mention of thee in this clear Book. This is a Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of My tender mercy - be thou thankful to God for this great bounty. We send greetings to the friends in that land and command them to that which befitteth the days of God, that all may be adorned with the glory of honor and arise to serve the Cause with utmost wisdom. The whole world awaited to attain unto this Most Great Revelation and be enabled to hearken unto but one word of His utterances. Yet none attained this most exalted station save whom God willed. Be grateful to thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. He hath aided thee and caused thee to attain unto that which is the goal in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of him whom We named the Sublime, the Wondrous, in My exalted Book. We have mentioned him in various Tablets with such mention as causeth the sincere ones to inhale the fragrance of eternity - a favor from Our presence, and I am verily the Powerful over what I will. The glory shining from the horizon of My tender mercy be upon you and upon those who have turned to God on this Day wherein trembling hath seized the inhabitants of all regions, save those whom God hath protected, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>O He! Since thou hast heard the sweet Hijazi melodies from the Iraqi Countenance, now hearken to the spiritual Shahnaz strains from the divine Falcon, that thou mayest perceive novel songs of faithfulness from the eternal lute and harp, and hear the melody of the divine pipe from the strike of the divine Unity, and step into the lane of the Beloved with all thy heart and soul, until thou becomest all spirit and fliest without wings, and art intoxicated without wine, and speakest eloquently without tongue, and attainest the stations of attraction, longing, ecstasy and taste, until thou forgettest sorrow and drinkest from the ocean of joy.</p>
<p>God said to Moses from the decree of the heart:</p>
<p>“O chosen one, I love thee!”</p>
<p>But effort is needed until thou emigratest from the realm of self and desire and soarest to the sacred precincts of holiness and becomest intimate with the sanctuary of the soul and findest the way to the heart of the Friend. How sweet is this utterance and how excellent must be the deed! If thou hearkenest to the counsel of the Friend and journeyest in the paths of His good-pleasure - keep far from thyself and draw near to thy Lord; cast away what thy self desireth and seek what thy Lord willeth; forget all else and remember His light. Drink from the wine of love and close thine eyes to the world, for whatever thou seest will perish and pass away in an instant, while that which is with God remaineth and perisheth not, and endureth and fadeth not away. Know the value of these days, for union is not always possible. The nightingale singeth only in spring and crieth not until it seeth the rose. The time cometh when the divine nightingale ceaseth from mentioning meanings and taketh flight to the spiritual branch and settleth in the divine invisible rose gardens.</p>
<p>Hearken with the ear of the soul and accept with all thy heart. Though it was delivered in Persian melody, yet the Hijazi strain is concealed within it and divine mysteries are treasured therein. And the light be upon thee and upon those who are with thee.</p>

Praise be to God, thou didst inhale the fragrance of the Divine raiment, and it guided thee unto the dawning-place of the Hidden Secret, and the dayspring of the Well-guarded Treasure: wherefore at length, on the wings of yearning and devotion, of rapture and attraction, thou didst set out to reach the Most Exalted Destination, traversing prairies, deserts, seas and mountains, until thou didst attain the Furthermost Bourne, and the Spot around which the Concourse on High circle in adoration. No station equalleth this station: thereto have testified the Books of God aforetime and hereafter, and withal this perspicuous and mighty Tablet.

I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity that this utterance, which hath risen above the dayspring of the Pen of the All-Merciful, shall never be blotted out from the pages of the world. Do thou recognize its station, and be of the thankful. Please God, those souls who have fixed their gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon, and laid fast hold upon the hem of the mercy of the Incomparable Friend, should, in teaching the Divine Cause, do so both with wisdom and with utterance. All matters today are dependent upon wisdom. Should wisdom not dictate it, it is not permitted to speak. All must cleave unto such matters as are conducive to the assurance and tranquillity of the people, for by reason of the clamour of the heedless the hearts of the weak are like to be sore shaken. Thy Lord, verily, is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the one who aideth his Lord with goodly deeds and a spiritual character; he, truly, is reckoned among the people of Baha’ in the Crimson Book, wherein the Pen of the Most High hath inscribed the secrets of all that hath been and shall be. Wondrous and incomparable Verses have been sent down especially for thee. Please God, thou mayest attain unto them all, and, with perfect wisdom and eloquence, engage in service to the Cause - service such as will be permanent and lasting, to the degree that the evanescence of the world and all its vicissitudes shall never change it. Teaching is the Divine command, provided it be undertaken with wisdom. He, verily, speaketh the truth; leadeth the way; and revealeth the proof.

<p>O Mulla Muhammad Husayn! In the name of the One All-Knowing God, at all times the Supreme Pen summons the people of the world of possibility to the Dawning-Place of the revelation of the All-Merciful. Yet most of mankind remain veiled and deprived therefrom, even though they witness and know with certainty that whatever is visible will perish and decline shall overtake it. Some people are occupied with vain imaginings and are seen to be far from the Dawning-Place of certitude, while others are deluded by outward bounties and are thereby deprived of the Dawning-Place of divine revelation and the Source of the sublime Command. God shall soon purify the earth of these people and their deeds and actions and words and pride and vainglory. Verily He is the Just Rewarder, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We convey greetings to all the friends in that land and command all to show forth the utmost steadfastness, for the deniers and objectors and hosts of negation exist both within and without. We beseech God to protect them all. In most Tablets mention hath been made and continues to be made of steadfastness. Nevertheless it was observed that a certain soul was deprived of the Euphrates of divine favors by a drop of bitter salt. Such is the condition of souls. In all divine Books mention hath been made of this Day and it hath been named the Day of God. Yet people remain occupied with the vain imaginings of the past and are far removed from the Purpose. Fie upon them! They have no share in this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day.</p>
<p>With the utmost earnestness and endeavor you must summon the people to this exalted and most sublime station and this most glorious Spot. The beginning of the matter is to believe in God and its end is to remain steadfast in His Cause. The glory of God rest upon you and upon My loved ones who have heard My call and recognized My path and acted according to what was commanded in My Book and attained unto the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of My bounty. These are the people of My Kingdom, upon whom the Manifestations of My Cause and the Dawning-Places of My wondrous utterance shower their blessings. From this station We send greetings to your wife who has turned to God and attained unto His days and believed while all on earth turned away, save those whom God desired, the Single One, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds! Every year the fragrances of the eternal Garment have wafted over thee from the direction of divine unity, and verses of God have been specifically revealed and sent down. Consider this universal bounty as great and count it as a precious opportunity. God willing, mayest thou be ever successful in a manner befitting this station. The infinite favors of God have encompassed all created things, and their manifestations are dependent upon their effort and endeavor. We beseech God that He may cause the hidden fruits within the divine trees of human souls to appear in the world of kingdom through the blowing of the winds of mercy and the outpourings of the cloud of infinite bounties. Verily, He is powerful over all things. May all ever dwell in the paradise of the love of the All-Merciful and be sustained by the endless divine bounties. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Generous. The ultimate goal and the highest of all ordained stations in the kingdom of creation has been the recognition of the Ancient Beauty and the Most Great Name. Whosoever truly attaineth unto this most exalted station and most glorious horizon, the hidden mysterious manifestations and the veiled maidens of inner meanings from every direction without direction and from every station without veils will be unveiled and revealed unto him. And he will become so immersed in the manifestations of the lights that are neither of the East nor of the West that the world and whatsoever hath been ordained therein of the manifestations of beauty and the signs of glory and adorned things and diverse bounties will not prevent him from the eternal bounties which is the station of recognition of the Primal Point. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto this station and hath drunk from this chalice. Forget not what We have bestowed upon thee and shown thee. Be grateful and abide in manifest joy. In these days the prison-land is greatly disturbed and in turmoil, such that the friends are dwelling in a new prison, and tribulations are present from every direction. However, through divine grace and infinite mercy, there hath been and is no sorrow. All that cometh to pass in His path is indeed a mercy unto those who are nigh and a glory unto the sincere ones. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>God makes mention of His servant that he may find joy in His remembrance. O Karim! Hearken unto the call of this Prisoner. He verily heard thy cry at the time when thou didst respond to His Cause, and He is, in truth, the All-Knowing. Know thou that God hath accepted thy turning unto Him and hath inscribed thy name upon a Tablet that was, in truth, magnificent - among those who attained the presence of His Countenance, and heard His call, and were blessed with His meeting, and were honored thereby, and were illumined by the lights of His resplendent face. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this most exalted station and this most glorious state. He, verily, is merciful towards His servants.</p>

Guard thou My affairs and be not impatient regarding them. Thus doth the Pen of Glory command thee from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. There hath been ordained for thee in the All-Glorious Paradise a noble station.</p>
<p>Make mention of Me in My land, that I may make mention of thee in My heaven. Then hold fast unto the cord of My bounties, for it will lead thee to a station of sublime glory. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to recognize Him and for having made His Self known unto thee, after every remote polytheist had opposed Him. Be thou steadfast in My love, then be thou enkindled with this Fire through which the heart of every insightful mystic hath been set ablaze.</p>
<p>How wonderful is this bounty which hath appeared in truth and encompassed both small and great! Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves thereof, and deny not Him to Whose sovereignty and grandeur the denizens of the all-highest Paradise and the realities of all things bear witness. Tarry not upon the path - pass ye beyond it, and be not tyrannous transgressors. Say: Have mercy upon yourselves and oppose not Him - for whoso opposeth Him is cursed by the inhabitants of Paradise and by those who bear the Throne of thy Lord with manifest power.</p>

Say: This indeed is the Youth of God among you Who calleth you unto Him and reciteth unto you verses which were sent down in truth with the truth, and Who awaiteth at every moment what hath been ordained for Him in the tablets of decree, if ye be aware of this.

<p>O Mustafa! Upon thee be the Most Glorious Glory of God. The Most Great Branch hath made mention of thee in this Most Holy, Most Luminous Station. We make mention of thee through that which God hath made as the Kawthar of Life for the followers of all religions. Blessed is he who hath turned and attained, and woe unto the heedless. This is a Day wherein the fragrance of revelation and inspiration hath been wafted amongst mankind, and all things have proclaimed: The Kingdom and Dominion belong unto God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Arise in My Name to serve My Cause, and remind the servants of this Momentous News wherewith the Books of God, both past and future, have given glad-tidings. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire and taken hold of that which he was bidden in this perspicuous Tablet. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of the Prison, then aid Him through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. He will verily assist thee and exalt thee through His firm and mighty Command.</p>
<p>Say: He hath appeared with truth with such steadfastness as the might of the servants could not frighten Him, nor could the clamor of the heedless deter Him. Say: O peoples of the earth! Judge fairly concerning that which hath appeared with truth, and be not of the oppressors. This is a Day wherein the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath been raised. They who have heard it, these are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, the mention of which God hath revealed in the Book of Names. He is verily the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His mighty and wondrous Command.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Tongue of Ancient Days spoken, when He was in the Most Great Prison, as a mercy from His presence upon thee. He verily desireth whomsoever hath desired Him, and loveth whomsoever hath loved Him. To this doth the Mother Book bear witness in this glorious and exalted Station.

O servant! Give thanks to thy Lord for having aided thee to turn towards His Self that dominates the worlds. By My life! Whosoever has today attained the lights of the Face, the denizens of the Supreme Concourse make mention of him, and towards him turn the faces of those through whom the clouds pour down rain, the winds blow, and the earth brings forth its vegetation. This is the certain truth. Arise to serve the Cause by the command of thy Lord, then make mention of Him amongst the servants, that perchance those servants who are heedless today of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, may arise to praise Him. Blessed is he who has drawn near with an illumined heart to the Most Great Scene and has held fast to the Most Great Cord which God has made a sign of His favor amidst the nations. And woe to him who has turned away from this glorious Scene. O people! Obey Him Who calls you to God and follow not those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. At all times and under all conditions We have called all to the Mighty, the Powerful One. Once We were in chains, and We called the tribes to God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. And once We were among the captives in God’s path, the Lord of Names, and We called the people of creation to that which is better for them than the kingdom of the heavens and earth. And now in the Most Great Prison We call the nations, but the people are in grievous stupor. Among them is he who heard the call, cast aside what he possessed, turned towards Us and said: “Here am I, O Beloved of the worlds!” And among them is he who heard and turned away - he is assuredly among the perishing ones. And among them is he who heard not his Lord’s call - We found him among the dead. Blessed is he who heard and turned towards and answered his Ancient Lord. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thy heart may rejoice thereby and the eyes of the mystics be consoled. Take the Tablet of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, with assurance, then place it upon thine eyes. Say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds!</p>

This is a Day wherein all things were stirred by the breeze of God and the unitarians soared in an atmosphere that was luminous with the adorning of the Command.

I testify that Thou hast ever been powerful over all things.” They who have hesitated this Day have followed vain imaginings and were far removed from the precincts of nearness. Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the veils and cast away what is with the people, turning unto a horizon that was illumined with the lights of the Throne. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We behold the divines busying their pens after the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised between earth and heaven, and they speak of idle fancies when the Sun of the Self-Subsisting hath dawned from the dayspring of a Name that was, in truth, exalted. God shall soon erase their traces and establish what He willeth. He hath ever been wise over all things. They who have fulfilled the Covenant of God and His Testament - God shall soon exalt them through a sovereignty from His presence. He hath ever encompassed all things. We have sacrificed Our souls in the path of God and summon all from the horizon of tribulation unto God, the Possessor of Names. Blessed is the soul that hath advanced and the countenance that hath turned - he is of the people of Baha in a Tablet that was sealed with the seal of glory. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to ordain for thee the good of this world and the next. He hath ever been watchful over His servants.

I desired not to manifest Myself, but the Mighty, the Faithful manifested Me. I concealed My face; your Ancient Lord revealed it. Look not unto what ye possess, but look unto the proof of God and His balance, then unto His sovereignty which hath encompassed the worlds. Verily, he who looketh unto what he possesseth is reckoned among the people of delusion before your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Every learned and informed one beareth witness unto this. O people! Break not the Covenant of God and His pledge, and follow not the idolaters. Turn ye unto the lights of this Countenance which hath dawned from this luminous horizon. Nothing shall profit you this Day save what God hath desired for you, if ye be of them that are assured. O thou servant who hast turned unto God! Hearken unto the call from this wronged, exiled One. There is no God but Him, the Single, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Despair not of the spirit of God and His mercy. Be thou steadfast in this straight Path, then recite unto the servants what We have caused thee to hear of the cooing of the Dove upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree, that they may arise and turn unto God, the Goal of those who know. Blessed is he who hath opened his lips in praise of his Lord in these days wherein all things have proclaimed that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>

<p>Glorified be He before Whom all in the heavens and earth bow down in worship - among them are those who have recognized Him and prostrate themselves before His luminous, holy, and resplendent countenance, and among them are those who worship Him yet know Him not and remain among the heedless. Say: O people, this is a servant of God among you who was lying upon his couch when the breezes of your Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Beautiful, awakened him and raised him up to His Cause, causing him to speak forth in praise of His Self among the worlds. He commands you to that which God, your Beloved and the Beloved of those who know, has commanded, and forbids you that which you were forbidden in God’s ancient and revealed Book. Say: He has sacrificed his spirit in His path and conveyed that which he was commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The multitude of enemies did not deter him after they all rose up against him and sought to shed his blood without any proof or clear Book. He spoke at all times what the Spirit commanded him, to which every fair-minded and informed one bears witness. He now stands before the hands of enemies, awaiting what has been ordained for him in the preserved Tablets of glory. Say: He has commanded you only to that which would purify your souls from the turbidities of self and passion, yet you heeded not his word and followed the ways of the corrupt. In all the Tablets He forbade you to shed blood, yet you committed that which violated His sanctity before all creation. Fear God, O people, and spread not corruption in the land after its reformation, and cast not the ways of God behind your backs, and be not of those who forsake them. Act according to what you were commanded in all the Tablets, then abandon what you were forbidden - this is better for you, were you of those who perceive. O servant! Rejoice within yourself at what has been mentioned in this Tablet and be of those who are gladdened. We beseech God to assist you in His Cause and those who have turned to His shining and luminous countenance. And the Spirit be upon you and upon those who have heeded God’s counsel and were among the detached ones. And praise be to God, the Beloved of those who know.</p>

I beseech Thee by the Word of Thy command, whereby Thou didst create all contingent beings and bring forth all existing things, and whereby Thou didst raise up the Manifestations of Thy oneness and the Daysprings of Thy divinity. Then by Thy Name through which Thou didst test all names, and whereby all who are in earth and heaven were dismayed, save those who took the chalice of Baha through Thy sovereignty and power, and drank therefrom through Thy command and will - to purify Thy servants from all that preventeth them from beholding Thy beauty, turning toward Thy direction, and drawing nigh unto the seat of Thy command.

With this knowledge, how can I praise Thee and make mention of Thee? Therefore do I testify, O my God, that I am evanescent, and have no power of mention or praise befitting Thy most exalted Self, nor can there appear from one who is evanescent that which can ascend unto Him Who abideth through His own being. By Thy glory, O my Beloved! My evanescence is worthy of Thy enduring favors, and my powerlessness seeketh Thy all-encompassing gifts. I beseech Thee by Thy First Word and by Thy Greatest Sign that Thou withhold not from me that which is with Thee. Then send down upon me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones.

Thou hast gathered it at this time in the most excellent form within this ancient Temple, that all who are in the heavens and earth might be gathered within and through it, that all might stand to account before Thy Self, without any soul becoming aware or counting it or comprehending it, that all the blessings might be perfected therein from the blessings of Thy holy oneness and the bounties of the glory of Thy lordship, that it might tell of the creation of all things on the day of meeting with Thee and the appearance of Thy days and the rising of the sun of Thy beauty. And at the mention of that supreme honor and mighty gift and the attractions of yearning for Thee and the dominions of Thy love and the passions of longing for Thee, I heard the call of one of Thy servants who believed in Thee and Thy verses, who turned away from all existing things and advanced toward the countenance of Thy beauty, who hastened from all directions to the place of Thy settling, until he stood at Thy door and arose at the dawning of the lights of Thy eternal holiness from the horizon of the heaven of Thy oneness and the dayspring of the dawn of Thy eternality. He desired to ascend to the canopy of union with and meeting with Thee, and to abide in the seats of nearness to and proximity with Thee. Therefore, O my God, cause the dove of yearning for Thee to soar in his heart, then cause to flow from his inner heart the seas of Thy love, and from his tongue the wonders of Thy remembrance, and from his spirit the jewels of Thy praise. Then accept him, O my God, that he might be able to preserve in the hidden recesses of his secret this white light and this most hidden treasure, that he might be with Thy servant in the highest horizon and the most glorious companion. Verily Thou art at this time in the sanctuary of eternity and dost witness this crimson spirit and hear this sweetest melody at the pole of identity, the center of the cloud of unknowing. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the most exalted, the powerful, the mighty, the self-subsisting.</p>

<p>O Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God! He is the All-Knowing Herald! The Divine bounty became embodied and His mercy encompassed all. He aided with the hosts of His providence and generosity, and caused the honored Shaykh, upon him be My glory and favor, to attain unto presence, hearing and witnessing. He arrived several days ago and then took for himself an abode in the shade of the Divine Lote Tree. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn him with the ornament of resignation, trust and detachment. Verily He is the Protector of whosoever turns unto Him and the Helper of whosoever dwelleth within the precincts of His mercy. He is indeed among those who are secure, as recorded in His Perspicuous Book. In truth, they have been freed and delivered from the hosts of hatred and rancor and from the claws of tyranny and calumny. Well is it with him and with whosoever hath loved him and desired his salvation. Glory be unto God! Tyranny hath reached such a pass that none save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, is aware thereof. The glory of the Cause, its loftiness, its transcendence, justice and fairness have been put to flight. They regarded the divine counsels and heavenly admonitions as though they had never existed, and they abandoned that which would have brought glory to the Cause and to themselves, clinging instead to that which causeth loss, abasement and degradation. Glory be unto God! From a certain person in that city there occurred that which caused the heart of this Wronged One to lament and groan. It behooveth Us to conceal what hath befallen Us and to make mention of the loved ones of God in that place, among whom are he who was named Javad and Khalil and Karim, and those who attained My presence and heard the scratching of My Pen and beheld the horizon of the heaven of My grace. Upon them be My glory, My bounty and My mercy which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. The honored Shaykh made mention of Javad, upon him be the grace of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, and hath sought for him and his kin that which leadeth to the exaltation of their station and the elevation of their rank. The glory from Our presence be upon you, O My friends and loved ones, and upon those who have laid hold of the hem of the robe of their Lord’s tender mercy, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

It would be good if you would proceed to Lahore or Kashmir or other places. You should certainly investigate yourself and go to whichever city you deem suitable. These matters are for your own benefit. They have also mentioned that there is one named Aqa ’Abdu’l-Husayn there who is very trustworthy and honest and is also knowledgeable in the preparation of food. If deemed advisable, they may refer their services to him. This too depends on your judgment.</p>

God willing, may they be joyous and adorned with the ornament of health and occupied with the remembrance of God. They have written from Nayriz that their relatives do not intend to proceed in that direction, but rather intend to go to Yazd. We wrote to those parts that if they are willing, they should send them and provide whatever is needed for the journey expenses. We shall pay it back soon.</p>
<p>Do not be saddened by affairs. Whatever comes to pass is assuredly for the best, and right is with you, and universal outpourings are ordained for you. All send their greetings with utmost longing. Write daily that which will bring joy to all. The purpose of mentioning Rida is that no ill-feeling or conflict should arise or be created there.

<p>O Siyyid Nasru’llah who hath attained Our presence and gained the victory - He beholdeth from His Most Exalted Horizon. Victory hath come, and through it the Standard of Power hath been hoisted upon the highest ensigns, from God, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Verily victory is that which hath spoken before the faces of the world and summoned all to the Mighty, the Bestower. Through it the pillars of polytheism were shaken and the Sun of Divine Unity shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge. Through it the Hidden Secret was revealed and all things proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End!”</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! Thou art he who turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon when the Wronged One was imprisoned in Akka. Thou didst enter and behold, and didst hear the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven. Thou didst believe in Him Who was established upon the Throne of Evidence through wisdom and utterance. Remind My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness which hath encompassed all horizons. Say: Your names have been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen as a favor from God, the Lord of Lords. We counsel you to preserve that which ye have been given from the presence of One Who is Compassionate, All-Bountiful. By My life! The mention of the world cannot be compared with My mention - to this doth testify He with Whom is the knowledge of the Book.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Thou seest my condition and hearest my lamentation. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Realm of Might and Kingdom, and by that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me Thy Hidden Secret and Thy Treasured Symbol, for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of reunion through the hands of grace and bounty, for having caused me to hear Thy Most Sweet Call and to behold the lights of Thy Countenance from Thy Most Exalted Horizon. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of Immortality, by the sovereignty of the Names, to assist me to serve Thy Cause amongst Thy servants and to mention Thee and praise Thee throughout Thy lands. O Lord! The weary one hath turned toward the Kingdom of Thy utterance, the hopeful one toward the Realm of Thy bounty, and the distant one toward the court of Thy nearness. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which he seeketh from the clouds of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy grace. Then ordain for him the good of this world and the next.

This indeed is a great bounty. And if you wish to know what hath befallen Me in this Prison at the hands of the hosts of the idolaters, know that the Ancient Beauty hath been afflicted at the hands of the people of the Bayan, these idolaters, even as ’Ali was afflicted at the hands of the people of the Furqan, and Muhammad at the hands of the people of the Gospel, and the Spirit at the hands of the Jews. Thus was the matter decreed against this lonely Wronged One. Then know that from Shin three, then Fa, Nun and Kha and Sin, then Qaf and Ya, and the first, then the second and the third, and Shin - they were sent in a temple and rose up against Me in battle.

Evil indeed is the abode of the deniers! All things weep for Me, for by his actions the sanctity of God hath been violated amongst all created things. But grieve not for what hath befallen Us, for this is God’s way with His chosen ones in centuries past. Therefore be patient, show forth patience, then stand firm in the Cause.

<p>That which thou didst address to God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, hath reached Us in the Prison. This is better for thee than all that hath been created on earth. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have answered thee in truth as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is He Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. In His right hand is the kingdom of names, and within His grasp the dominion of the realms of eternity. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>At the moment when thou didst open thy lips in remembrance of God, the Lord of Names, We heard it and answered thee in truth, and ordained for thee in the Most Glorious Pavilion a station that was illumined by the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great. Wert thou to become aware of what We have ordained for thee, thou wouldst soar on the wings of longing in the atmosphere of detachment and behold all who are in creation beneath the shadow of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised.</p>
<p>When thou dost inhale the fragrance of the verses which have descended from the right hand of the throne of thy Lord, the Lord of Names and Attributes, turn thy face toward the Prison and say: O my Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to soar in the atmosphere of Thy knowledge and to turn toward the sanctuary of Thy certitude and the Kaaba of Thy presence. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the tongue of all things hath spoken in praise of Thy Self, to make me in all conditions to gaze toward the direction of Thy good-pleasure and whatsoever Thou hast ordained for me in the heaven of Thy decree. Then make me to be detached from the cawing of those who have disbelieved in Thy signs, of whom Thou hast informed us in Thy Tablets. Cause me, O my God, to be so steadfast in Thy love that were all who are on earth to claim the stations of Thy Cause and the conditions of Thy Manifestation, I would not turn toward them, for I bear witness that the seal of the Manifestation of God is set in this Most Great Revelation, and whosoever layeth claim to a Revelation speaketh through the promptings of self and passion. Thus hath it been inscribed by Thy Most Exalted Pen upon the Tablets which have been adorned with the ornament of Thy words, O Creator of the heavens! I am certain, O my God, that Thou hast answered what I have beseeched of Thee and ordained for me what I have desired, through Thy grace and bounty.

Blessed is he who hath understood and soared with his heart to a station which the pens and tongues of the speakers are powerless to describe. At times thou seest it as the water of life whereby We quickened the hearts of them who have recognized Us; at times thou beholdest it as fire whereby the veils of idle fancy were consumed and hearts were turned toward the countenance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Luminous. Thus have We caused to flow from the Most Exalted Pen the Salsabil of remembrance and praise as a grace from Our presence unto thee and unto them who are with thee from among God’s sincere servants.

Sanctify your hearts from the veils of vain imaginings and desires, then look with the eye of fairness upon the signs of your Lord and that which hath been sent down from a heaven of exalted glory.

Your honor dwelt for a time beneath the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree, and observed the utterances of the Tree and its ways, and became aware of the compassion and bounty of God towards all. Now consider in what station of loftiness of wisdom and exaltation of mercy is God, and in what station are the people. We commanded all to love and fellowship, they arose in discord. We summoned them to wisdom, they failed to respond. As you have heard, in some lands differences appeared among the friends, and likewise in some cities actions contrary to wisdom were manifest, such that the clamor of the polytheists and hypocrites was raised in certain known places which you yourself mentioned. The cause of the exile of the loved ones of God from Iraq was their gathering together, and likewise the cause of exile from the Land of Mystery. Nevertheless, none heeds or has heeded that which is forbidden, save whom God willeth. Although exile became the cause of establishment and departure became the cause of the spread of the Cause of God, yet since outwardly harm from gatherings befalls the Tree itself, the friends of God must avoid it and cause their will to be extinguished in His will. Blessed art thou for having appeared before the Throne by the leave of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.

I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs, and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty among all beings, and by Thy radiant and manifest light, and Thy firm and unshakeable Cause, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise in Thy service. O my Lord! Thou knowest and seest that I have taken no helper for myself other than Thee, nor any supporter besides Thee. I beseech Thee, O Light of the world, by Thy Most Great Name through which the limbs of the nations trembled, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and cause me to enter the precincts of Thy glory. O my Lord! Thou seest the weak one clinging to the cord of Thy strength. I beseech Thee not to deprive him of what is with Thee. Verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O Shafi’, the sections were sent. We beseech God that He may deliver them. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

<p>O Husayn-Quli Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God! In My Name which shineth forth from the horizon of the Kingdom. This is a Book sent down by the King of Omnipotence unto him who hath turned to My horizon and heard My call and directed his heart unto the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth, before the creation of all beings: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower!” By God! There hath appeared that which had never appeared before, and the Speaker of Sinai, Who was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords, hath spoken. The story of the Fire hath returned in the Sinai of the righteous and calleth out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven: “The Promise hath come, and the Lord of Names hath appeared with the hosts of revelation and the standards of signs!” Can any among the divines vie with Me in the arena of utterance? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Say: Fear ye God and follow not your idle fancies which are indeed idols, if ye be among the possessors of insight. We have heard thy call aforetime and that wherewith thou didst call upon God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. We answer thee with this Tablet which God hath made a light unto the righteous and a fire unto the wicked. Thou didst attain unto My mention aforetime, and in this hour when the All-Merciful hath ascended the throne of utterance with power and sovereignty. Say: O people of the Qur’an, know ye your station! Ye made mention of Me throughout ages and centuries, yet when the fingers of might rent asunder the veils and shrouds, ye pronounced judgment against Me with such tyranny as caused the pillars to tremble. Ye arose at My mention, yet when I manifested Myself unto you, ye arose with swords of hatred and committed that which caused the hearts of the people of the cities of justice and equity to be sorely troubled. Say: O people of the Bayan, We behold you as We beheld them. Soon shall ye reap from the trees of your deeds the fruits which they reaped before. Take ye heed, O ye who are endued with insight! We counsel thee and those who have believed to remain steadfast with utmost steadfastness in this Cause whereby the lights have shone forth. We have heard thy verse and prose in the love and praise of God. It behooveth thee to thank Him for having aided thee unto this bounty which the treasuries of the earth cannot equal. He Who possesseth the Mother Book beareth witness unto this.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station of grandeur and power! Praise be unto Thee, O my God, inasmuch as Thou beholdest that the Sun of independence hath ever been dawning from the horizon of the temples of glory - they who have rent asunder the veils of grandeur, who have quaffed the choice wine of reunion, and who have attained unto the lights of beauty in the days when Thou didst come with the heaven of Thy Cause upon the clouds of grandeur and power, when trembling seized all the tribes of the earth. And among them, O my God, is this Name who was named with the two Most Exalted Names, who turned wholly unto Thee, detached from all the worlds, who took no beloved save Thee and no object of desire except Thee. Therefore dost Thou behold him, O my Beloved, consumed by the fire of separation from Thee and enkindled by the flame of longing for Thee. Ordain for him, O Fire of the hearts of lovers, that which shall make him, in separation, attain unto the lights of Thy reunion and presence, and in remoteness, drink from the cup of Thy nearness and glory. For verily Thou didst desire him and ordained for him a station upon the Most Exalted Throne which none can reach save they who have beheld Thee with Thine eye and known Thee through Thy Self, the Mighty, [the Inaccessible].</p>

All must hearken with the ear of acceptance. O friends! Goodly character, praiseworthy deeds, and human attributes have been and shall ever be the cause of exalting the Word of God and promoting His Cause. Therefore it is incumbent and obligatory upon every soul to hold fast today unto that which is righteous and to shun that which is forbidden. Many souls have claimed to believe, yet through their deeds the most pure and luminous hem of the Lord of destiny hath been sullied among men. Convey My greetings to the friends and recite unto them that which hath flowed in this Tablet from the divine Pen, that they may become aware of that which is for their good and shun that which causeth harm to themselves and others. The world hath been seized and encompassed by the dark and gloomy dust. The carpet of inner meaning and deeds hath been rolled up, and the carpet of words and utterances hath been spread out. Say: O loved ones! By the Sun of Truth, this is the Day of deeds. If today even an atom’s weight of goodly action proceedeth from anyone, its reward shall endure for him throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Strive that today a deed may appear from you purely for the sake of God. Unity and concord are beloved in the sight of the Lord of creation. Gather ye together in God’s Law and be ye not of them that differ. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We have made mention of thee that thou mayest mention the people with that which hath been sent down from the presence of the All-Knowing Educator. Give thou glad tidings to the loved ones of My remembrance of them, then bid them to that which they have been bidden by God, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise. They that have borne hardships in the path of God - for them hath been ordained an exalted station. Blessed is he who hath shown patience, seeking the good-pleasure of God. We make mention of him in truth, and the Concourse on High make mention of him. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

O joy to those breezes by which the paradise of the hearts of those near to God is concealed! And blessed is the tongue that has spoken the mention of the All-Merciful among all possibilities, and the heart from which has flowed the Salsabil of the love of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing! I beseech Him, exalted be He, that through the waters of your remembrances of the King of Names, He may revive the trees of the hearts of His servants who have been heedless of the Most Great, Supreme Announcement and His Ancient and Most Great Remembrance, that He may make all the Divine Lote-Trees of knowledge among the contingent beings, and cause all to speak forth your call and testify that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Be it known that after observing the luminous letter, it was presented at the threshold of the Throne. The petition that had been submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence was presented in its entirety before the Face. A wondrous and sublime Tablet has been revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for your honor, and likewise all the names that you had written were presented before the Throne. Infinite favors have been shown to all, and specifically for each name a sublime Tablet has been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will and sent forth. God willing, may all attain to them and, through the fragrances of the revealed verses - from a single breath of which the realities of Paradise are set in motion and stirred - arise with a wondrous spirit and sublime form to serve the Cause and manifest that which is befitting of this Day. And that is first to sanctify the self from all else save God, and then to appear with praiseworthy characteristics, commendable attributes, and goodly remembrances among humanity, that through their breaths the horizons may be perfumed and through their lights all things may be illumined. By God! They are the people of Baha among all creatures. Upon them be the glory of God and the glory of all the worlds.

<p>Observe and reflect upon what hath come to pass in the world. The divines and mystics of the earth were, night and day, supplicating and yearning to attain unto the presence of the Divine Day which was mentioned and recorded in the Books. Whenever they would hear the word “Qa’im” they would all rise up in reverence to His name and utter the words “May God hasten His relief.” Throughout this time they failed to perceive what distress existed that they should seek relief for His Holiness from God. They were deprived of understanding this matter. Furthermore, when the horizon of the world was illumined with the light of the appearance of the Most Great Herald, all arose in opposition and inflicted upon that blessed Being, Who was in truth a divine subtlety and a celestial melody, that which hath been heard and witnessed. And when afterwards the Sun of Truth dawned from the Horizon of Will, it was observed what they said and what they committed. In truth the Pen is powerless to recount it. To prove their contentions they cling to the Book while remaining heedless of and turning away from the Mother Book. More remote than these souls are the people of the Bayan, who have been and continue to be deprived by the buzzing of a fly from the divine melody, and who have remained far from the Lord of Lords. Now consider the worth and station of the souls who have accepted the Faith. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance that these souls have no peer or likeness, for the greatest veil, which was the divines of the age, did not prevent them from the Truth, exalted be His glory. With the arm of certitude they shattered the idols of vain imaginings and turned toward the Lord of this manifest Day. Blessed are ye for having attained unto this most exalted station, to which the Lord of creation hath testified in His mighty prison. I counsel you and My loved ones to remain steadfast in this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause. The glory be upon you from God, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

We send greetings to the friends and likewise to the family, and we counsel all to act according to what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Furqan. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Indeed, the news of the occupation of the apple of my eye, ’Inayatu’llah, was a cause of joy and gladness. Praise and thanks be to God. However, you must be informed of his movements, for he is a child and requires education.</p>

<p>O Muhammad, in the name of the peerless one God! Your call reached the Most Holy and Luminous Threshold, and whatsoever you mentioned, this servant presented it. That which is beloved today is steadfastness in the Cause, and this matter is greater than what may occur to the heart or the realm of imagination can enumerate. Ask of the exalted Truth to make you successful in attaining a drop from this ocean. Consider the divines of the age who, though they waited night and day for the Truth and would say from the pulpits “May God hasten His coming,” when the horizon of the world was illumined with the Sun of Manifestation, all arose in opposition and strove with hands of tyranny and hypocrisy to preserve their leadership. They passed by the Truth and what pertains to Him, and remained content with their own idle fancies and vain imaginings. They are seen to be deprived and forbidden from the sealed wine and the ocean of the bounty of the Self-Subsisting Name. Although they witness at all times the transience of the world, nevertheless some are heedless, some fearful, some agitated, some bewildered, and some veiled. Consider the King of Martyrs, that is, the name of Ha’ - upon him be all the most glorious Glory. He attained to such a station, though he himself had beseeched the Truth, glorified and exalted be He, for numbered years. When he attained unto it, most souls became agitated, although the Truth aided him and adorned him with the ornament of might and exaltation. At the end of his life he reached a station which all the Prophets and Messengers and near-brought angels at all times beseech and hope for. Now all must be thankful to the Truth - exalted be His dominion and magnified be His power - not agitated and fearful. By My life! They have not found the sweetness of this station and are pleased and occupied with the ornaments and things of the world. And God speaks the Truth and He guides the Way. Verily He has power over all things.</p>

This is a Book from the Unseen to the visible world, that none may witness save what God witnessed before the creation of all things: that there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. O people! Fear God and follow not those who understand not. Those who have heard the verses of God - they are a divine people, around whom circle servants of the realm of oneness. Thus has flowed from the Pen the Kawthar of pre-existence, sprinkling upon all created things that they may turn unto God, the Lord of Lords. O people! Beware lest the manifestations of glory prevent you from the Dawning-Place of beauty. Break the idols by the power of God, the Mighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. He commands you with truth, but the people understand not. Say: O people! Names are but creations by His command. Rend asunder the veils and be not of those who join partners with God. Say: This indeed is the Purpose. These are His verses sent down in truth, and at His right hand is the wine of life - happy are they who drink thereof. O servant! Grieve not at anything, but place thy trust in God. He suffices thee in truth, and He knows what is in the hearts. Those who are debarred from this bounty - they understand not. Convey the Cause of thy Lord and be not silent in His remembrance. By His remembrance are quickened the hearts of those who turn to the court of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Best-Beloved. By His remembrance are set ablaze the hearts of the righteous and the Nightingale of Manifestation warbles. Whoso attains to His remembrance and stands firm in His love has indeed attained to all good. Thus has it been ordained by God, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: O people of the Bayan! Deny not Him Who has come with the truth from the presence of One mighty, powerful. He has come as ’Ali came from the heaven of the Cause with manifest sovereignty, and He commands you but what ’Ali commanded before. Fear God and be not of the deniers. Follow the religion of God and differ not therein. This indeed is a mighty counsel. Whoso heeds thy counsel does so for his own sake, and whoso turns away does so to his own loss. The Messenger’s duty is but to deliver the clear Message. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

He who forsaketh that which he hath been commanded, verily, he is in manifest error. Say: Beware lest ye be like unto them who have turned away from the Face and followed every rebellious devil.

Dispute not concerning the verses of God, and deny not Him through Whom the Tree of the Furthermost Boundary hath borne fruit, the heaven of destiny hath been upraised, and the Dove of Eternity hath warbled upon the twigs of the Tree of Paradise - this Most Holy, Most Wondrous, and Most Beauteous Spot. Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and deny not the verses of the All-Merciful which have been sent down in truth with the hosts of revelation from the heaven of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. They who have denied this Revelation, these have not believed in God from time immemorial, to this all things bear witness, yet the people are in grievous error. Do ye worship the calf and oppose God, the Lord of all worlds? Say: This is He Who was promised in all the Tablets, if ye be of them that know. And this, verily, is He Who was intended in the Books of God, the Ancient of Days. Say: The Qa’im is he who hath arisen to promote My Cause, and the Guardian is he who hath circled round the Kaaba of My Beauty, and the Imam is he who hath sacrificed his soul in My path, if ye be of them that understand. And thou, sever thyself from all else but Me, then speak My praise amongst My servants, that perchance they may arise from the sleep of heedlessness and passion, and turn with their hearts to the Perspective of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon the sincere servants of God, and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>He is the Most Glorious! Stand firm in the Cause of God, then gather the people unto the law of His love lest they differ in the Cause of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Be thou enkindled that the people may be enkindled through thy love. Thus doth command thee the Pen of Command from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Beware lest thou tarry in rendering assistance. Convey that which hath been revealed unto thee and be not silent in the remembrance of God, the Beloved of the worlds. Convey greetings from thy Lord to thy mother, brother and sister, then to the faces of Our assured servants.</p>

<p>This is a mighty Tablet revealed from the Kingdom of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In each word surgeth the ocean of names from the Fashioner of earth and heaven. Blessed are they that comprehend. And in each verse thereof is ordained the creation of that which none knoweth save God, the Lord of all worlds. They whose eyes are illumined with the light of recognition, these shall behold in My traces the beauty of the All-Merciful. Thus have We expounded the Cause from the presence of One knowing, wise. They who have forsaken that which is with the people and have turned with their hearts to the Dawning-Place of inspiration, these are of the people of Baha, as attesteth that which hath been sent down in a preserved Tablet. Say: O people, follow not your desires, follow rather guidance. Verily it hath appeared in truth from the horizon of the Will of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Beware lest the world prevent you from turning to the Kingdom of immortality, or the hosts of the oppressors frighten you. Remember your Lord amongst My servants, that perchance they may recognize their Creator and be drawn by the traces of truth to the scene of His mighty Name. They who are heedless and have turned away, these are cursed by the atoms, though they are today among those who rejoice. Then shall chastisement come upon them from every direction, whereupon their faces shall be seen turned yellow from fear of thy Lord, the Subduer, the Mighty, the Powerful. When the idolaters drove Us from the Land of Mystery, We called out to the servants with the most exalted call and summoned them unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Until they cast Us into another prison, whereupon We arose with another call and conveyed the Command of thy Lord to kings and monarchs. That which befell Us did not prevent Us from His remembrance, and that which appeared is a witness to what is recorded. But the people are in evident veils. Through His love, no harm from those in the worlds can dismay Us, nor can what the hands of the aggressors have wrought sadden Us. Thus have We set forth the verses for thee and sent them down in truth that thou mayest find the sweetness of the table that hath descended from heaven. By My life, through it shall thy face shine forth amongst Our hesitating servants. Blessed is he who readeth what hath been sent down from the direction of the Throne and pondereth My Cause. He is of those brought near. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>He is the One who abides through the abiding of His Essence</p>
<p>This is a Tablet from this servant who glories in his servitude to God, Who created him by a command from His presence, awakened him from his slumber, and made him among those who remember, unto those who have believed in God and are secure from the greatest terror. Say: O people! Blessed are ye for having attained unto the recognition of God and the Manifestation of His Self, and for having detached yourselves from the idolaters. Hold fast to the cord of God - verily it is His Most Great, Most Mighty Remembrance. Then call upon Him that He may make you steadfast in His love and protect you from those who have disbelieved in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Verily He hath need of no one, and He is indeed independent of what hath been and what shall be. That which He commandeth His servants is out of His grace, were ye to be among those who know. He desireth for no one save that which will draw him nigh unto the sacred court, the station wherein whosoever entereth will behold himself as a mirror of His beauty, the Mighty, the Wondrous. O people! Detach yourselves from all save God, your Lord, and turn unto Him with radiant countenance. Verily His herald calleth you at all times and summoneth you unto the perspective of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Turn your hearts at all times unto Him and He will suffice you against all created things. In His right hand is a chalice of the Kawthar of immortality and He saith: Come and drink, O people of Baha, and be not of the patient ones. Whoso drinketh a drop therefrom shall abide through the abiding of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves thereof, for whoso is deprived is in manifest loss. And thou, O servant, take the chalice with power from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Then drink therefrom in the name of thy Lord and be not of them that hesitate. Though thou hast drunk before - and verily thy Lord is All-Knowing, All-Informed - yet God commandeth thee once again that He may thereby purify thy breast from all allusions and thou mayest attain unto manifest assurance. The Spirit and glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned unto Me with a pure and radiant heart.</p>

<p>This is the Day whereon He Who conversed with God upon Sinai hath seated Himself upon the throne of Manifestation before all faces, calling aloud with the most exalted utterance and summoning all who are on earth and in heaven unto the Supreme Horizon - that station wherein hath shone forth the Sun of knowledge by the command of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Ja’far! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the Most Great Scene and saith: By God! He hath come, the Lord of all beings, through Whom every hidden matter was revealed, the moon was cleft asunder, the trumpet was sounded, and all upon earth were struck down save those whom God, thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willed to spare. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have beheld thy turning toward the lights of the Countenance. We have sent down for thee that whereby the Concourse on High and the exalted Paradise were attracted, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged, and the gate of knowledge been opened, and the tongue of grandeur hath spoken: There is none other God but Me, the Ancient Commander. I have manifested My Self and sent down My verses, and I am the Powerful over what I will, and I am the Dominant, the Mighty, the Wise. When thou didst find the fragrance of My most sweet utterance and didst hear the trilling of My Most Exalted Pen, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, for having aided me, guided me, taught me and caused me to know Thee when I was heedless of Thy manifestation, Thy sovereignty, Thy attributes and Thy revelations. I beseech Thee by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby all created things were set in motion, and by its trilling, whereby the denizens of the cities of names and attributes were attracted, to confirm me in steadfastness unto Thy Most Great Cause and Thy Mighty Message. O my Lord! The fire of Thy love hath enkindled me and my heart hath melted in separation and remoteness from Thee. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy generosity and the stars of the heaven of Thy grace to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have attained unto Thy days, circumambulated Thy throne, and hastened to the place of sacrifice out of longing to meet Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

Say: O people! The fragrance of the Merciful’s utterance hath wafted throughout all contingent being. Beware lest the veils of the world prevent you or the might of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed strike fear in your hearts. Say: Fear ye God, O people! By God, the Day which God’s Messengers and chosen ones foretold hath come. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which hath appeared in truth from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Say: Be fair, O concourse of the earth, concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and follow not every ignorant rejected one. The gate of bounty hath been opened upon all existence and the ocean of generosity hath surged in the world. Draw nigh with illumined hearts and be not of those who are unaware. Vain imaginings have held them back from the Sovereign of knowledge, and idle fancies from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Behold with your eyes and ponder that which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of this exalted House. The servant who was present hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One. We have answered thee with this beloved Tablet which calleth in the kingdom of creation and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust below. Blessed is he who heareth and respondeth, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest me detached from all save Thee, attracted by Thy verses, speaking Thy praise and arising to serve Thy Cause. I beseech Thee by the mysteries hidden in Thy knowledge and the signs treasured in Thy Pen to confirm me and my son in turning unto the lights of Thy countenance and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. Then ordain for us, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world and the Lord of all nations, that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and the good of the Hereafter and of this world.

<p>O Afnan, his honor Aqa Mirza Aqa! He is the Comforter, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! This is a day wherein the Tree of Utterance hath spoken at the heart of creation concerning that which hath appeared in the realm of origination and that which hath befallen its branches. Sorrows have encompassed Me by reason of your grief, as witnessed by the Divine Lote-Tree and its branches. Oceans of inner meanings have flowed from the Pen of Utterance, and the verses are their waves. The Maid of Heaven hath wailed in the most exalted Paradise, and the tears of dawn are her weeping. The heaven of existence hath changed by reason of what hath befallen it, and the redness visible on the horizon is its sighing. He is the Consoler, and He is the Comforter.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! Upon thee be the glory of God, His loving-kindness, His peace, His grace and His bounty. That honored and ascended handmaiden did, throughout the nights and days, cherish the desire to attain the presence and meet the Afnan. Her heart was yearning, her tongue speaking, her eyes watching, and her being waiting. However, God’s irrevocable decree intervened and that which was inscribed in the Tablet was made manifest.</p>
<p>O My Afnan! This clay-coated world was not and is not worthy of pure, tender hearts and holy, gentle temples. Therefore, movement is more beloved than stillness, and ascension more excellent than remaining. Were God, exalted be His glory, to unveil the hidden mysteries even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would turn to Him and seek ascension. However, in accordance with the requirements of wisdom, they remain concealed. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We have revealed for her that which the riches of the world and the mention of all nations cannot equal. That which will bring solace to the eyes of her people and the handmaidens of the earth hath been ordained for her. We beseech God to send down upon her at all times a blessing from His presence and a mercy from His side. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of the son and console him with that which hath been sent down in the Tablet from God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Peace and glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those who are there, and upon all who are steadfast and firm.</p>

<p>He is the Witness from His most exalted horizon. This is the Day wherein the Mother Book speaks, yet most of the people neither know nor hear. The proof has been perfected and the Cry has been raised and the Rock has cried out, yet most of the people are heedless. The signs have encompassed them from every direction, yet they see not. They pass by the signs of God and His manifestations, yet they understand not. They have denied the Truth and His proof, and turned away from His Cause and His sovereignty, having followed the embodiments of idle fancies and vain imaginings. I know not by what proof their faith is established, and for what reason they have turned away from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Baqir! When thou didst hear the call from the most exalted horizon, and the wine of thy Lord’s utterance, the Lord of all beings, did intoxicate thee, say: My God, my God! My outer and inner tongue bear witness to Thy oneness and singleness, and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. I testify that Thou hast appeared and made manifest Thy Cause before the faces of Thy creation, and with the finger of Thy power hast rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and the curtains of vain imaginings, such that the oppression of every oppressor and the turning away of every heedless one did not prevent Thee. Thou didst arise with supreme steadfastness and called all to Thy most exalted horizon. Among them were those who heard the call and hastened until they drank the wine of recognition from the cup of Thy bounty, and among them were those who hesitated, and those who turned away, and those who pronounced sentence of death against Thee.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou seest Thy servant standing at the door of Thy grandeur, clinging to the cord of Thy grace, and awaiting the wonders of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee by the hearts that were melted in Thy love, and by the breasts that were pierced by the arrows of the enemies to exalt Thy Word, that Thou make me detached from all else save Thee and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. O my Lord! Withhold me not from the river of Thy bounty which has flowed from the Pen of Thy grace. Then make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, such that neither the crushing doubts of the learned nor the tempestuous allusions of the divines may move me. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>

Blessed is he who hath heard and witnessed what God hath witnessed. And woe unto every perfidious denier who rejected God’s proof and evidence, and committed that which caused the near ones to lament.</p>

We beseech God to aid all to adorn themselves, through the traces of the Most Exalted Pen, with dignity and composure and patience and forbearance and righteousness and all that beseemeth man.

I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the sole Desire of them that have recognized Thee, and the Object of the adoration of the entire creation, not to suffer them, now that Thou hast attracted them by Thy most exalted Word, to be far removed from the Tabernacle which Thou hast reared up by Thy name, the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>They are sore pressed with cares, O my Lord, and are encompassed about by the wicked. Send down, therefore, from the heaven of Thy behest Thine invisible hosts, that, holding aloft the ensigns of Thy victory, they may help them in Thy land, and may shield them against Thine adversaries.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, O my God, by Thy name through which the clouds have rained down their rain, and the streams have flowed, and the fire of Thy love hath been enkindled throughout Thy dominion, to assist Thy servant who hath turned towards Thee, and hath spoken forth Thy praise, and determined to help Thee. Fortify, then, his heart, O my God, in Thy love and in Thy Faith. Better is this for him than all that hath been created on Thine earth, for the world and whatsoever is therein must perish, and what pertaineth unto Thee must endure as long as Thy most excellent names endure. By Thy Glory! Were the world to last as long as Thine own kingdom will last, to set their affections upon it would still be unseemly for such as have quaffed, from the hands of Thy mercy, the wine of Thy presence; how much more when they recognize its fleetingness and are persuaded of its transience. The chances that overtake it, and the changes to which all things pertaining unto it are continually subjected, attest its impermanence.</p>
<p>Whosoever hath recognized Thee will turn to none save Thee, and will seek from Thee naught else except Thyself. Thou art the sole Desire of the heart of him whose thoughts are fixed on Thee, and the highest Aspiration of whosoever is wholly devoted unto Thee.</p>
<p>No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.</p>

<p>O my God and my Lord! I call upon Thee now with that call which Thou didst inspire me with from the wonders of the bounty of Thy oneness and didst teach me from the essences of the grace of Thine eternity, for verily the call in its essence, were it not from Thee, could never reach Thee, could never appear before Thee, and could never ascend to the atmosphere of nearness unto Thee. And since Thou hast made this known to me, therefore it behooveth that Thou inspire me with that which befitteth Thyself and is worthy of Thy majesty, that the call of this lowly one may ascend to the heaven of Thy holy might, and the cry of this transient one may soar to the atmosphere of the glory of Thy permanence, and this poor one may wing his flight in the atmosphere of nearness to Thy riches. For other than Thee none can enter the realms of Thy description save through the keys of Thy mercy, and naught beside Thee can descend upon the shore of Thy knowledge save through Thy might and power. Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my Best-Beloved! Thou art He Who hath ever been self-sufficient through the sovereignty of Thy Being and wilt ever remain sanctified through the sanctification of Thy Self. All the mystics confess their powerlessness to know the manifestations of Thy oneness, and all the eloquent ones acknowledge their poverty in attaining to the dawning-places of Thy singleness. By Thy might, O Thou my heart’s Desire! All the most eloquent ones are mute in describing Thy beauty, and all the learned ones are ignorant before the appearances of Thy knowledge and Thy glory. Therefore I beseech Thee, O Thou Fire of the hearts of the lovers and O Thou Rapture of the breasts of the yearning ones, by Thy most beautiful names in the canopies of eternity, and by Thy spiritual lights in the Concourse on High, and by Thy Beloved through Whom were sealed the wonders of Thy names and through Whom were completed all Thy attributes in the Kingdom of Thy permanence, that Thou shut not the doors of Thy great mercy in our faces, and close not the gates of Thy supreme bounty upon our hearts. Then cause us to witness in all things the signs of Thy Lordship and the lights of Thine eternity, that through Thy power we may gather upon the carpet of Thy oneness and in the places of Thy glorification. Then make us, O my God, to walk in the ways of Thy good-pleasure and to be content at the descent of Thy decree, in such wise that we fear none save Thee and turn to none except Thee, for in Thy hands is the kingdom of all things and Thou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Omnipotent.</p>

<p>My God, my Well-Beloved! No place is there for any one to flee to when once Thy laws have been sent down, and no refuge can be found by any soul after the revelation of Thy commandments. Thou hast inspired the Pen with the mysteries of Thine eternity, and bidden it teach man that which he knoweth not, and caused him to partake of the living waters of truth from the cup of Thy Revelation and Thine inspiration.</p>
<p>No sooner, however, had the Pen traced upon the tablet one single letter of Thy hidden wisdom, than the voice of the lamentation of Thine ardent lovers was lifted up from all directions. Thereupon, there befell the just what hath caused the inmates of the tabernacle of Thy glory to weep and the dwellers of the cities of Thy revelation to groan.</p>
<p>Thou dost consider, O my God, how He Who is the Manifestation of Thy names is in these days threatened by the swords of Thine adversaries. In such a state He crieth out and summoneth all the inhabitants of Thine earth and the denizens of Thy heaven unto Thee.</p>
<p>Purify, O my God, the hearts of Thy creatures with the power of Thy sovereignty and might, that Thy words may sink deep into them. I know not what is in their hearts, O my God, nor can tell the thoughts they think of Thee. Methinks that they imagine that Thy purpose in calling them to Thine all-highest horizon is to heighten the glory of Thy majesty and power. For had they been satisfied that Thou summonest them to that which will recreate their hearts and immortalize their souls, they would never have fled from thy governance, nor deserted the shadow of the tree of Thy oneness. Clear away, then, the sight of Thy creatures, O my God, that they may recognize Him Who showeth forth the Godhead as One Who is sanctified from all that pertaineth unto them, and Who, wholly for Thy sake, is summoning them to the horizon of Thy unity, at a time when every moment of His life is beset with peril. Had His aim been the preservation of His own Self, He would never have left it at the mercy of Thy foes.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory! I have accepted to be tried by manifold adversities for no purpose except to regenerate all that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth. Whoso hath loved Thee, can never feel attached to his own self, except for the purpose of furthering Thy Cause; and whoso hath recognized Thee can recognize naught else except Thee, and can turn to no one save Thee.</p>
<p>Enable Thy servants, O my God, to discover the things Thou didst desire for them in Thy Kingdom. Acquaint them, moreover, with what He Who is the Origin of Thy most excellent titles hath, in His love for Thee, been willing to bear for the sake of the regeneration of their souls, that they may haste to attain the River that is Life indeed, and turn their faces in the direction of Thy Name, the Most Merciful. Abandon them not to themselves, O my God! Draw them, by Thy bountiful favor, to the heaven of Thine inspiration. They are but paupers, and Thou art the All-Possessing, the ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.</p>

<p>O My sister and My leaf! This wronged one’s sister was not with Us in this Cause and never saw Yahya during the days of this Wronged One’s manifestation. Nevertheless, she has clung to such calumnies as no ear has ever heard. According to reports, she claims that in previous years this Wronged One was expecting that Aqa Hasan, upon him be the glory of God, and obtained those Tablets and gave them to be written either in his own name or Yahya’s name, and gives them to people. She has likewise attempted to obtain the Kitab-i-Iqan, and her purpose is unknown. With God it is known and witnessed. Nothing escapes His knowledge and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. She has in her possession Yahya’s writings in Arabic and Persian, and every person of insight testifies to the loftiness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and its transcendence. Verily He has sent down that which the world is powerless to produce the like thereof. To this testifies every fair-minded and informed person. That which has shone forth from the horizon of My knowledge is more manifest than the sun and cannot be mistaken by anyone. Blessed is he who has attained unto it, and woe unto every deceitful denier. The sister opened the door of enmity with her own hand, and when her wrongdoing became apparent she turned away from the Truth, cut off relations with the Wronged One and attached herself to the Grand Vizier. That helpless daughter who for years bore the title of Branch, she took her, made her up, and sent her to the Vizier’s house. Now observe this lack of honor and zeal - she abandoned the Truth when she saw Him wronged, and clung to one possessed of wealth. And now she claims leadership. Glory be to God! To what point has God’s Cause come! O My leaf, reflect on what has befallen the Wronged One in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Give thanks to the Desired One of the world Who has mentioned thee in verses that will endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. We beseech God to protect thee and ordain for thee the good of this world and the next. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God! The fragrances of divine revelation have perfumed the realms of earth and heaven, and the effulgences of the Light of Manifestation have illumined the world. The accepted handmaiden hath been honored with the blessed word “O My handmaiden,” and the accepted servant glorified with “O My servant.” Today the gate of the most exalted Paradise hath been opened in the name of the Lord of Names, and hidden mysteries have become manifest and evident without any veil or concealment. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld the lights of the supreme horizon, and blessed is the ear that hath been honored to hear the call of the Desired One of the world and the Ancient King. Today the waves of the ocean of divine bounty are visible before all faces at their highest surge. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden, for thine ear hath hearkened to My call and thine eye hath witnessed My signs. Give glad tidings to the youth and say: The true rose garden hath appeared and the spiritual nightingales are warbling upon its branches and twigs. Strive that ye may not be deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord in this spiritual morn and luminous atmosphere. The Sun of generosity hath dawned from the horizon of the world, and through but one of its rays the world of existence came into being. O people of God! The Hidden Countenance hath unveiled Itself and the Treasured Secret become manifest and evident. With complete detachment, take and drink the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Mention each of their children on behalf of the Wronged One and convey greetings. We beseech God to aid them to be steadfast and to render victory. Today victory is through remembrance and utterance, not through sword and spear. Weapons have been transformed into means of peace, discord into concord, and war into peace. The Command is in God’s hands, the Possessor of the seen and unseen. He is the Powerful One Whom the power of the world hath not hindered and the might of nations hath not prevented from His purpose. O handmaiden of God! We have mentioned and continue to mention all the friends, and We counsel them to that which leadeth to elevation and advancement. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

The Day hath come, while the people wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and desire, among those who slumber. Say: O concourse of humanity! God hath revealed His greatest countenance and adorned it with this Name whereby every hidden matter was revealed and the Fire spoke from the trees. The veils have been rent asunder and the Lord of the Day of Return hath come with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all parties. Blessed is he who hath heard and hastened and attained, and woe unto the deniers and those who hesitate. O thou who art present before the Throne and gazest upon the Countenance! Soar on the wings of longing unto the heaven of wisdom and utterance and say: O peoples of the worlds! Rejoice and behold on this Day whereon He Who conversed on Sinai hath been established upon the throne of Revelation and hath said: By God! The blessed supreme verse “but He is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets” hath been fulfilled by the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. This is such a glad tiding that were it to be cast upon the trees, their branches would be seen to rise above the heavens, and were it cast upon the seas, the hidden pearls within their shells would appear, and were it cast upon the mountains, their mines and whatsoever lay concealed and treasured within them would be revealed. Blessed art thou, O thou who standest at the gate time and again, for what We have sent down unto thee whose fragrance hath been diffused throughout the worlds of wisdom and knowledge. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and this most perfect and complete remembrance, and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, for having opened before my face, through the key of Thy Most Glorious Name, the treasures of remembrance and praise and the pearls of glory and bounty. I beseech Thee to assist and enable me to achieve that which shall endure through the key of my name among Thy most excellent names. Then cause me, O my God, to be a spreader of Thy signs and attributes among all peoples. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>Thus have We adorned thy head with the crown of utterance and thy temple with the ornament of My glorious and wondrous remembrance.

Praise be to God that the veils of idle fancies have been rent asunder and the clouds of vain imaginings have been lifted. Thou didst turn and direct thyself to the Most Exalted Horizon until, through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, thou didst attain unto the presence and hearken unto the divine call and drink from the Kawthar of reunion. All this is from God’s grace and mercy upon thee - know thou this and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O Jalal! We counsel thee and all the friends to unity and harmony. Should any ill-feeling arise between you, arise at once to dispel it, for discord causeth the Word to be arrested while harmony promoteth its exaltation. Convey my greetings to the friends and say: Ye have witnessed the vain imaginings of the people of the Furqan (Muslims). Now the people of the Bayan cling to those same imaginings. Guard yourselves and take refuge in God. For twelve hundred years they made claims to knowledge and wisdom, yet the final outcome of the acts and words of the Shi’ih party was the decree to slay the Lord of the world. Now with utmost cunning the people of the Bayan have risen against the souls who have believed and are assured. God protect us and you from the evil of these people who, in both word and deed, are like unto the former party.</p>
<p>This is the Day of true unity wherein naught is mentioned save God, exalted be His glory. At all times be occupied with the triumph of the Cause of God, that is, guiding souls unto God, the Lord of creation. You must be so enkindled with the love of God that the heedless, upon witnessing it and its heat, will turn toward the Friend and drink from the cup of understanding. The relatives through mother, wife, mothers and sisters - all are remembered in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and mentioned by the Supreme Pen. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon thy two daughters and upon every maidservant who hath believed in God, the Lord of lords.</p>

Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen make mention of him who hath turned to the Most Glorious Horizon, as a token of grace from the All-Bountiful. The servant present before Us hath read thy supplication, which was honored to be heard by the Prisoner in this noble scene.

Therefore do I confess, O Beloved of my heart, Solace of mine eyes, my Lord and my King, that I am powerless to mention even a single leaf among the leaves of Thy most exalted Paradise which Thou didst create through Thy Most Glorious Name - how then could I be capable of making mention of Thee or speaking in praise of Thy Self? I testify that Thou hast ever been sanctified above the recognition of Thy creation and holy beyond the description of Thy servants. Since this is so, I make mention of what the tongue of Thy Revelation hath spoken in Thy Tablets: that Thou art not described except by Thyself and not mentioned save through Thyself. I beseech Thee to make this mention the crown of all mentions through Thy grace and favor, and to accept from me, through the wonders of Thy bounties, that which Thou hast taught me through Thy generosity. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, my Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We make mention of Our servant that We may give him the glad tidings of My gracious remembrance.

Taking up residence elsewhere would be acceptable and beloved. This is among the requirements of wisdom that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen.

The world hath changed, the mountain moveth, the sun speaketh, the vibration of the manifestation hath set Mount Sinai in motion. Glory be to God! It is as though the Resurrection is at hand and the Hour hath appeared. The one who led astray hath become a guide.” Say: “What have you to do with these errors? God’s mercy be upon one who knoweth his station and rank. When names were bestowed upon the world, thou wert not. Fear the Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Speak according to thy measure. Should We will, We could take a handful of dust and manifest from it name after name until names and their kingdoms come to an end.” Say: “If thou art thunderstruck by this compelling Word, it mattereth not,” for according to the blessed word that appeared from the Dawning-Place of the Primal Point, upon Him be the glory of God, the Lord of all beings, even the people of Sinai are thunderstruck, let alone others - this is clear and evident. Ask of God that He make manifest from among His servants that which is the cause of preservation and the means of deliverance. O Haydar! The rustling of the Tree is raised high, the effulgences of the rays of the Sun of Truth are dawning and manifest, and the light that was hidden in the divine treasury is brilliant and radiant. Yet the people are debarred. What hath been the cause of their being debarred? By God’s life! The misleader and his like are but a mote, and whosoever is with him in his vain imaginings. Put thy trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Verily He is with His sincere servants and His near ones who are brought nigh.

We have manifested Our Self and summoned all unto the Dayspring of Revelation Who speaks forth in the nights and days that there is none other God but Me, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.

How many a learned one awaited My days and how many a mystic bowed before My Name, yet when I manifested My Self they turned away until they pronounced their verdict against the Mighty, the All-Loving. Thus have We opened before thy face the gate of utterance with the key of His Name, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The scratching of the Most Exalted Pen is raised to such a degree that the tongues of the world and the pens of nations are powerless to make mention of it. Blessed is the ear that hath gained the honor of hearing His call and blessed is the tongue that hath been moved to make mention of Him. The whole world speaketh His Name yet is veiled from Him, turneth toward His countenance yet is debarred from Him, maketh mention of His Name yet is heedless of His Command. This is the Most Great Talisman. God willing, thou shouldst, with the utmost wisdom and utterance, guide those who thirst in the wilderness of heedlessness to the heavenly springs of divine revelation and summon them. Upon thee be wisdom, upon thee be wisdom. People are observed to be as infants - they need an educator and one who will remind them. Blessed is the soul that ariseth for the sake of God to serve the Cause, that perchance those who slumber may be awakened by this sweet spiritual breeze that wafteth at the dawn of this divine Day, and become aware. We convey Our greetings to all who have turned towards Us and enjoin upon them that which is befitting and meet. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted, and woe unto the heedless.

And We make mention of My handmaiden who hath ascended unto God. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Upon her be the glory of those who are on earth and in heaven, and the glory of them who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. O My handmaiden! Rejoice in what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, when the Wronged One was in a manifest prison. The glory that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty and My mercy be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who hath attained unto this mighty announcement. Praise be to God! Thou and the others have all attained unto the mark of the Most Exalted Pen. Convey My greetings to thy kindred. Verily We make mention of them through My loving-kindness, and We remind them of My verses, and We give them glad-tidings of My bounty, and We command them to observe justice and benevolence and the fear of God, the Lord of the worlds. The multiple visitations performed on behalf of the friends of God were all acceptable in the presence of the Wronged One and adorned with the ornament of His remembrance. The glory be upon thee and upon them from the presence of One All-Bountiful, All-Generous. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me to know Thee and guided me and caused me to hear. I beseech Thee by Thy Tablet and Thine ink, and by the love of Thy chosen ones, and by the enkindlement of the hearts of Thy sincere ones, and by the patience of the Dawning-Places of Thy dignity, to make me in all circumstances steadfast in Thy service and circling round Thy will. Thou art He Whom the opposition of every oppressor deterreth not, nor the derision of any transgressor, nor the objections of those who have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament and have disbelieved in Thy most great signs when sent down from the heaven of Thy will. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be My peace and My glory and My mercy and My loving-kindness! When thou desirest to visit the land of Ya and beholdest the darkness and light of that city, pause, facing towards it, and say: The resplendent Light shining from the horizon of God’s mercy, and the perfumed Spirit made manifest by the command of God, Lord of all beings, be upon you, O company of martyrs and dawning-places of submission in the realm of creation and sources of resignation before the faces of the enemies. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you! I testify that ye have attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain, and have spent whatsoever ye possessed of wealth and souls and bodies and beings. I testify that through your detachment the sun of detachment hath shone forth from the horizon of creation, and through your God-fearingness the light of piety hath beamed forth amidst all beings. Ye are they through whose submissiveness necks have bowed down, and through the lights of whose countenances the horizons have been illumined, and through whose steadfastness its decree hath appeared throughout the land among the servants. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you, unto your first and your last, your outward and your inward, and the mercy of God and His grace and the loving-kindness of God and His glory. Through you the lights of unity have appeared and the mysteries of detachment have emerged and all things have proclaimed: By God, the Day hath come and that which was treasured in knowledge and concealed within the pavilion of God’s protection, Lord of the mighty throne, hath appeared. And I testify that ye answered your Lord when His call was raised, and turned towards Him when He appeared with His sovereignty prevailing over all who are in the heavens and earths. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Single, the One. We have sent down for those who were martyred in the path of God that whereby the tears of those near unto God have fallen and the sighs of the sincere ones have ascended - they whom the doubts of the world deterred not, neither did the clamor of the nations who denied God’s proof and His evidence and disbelieved in the Day of Judgment frighten them. The kingdom and the dominion belong unto God, the Lord of this noble station. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon thy wife. Give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy and that which hath been sent down for her from the heaven of My grace, which hath encompassed existence both seen and unseen.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Ibrahim! May the glory of God rest upon thee - He Who answereth in all conditions.</p>
<p>O Muhammad before Ibrahim! God willing, mayest thou be blessed with divine grace. The entire world is thunderstruck by this most exalted Word and its like. The Unseen, clothed in the garment of manifestation, speaketh and saith: The Promise hath come and He Who was promised hath appeared with such sovereignty as the hosts of tyrants and the clamor of Pharaohs have failed to deter. He calleth out with the most exalted call between earth and heaven, summoning all who dwell in the realm of creation to the supreme horizon. Blessed is he who hath ears to hear, who hath a heart and hath turned toward it, and who hath a face and hath turned it toward God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Blessed are they whom the oppression of the oppressors and the might of the heedless have not kept back from God, exalted be His glory. In the sight of the All-Seeing, the entire world and all that is therein cannot equal a single one of God’s names, for the former is transient while the latter endureth. Although all people themselves testify to its transience, they cling to it in such wise that it hath become the cause of their heedlessness, error and waywardness.</p>
<p>One must stand firm in the Cause of the Lord of eternity with such steadfastness that no wavering can affect it. In all conditions speak with wisdom, for verily We have enjoined this upon all in My perspicuous Book. His honor Abu’l-Hasan - My glory be upon him - hath made mention of thee, and this clear tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of the mercy of the Lord of the worlds that thou mayest attain supreme joy. Praise and thanksgiving in all conditions! All souls, whether women or men, who have turned to the Truth have been mentioned, and each hath been honored with the remembrance of the Wronged One. Convey My greetings to all of them and gladden them with God’s grace. Time and again hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks to God for this great bounty. Thou art he who purposed, turned toward God, migrated and returned by His command, and the reward of attaining His presence hath been ordained for thee. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Glory be upon thee and upon them, men and women alike, from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

The Divine Day calleth out by itself and summoneth those on earth to the most exalted horizon. This Day in one station is a brilliant light that guideth those near unto God to the straight path and bestoweth awareness of the momentous announcement. O Vav! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. At this time one of My Branches, who was named Diya’ in the Crimson Book, was present and We made mention of thee with verses that have encompassed those in the heavens and on earth. And in another station this Day is the Water of Life for all who dwell in the realm of possibility. It is the true Salsabil and the spiritual Kawthar. From the hand of bounty It bestoweth upon the thirsty that which is the cause of everlasting life. Say: Well is it with them that drink! O Ra! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. The whole world hath been created for the recognition of this blessed Day, and yet most of the people of the world are deprived, save whom God, thy Lord, willeth. And in one station It possesseth the Book of the world and with It are the secrets of all peoples. At one time thou seest It seated upon the throne of utterance, teaching the people that which draweth them nigh, causeth them to know, and profiteth them. At another time thou beholdest It interpreting for all the different groups. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken at this blessed and manifest time. And were the mysteries of this Day to be mentioned, thou wouldst see all rendered unconscious save a few. O Varqa! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. Praise be to God that thou didst attain and act upon that which was imparted in the presence. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath heard thy call concerning the Cause of thy Lord. Time and again in these days hast thou been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to assist thee to conquer hearts through the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. O thou who art dear at the Throne! Thou art mentioned and hast attained unto grace. O Spirit of God! Give thanks unto God for having assisted thee, granted thee success, brought thee into His presence, and caused thee to hear His sweetest call from His most exalted horizon.

The inhabitants of the realms of My eternity, the dwellers of the cities of My immortality, and the companions of the depths of My grandeur yearn to meet this servant, and around him circle the Houris of the chambers of My paradise and the chaste maidens of My garden of paradise and good-pleasure. Thus hath the matter been ordained in the tablets of My Will, the volumes of My Purpose, the pages of My Decree, the books of My Judgment, the tablets of My Permission, and the leaves of My firm and impregnable Wisdom. Blessed art thou, O servant, in that these verses have been sent down unto thee, verses by which the hearts of My chosen ones and the souls of My trusted ones have been drawn. Give thanks unto thy Lord, then recite them that thy self, thy spirit and thine essence may be drawn by them, and that thou mayest be numbered among God’s successful servants. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon those who have heard the melodies of God in these days and were among the successful ones. And praise be to the Beloved of the mystics. O youth! Accept thou what God, thy Lord, hath decreed, then detach thyself from the idolaters. Say: This is what hath been decreed by our Lord; we are indeed of those who are certain.

Verily He is the Lord of humanity and the Sovereign of the throne and earth.” Greetings from the Wronged One be upon him and upon his son Husayn and upon those with him, female and male, young and old.</p>
<p>As for what your honor mentioned regarding the matter of trade with the spiritual friend Ahmad, upon him be Baha’u’llah, his mother, upon her be Baha’u’llah, does not wish him to travel there as she became grieved when she heard the climate does not agree with him. Today when your honor’s letter was read, it was sent to his honored father, upon him be Baha’u’llah, the Ancient Lord, that he might read it and inform your honor of their opinion. And regarding what you mentioned about Jasim, upon him be God’s peace, his eminence the honored Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Baha, mentioned the details. The servant asks his Lord to make known to all what is best for them and guide them to what benefits them. Verily His path is the straight path and His way is the clear and upright way. Glory and praise be upon your honor and those who bring joy to the eyes and those with you.</p>

<p>My God, my God! Nearness to Thee is my hope, Thy forgiveness my aim, Thy good pleasure my desire, and Thy pardon the ultimate object of my aspiration. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, by the manifestations of Thy power, by the revelations of Thine omnipotence, and by the Word through which Thou didst raise up the standard of Thy oneness amongst Thy servants and unfurl the banner of Thy remembrance throughout Thy lands, to assist this servant to act in accordance with what Thou hast commanded in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou seest me enkindled with the fire of separation from Thy loved ones. By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of the world and He Who hath appeared through the Most Great Name! I desire none other than Thee and love none but Thee. I implore Thee not to leave me to myself. Aid me, under all conditions, to remember and praise Thee. O my Lord! Thou beholdest the thirsty one advancing toward the ocean of Thy grace, the poor one awaiting Thy bounty and benevolence, and the sick one yearning for the fountain of Thy healing. I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Messengers, and by Him through Whom the breezes of Thy Revelation were cut off, to ordain for me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. Then cause me, O my God, to be among those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward Thy most exalted horizon. Thou seest me, O my God, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and holding fast to the hem of Thy generosity and favors. Thou seest my tears and hearest the sighs of my heart. Through Thy grace and favor, ordain for me that which will calm my agitation. Strengthen, O my God, mine eyes to behold the countenances of Thy chosen ones and loved ones, and illumine the vision of my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. Thou art He Who hath, by Thy power, borne witness to all created things, and by Thy grandeur to all existence. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. Bless, O God, O Thou Goal of the world and Beloved of the nations, through the dawning-places of Thy knowledge, the daysprings of Thy power, the manifestations of Thy Self, and the source of Thy recognition. I beseech Thee by them to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon Thy loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, remind them of Thy verses, and aid them in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art God. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

<p>O Nayriz! Unto him who loveth God. Hearken unto My Voice from the right hand of the Throne - the Spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of His Revelation, the Rising-point of His Inspiration, and the Manifestation of the lights of His resplendent Countenance. By My life! If the Seat of the Throne were to be in prison, verily it would be the Spot wherein every atom proclaimeth: “The Beloved of the worlds hath come!” Say: Through it God hath transformed the prison, making it a plot of Paradise, wherefrom waft the breezes of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: Through tribulation hath the Beauty derived comfort even as the Beloved findeth solace in the remembrance of His loved one, the Wondrous, the Peerless. Would that the body of the Beauty were crucified upon every tree in the path of God, the Sovereign Lord of all names! By My life! The more intense groweth the sorrow, the more doth the Ancient Beauty engage in the remembrance of God, the Creator of the nations. Yet the people are wrapped in a mighty veil. He hath built up the world for Myself and My loved ones, even though they dwell in the most desolate of lands for the sake of their Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. It behooveth thee in such days as these to arise to aid thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And when the Tablet of the Youth appeareth before thee, take it with the hand of certitude, then enter the gathering-place of the idolaters among the people of the Bayan and say: “O people! I have come unto you from the Dawning-place of the Cause of your Lord, the All-Merciful, with a manifest proof. Have ye occupied yourselves with idle fancies while the Sovereign of certitude standeth before your faces? What aileth you, O heedless people! Do ye imagine that what ye possess sufficeth you, or that it can equal even a single letter of that which hath proceeded from the Dayspring of the Will of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful? Nay, by Him Who hath taught the Pen the mysteries of eternity! A single letter thereof transcendeth all the books of the heavens and of the earth. Efface what hath proceeded from your pens, for the Supreme Pen speaketh betwixt earth and heaven, that haply ye may be attracted by that which descendeth from One mighty and wise.” Stand thou firm in My Cause in such wise that should all who are on earth rise up against thee, thou wouldst regard them as a handful of dust. Thus doth thy Lord teach thee from this remote station. And glory be upon thee and upon him who hath turned unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised.</p>

<p>This tablet was revealed for Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali who was known for his love of God in the land of Ta. He is the Ever-Abiding, the Ancient of Days. Hearken, O servant, unto that which is revealed unto thee from the holy precincts, and turn not unto those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Let thy Lord suffice thee, then detach thyself from all the worlds. Verily He will guard thee from the darts of Satan and draw thee nigh unto the holy and praiseworthy shore. Remember thyself at all times lest allusions veil thee, and thus doth command thee the Pen of the divine decree from this Finger which hath emerged from the Vesture of Power with manifest sovereignty. Unite with the loved ones of God and be thou a helper of His Cause, and neglect it not for less than a moment. We have indeed sent thee aforetime a tablet, and before it another tablet, then this leaf which God hath made to be witnessed from the holy Branch. And when it reacheth thee, receive it with spirit and fragrance, then recite it with wondrous and glorious melodies. Verily it is My garment which We have sent unto thee that thou mayest find from it the sweet-scented savors of a beloved glory. Arise to serve the Cause with wisdom from Us lest sedition be stirred up and harm return to the root of the Tree. Thus hast thou been commanded from the presence of One mighty and wise. Take the cup of life from the fingers of the All-Merciful and turn not unto the manifestations of Satan in these days wherein he hath arisen with a new craftiness. By God! The dwellers of the heavens and earth were bewildered by his cunning, and God is witness unto this. Then remind from Us those servants who have believed in God and His signs, whom the whisperings of Satan have not kept back from the beauty of the All-Merciful, and who have remained steadfast in the Cause. And besides these, they have no standing with God - leave thou their mention, for their names are not remembered before thy Lord on this day. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thou mayest follow the command of thy Lord and take for thyself a path unto Him. We have indeed revealed a tablet for thy brother and sent it unto him that his eyes may be consoled thereby and that he may remain steadfast in the Cause.</p>

Verily the Sun desired to send unto thee a light from its lights in the form of the words of God and the fragrances of His verses which dominate all who are in the heavens and earths. Say: O concourse of earth! The Hour hath come and its signs, and that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen hath appeared in the Books of God, Lord of the worlds. Verily the Book calleth out in truth and summoneth all to the horizon of Revelation from God, Lord of the mighty Throne. The scratching of the Pen hath been raised up and the Lord of Eternity before the faces of the nations hath arisen and said: Fear God, O people! Follow not those who denied the proof of God and His evidence and disbelieved in His glorious and wondrous Day. Fear God and purify your hearts from the tales of old and from that which is with those who cast guidance behind their backs, clinging to tyranny and wickedness. Indeed they are among the most lost in a clear Book. O thou who gazest toward the horizon of the Cause! Hear the call and say: O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! Aid me in all conditions to hearken unto Thy call and to turn unto the lights of Thy countenance and to behold the manifestations of the Sun of Thy Revelation. O my Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having manifested unto me Thy mighty Cause and Thy great announcement and for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of knowledge from the hands of Thy grace and bounty on a day wherein most of Thy servants and creatures were deprived therefrom. O my Lord! Enable Thy servants to turn unto the Tree and its fruits, and the Sun and its lights, and the Sea and its waves. By Thy glory, O Thou Goal of the world and Educator of the nations! This servant desireth to arise to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy servants. Strengthen him with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy most exalted horizon and holding fast to Thy Most Firm Handle. Ordain for me from the Pen of Thy decree that which will profit me in every world of Thy worlds and make me to be of those whom the vicissitudes and conditions of the world have not prevented.

<p>O Abu-Talib! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord from the direction of immortality, then listen to what is revealed unto thee from this Most Glorious Sacred Tree, that thou mayest be steadfast within thyself. Follow the religion of the Spirit in My Cause and turn not unto those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Then follow what is sent down unto thee from the Pen of thy Lord. Know thou that thy father fulfilled his covenant and broke not God’s testament, and followed this Beauty Whom none among creation hath known - to this doth the tongue of thy Lord bear witness. He ascended unto a station which no mystic can ever know and which no eloquent one can ever attain. Thus did We ordain for him in the Book of thy Lord. We raised him to this station because he showed no pride when the Sun of Sanctification dawned from the horizon of this Garment which the idolaters had stained crimson with the blood of hatred. Thus do We relate unto thee from the stories of thy Lord. When the Beauty of God shone upon him from the horizon of this Countenance, he fell prostrate upon the dust and tarried not for less than a moment. Thus did the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, precede him, as a grace from the wonders of thy Lord’s bounty. If thou desirest to soar in this atmosphere wherein the wings of the birds of the divine cloud-realm have never stirred, sanctify thyself from all else save God, thy Lord, that thou mayest be enabled to fly in this Paradise and become acquainted with the mysteries of what was and what shall be, before his gaze returneth unto the handiwork of thy Lord. Thus have We related unto thee the story of Paradise, lest thou render thyself deprived thereof and of the breezes of the All-Merciful, and that perchance thou mayest seek it within thyself and be of those who have sought the House of thy Lord. However, We are content with thy heart’s intention rather than physical presence, for in that lieth temptation which none knoweth save the Self of thy Lord. Thus have We bestowed upon thee and distinguished thee among Our servants, and We have sent unto thee this Garment that thou mayest find therein the fragrance of thy Lord.</p>

Verily the world shall pass away, and what endureth is that which hath been ordained by One mighty and powerful. If He so willeth, He can make all that is on earth endure through a word from His presence, and if He so desireth, He can make it perish through another word, for verily He hath encompassed all things. He who possesseth the vision of steel perceiveth in the Word of God that which he heard from the angel named Israfil, for through it the breezes of life blow upon the bodies of those who have turned with radiant faces toward God. Likewise doth he witness what he heard from the angel named ’Azra’il, for through God’s Word are the souls of the idolaters seized, and thus hath the matter been decreed in a preserved tablet.

Be thou steadfast in the love of God, then let His remembrance suffice thee in place of the remembrance of all the worlds.

Hear the call of the Beloved in these days when He was cast into the well of hatred by the hands of the oppressors. And He, from the depths of the well, calls out saying: O people! Forget not the days in which the Beauty of God shone upon you and His tongue spoke unto you from the holy, mighty, powerful and wise verses of God. And He walked among you yet none recognized Him save His own all-knowing, all-informed Self. And there appeared from Him the signs of God and His grandeur, then the sovereignty of God and His power, but none was aware of this save God, your Lord and the Lord of all creation. And you, O servant, remember My days and what you heard from My tongue, and forget not My favor upon you, for My favor upon you has indeed been great. Then remember My tribulations which have befallen Me in this remote prison. Beware, beware lest you become occupied with the world and its ornaments. Then purify yourself from all that prevents you from God, your Lord. This is My counsel unto you and unto Our believing servants. Say: O people! Fear God and commit not that which would cause God’s Cause to be lost among His servants, even though His Cause is sanctified above the defilement of the guilty ones. And if harm befalls you, be patient, then show forth yet more patience, then remember My harm. And if sorrow comes upon you, be patient, then reflect on the sorrows that have befallen the Beauty of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And when you are settled in a place and find rest within yourself, then weep for My tribulations among the company of the polytheists. And if you find comfort with anyone, then remember My loneliness in this land from which the feet of seekers are cut off. Thus have We remembered you and commanded you that you may remain steadfast in the Cause of your Lord and remember Him morning and evening. And the glory be upon you and upon those who have believed in God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

Thus was the matter decreed and judgement came from thy Lord, the One Who oversees what is and what shall be.

Wisdom has been enjoined upon all souls in the Book of God, that all may walk with perfect wisdom among the servants. Corruption, conflict and inflammatory matters are forbidden and unloved. And if a soul arises to fulfill that which God has commanded, and no contrary deed appears from him, then if he becomes the target of the oppression of tyrants and the transgression of the rebellious, there is no doubt that this oppression and these trials have befallen him in the path of God. What station have they considered greater than this station, and what glory have they reckoned higher than this glory? Every soul shall taste of the cup of death, and if this occurs for the sake of God and his spirit and body are sacrificed in the path of the Beloved, surely this is most fitting, and every person of insight bears witness that this station is the most exalted of stations in the sight of God. God willing, all must act according to that which God has commanded them, and be content and thankful for whatever may befall them. Say: O friends! Know your own worth. Soon shall all tongues make mention of you and all existence turn towards you. Verily He exalteth His Cause as He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful.

For at every moment those possessed of insight witness the signs of evanescence, setting and decline. Yet all remain heedless. By the life of God, the people are in manifest loss! Give thanks to the Goal of all the worlds that thou hast been mentioned in the Most Great Prison before the Wronged One and hast attained unto this mighty Tablet. Though the value of the divine Word is not known to the heedless at present, ere long its worth shall become evident and its station manifest to all the world. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto a single letter of the Book and acteth according to what is revealed therein. This is the Day for pure deeds. God willing, the friends of Truth must appear among the servants with perfect trustworthiness, truthfulness and praiseworthy character. They are as lamps amid the darkness of the age. We counsel thee and the friends of God with two words, and for the sake of God remind you: First, steadfastness in the Cause, for great indeed is its importance, as mentioned in the divine Books. Second, to act in accordance with what befitteth these days. God willing, mayest thou acquire an eternal station in this transient world and attain unto that which is intended. Give thanks unto God for this mighty favor and say: Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>Visitation Tablet for His Holiness Nasir, upon him be the Glory of God and His Light</p>
<p>In My Name, the Compassionate, the Bountiful Visitor</p>
<p>The first remembrance that dawned from the horizon of the Mother Book and the first light that shone from the horizon of the Face in the final return - upon thee, O thou who hast turned to God, the Lord of Lords!</p>
<p>I testify that thou didst acknowledge what the Tongue of Eternity acknowledged and didst witness what the Lord of the world and Goal of the nations witnessed. Thou art he through whom and through whose like the fortress of the Cause was strengthened among the servants and the mention of the Desired One was raised throughout the lands. Thou art he whom neither the clamor of the divines prevented from the Lord of all beings nor the power of princes from the Most Exalted Horizon. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified to thy testimony in the path of God, Creator of heaven, and to thy steadfastness until thy spirit ascended to the Most Glorious Companion.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Nasir, for having heard and responded and believed and turned until thou didst enter and attain presence and didst hear what the Son of Imran heard on the Mount of Knowledge and didst see what the Beloved saw of the signs of his Lord, the All-Merciful. I testify that thou didst attain the lights of reunion and didst drink the choice wine of nearness and meeting from the hands of thy Lord’s bounty in the beginning and the return.</p>
<p>Thou art he who was patient in hardship and tribulation, and the people of the cities of justice and fairness lamented at what befell thee and thy like from oppression. By your calamities the sky was filled with smoke and grief took hold of the Dawning-places of Revelation and the Day-springs of Knowledge. Blessed are ye and those who seek your station and visit your dust and remember your days and what befell you and draw near through you to God, your Lord and your Goal and your Object of Worship and the Object of Worship of all in the heavens and earths.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by those who were martyred in Thy path and soared in the atmosphere of Thy love in such wise that the power of the world could not hold them back from the Most Great Name, that Thou forgive me and my father and my mother and whosoever hath held fast unto Thy Strong Cord, O God of the worlds!</p>

<p>O Mr.&nbsp;M.Sh! In the name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. The divine utterances are expressed in the Persian tongue. Although Arabic is more excellent, yet Persian speech is sweeter. In all conditions, fix your gaze upon this blessed word which, like the Most Great Luminary, hath dawned from the horizon of the divine Tablet. He saith: “Whoso belongeth to God, God belongeth to him.” This servant beareth witness to that which hath been mentioned. Hold fast unto it, for it sufficeth thee if thou act according to it. He, verily, is the All-Knowing Teacher. Reflect a little: the whole world hath been created for the knowledge of God. In all the heavenly Books, they were given the glad-tidings of the Most Great Manifestation. Nevertheless, when the veils were rent asunder, and the clouds were lifted, and the Countenance of the Intended One appeared and was made manifest from the horizon of the heaven of revelation, all arose in opposition and protest, though all were expectant. This is why He formerly said that true believers are rarer than red sulphur. Had they reflected even less than that on what was revealed before, they would not have been deprived today of the ocean of meanings and prevented from the sun of clear vision. Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, and in the end of life hold fast unto that which is better for thee than all the treasures of the world. By the ocean of knowledge! What is being said is the truth, there is no doubt in it. Hear thou My call and say “God!” then leave them to their vain disputes. If thou shouldst find even less than a needle’s eye of the fragrances of the utterance of the All-Merciful, thou wouldst find thyself detached from the world and all who dwell therein, and wouldst take up thy habitation and find thy refuge in the shadow of the Friend in the utmost joy and delight and tranquility. A prayer was sent before; persevere in it, for it is a key to the gates of divine favor and mercy and kindness. Blessed is he who holdeth fast to the cord of the Command and cleaveth to the hem of the grace of his Lord, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted! These are the verses of God, the King, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, sent down from the heaven of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath turned unto them and detached himself from those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Say: O people! The Day which ye were promised in the Tablets hath come. Fear ye God and be not of the heedless. This is the Day whereon the Herald calleth out from the right hand of the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great!” Blessed is he who hath heard His call and turned with a luminous countenance unto His face. Say: O people! Do ye doubt Him or that which hath appeared from His presence with a manifest sovereignty? Alas for those who have disbelieved in God after He came with the truth with clear authority. Say: O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and oppose not Him Who hath sacrificed His soul in the path of God, the King, the Most High, the Most Praiseworthy. Verily, He Who built up the world for Himself now dwelleth in the most desolate of lands through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought. And He Who desired to give the world to drink of the wine of remembrance of their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, hath been denied the water which even birds and beasts do drink. Woe unto those who have disbelieved in Him for Whom they were created! Soon shall the breezes of chastisement seize them from every direction and they shall find themselves in manifest loss. Say: The trials that have befallen Baha have not prevented Him from calling all who are in the worlds at all times unto God, their Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus hath it been ordained by One mighty and powerful. O servant! Make mention of thy Lord amongst His servants that perchance there may be stirred within their hearts that which shall draw them nigh unto the kingdom of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless. There hath been ordained for whomsoever hath desired his Lord in these days that which the pens are powerless to record, and thy Lord, the All-Knowing, beareth witness unto what I say. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who, when they heard the call from the Dayspring of grandeur, said: “We believe in God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.” They are indeed among the sincere ones. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, by the Essence which hath appeared in the garment of the Most Glorious - these are the verses of God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting, sent down in truth for people who understand. And God addresseth therein all who are in the heavens and on earth, and all that hath been and shall be, saying: “There is no God but I, Who created all contingent things from nothing through My Will, and brought all beings into existence from naught through My Purpose. I am the One with power over whatsoever I desire, and I am the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting. Follow, O people, Him Who hath appeared with all the signs, around Whom circle the realities of the Prophets, then the spirits of the chosen ones, then those who dwell behind the pavilions of the Command.” And thou, O servant, remember the time when thou didst enter the Spot of God, the All-Encompassing, the Mighty, the Beloved, and didst attain the presence of the Countenance, and We caused the sun of Beauty to shine upon thy face from the horizon of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Witnessed. Thou didst hear what no ear of creation hath heard and didst see what no eye of contingent beings hath seen. Thus did the grace of thy Lord encompass thee that thou mightest be of those who remember through the remembrance of God, the Most Great. By God, this is He, could ye but know it. Turn thy face toward God and leave those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. When they witnessed with their own eyes the sovereignty and power of God, they desired to slay Him. When God prevented them from what they desired, they then rose up in calumny and attributed to the Ancient Beauty that which befitteth their own station. Thus do We impart unto thee that thou mayest be of those who know. And thou, remain firm in the Cause of God and steadfast upon this Path which hath been raised up in truth, and follow not every rejected polytheist. Verily those who command people to associate partners with God are of the hosts of Satan, were ye of those who understand. Shun, O people, such as these and turn toward the right-hand corner of this Throne whereon is seated the Beauty of God, the All-Encompassing, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. And glory be upon thee and upon whoso turneth toward God with befitting humility.</p>

These are verses which have now been sent down in truth from the heaven of mighty splendor, and in all things they speak forth: Open thine eyes! By God, that which the Ancient Being had yearned to encounter, to behold His beauty, and to hear His melodies, hath appeared - yet the people have not understood and remain veiled from Him.</p>
<p>O Sadiq! Hearken thou unto My call at this moment in the Supreme Horizon, then give thanks to thy Lord that We have remembered thee in this Tablet and have raised thee up in truth among the Concourse on High in the form of a well-proportioned human temple. Blessed art thou for having believed in that whereunto thou wert called. When We manifested Our Self amongst the servants, We found not among them one who was truthful, for had there been truthfulness in them, they would not have remained veiled from this Beauty Who hath appeared from every manifestation and hath shone forth from the horizon of the Spirit with evident sovereignty. Verily, truthfulness can only be realized through the recognition by the servant of his Creator at the time of His appearance, and thus hath the matter been recorded in truth in all the Tablets. He who hath not attained unto His beauty hath never been truthful, even should he be deemed truthful among the people or be known for truthfulness among all creation.</p>
<p>O spirit! Joy be unto thee for having believed in the Cause of thy Lord, for having recognized Him and borne witness in His path, for having been attracted by the breezes of rapture from the direction of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and for having been drawn by the breaths of the Spirit to a station that was in truth exalted. Now doth the Pen of God make mention of those servants whom God hath related unto thee, that their eyes may be solaced thereby and they may remember God in their hearts and thank Him with a truthful and trustworthy tongue. And thou, O servant, take thou the cup of life in the Ridvan of the All-Merciful from the fingers of those whose faces God hath honored by turning away from aught else but Him, and whom He hath raised up in truth from the essence of the Spirit by the hands of divine Will. Glory be upon thee and upon those whom God hath related unto thee, and upon those who associated with thee in this world with pure love for the sake of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Creator of the World!</p>
<p>All the peoples of the world have been created to know God, exalted be His glory and sovereignty, and all have been promised the Day of His Manifestation. Yet when the Sun of Knowledge rose from the horizon of revelation and the Sea of Utterance surged with its waves, all were found heedless and veiled from Him, save those souls who broke the chains of vain imaginings through the Name of God. These are they who drank from the pure fountain of certitude and, passing beyond the realm of words and suppositions, attained unto the ocean of inner meanings. Reflect upon former ages: whenever the Dawning-Places of divine inspiration appeared on earth, the heedless souls arose in opposition and protest, and most were martyred by the swords of hatred and animosity. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers! Those who denied, associated partners with God, remained heedless and acted unjustly have indeed lost, while those who were martyred in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds, have truly prospered.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist that soul, that in this Day which is illumined by the lights of the Kingdom of knowledge, they may attain to that which the transcendent Truth has willed, and not be deprived of the dawning rays of divine grace. The evanescence of the world is evident to all and needs no mention. Therefore one must seek a station that is sanctified from suppositions and vain imaginings and exalted above all conditions and colors.</p>
<p>Say: O God of the worlds and Sovereign of the nations! I beseech Thee, by the eternity of Thy Being and the everlastingness of Thine Essence, to assist me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon and Thy most resplendent station. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and speaking Thy praise. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy service and detached from all else but Thee. Then ordain for me, O my God, that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have attained unto the recognition of the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Manifestation of Thy clear tokens. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O Ahmad, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of the Beloved of all worlds!</p>
<p>We have enjoined wisdom upon all and forbidden that which causeth souls to be perturbed. Therefore it is incumbent upon all to act in accordance with what the Intended One hath commanded. The verses have been sent down, the evidences are manifest, the proofs are resplendent, and the bounty is complete, and yet most people are observed to be heedless and veiled. This is naught but the result of negligence, vain imaginings and idle fancies. Therefore it is obligatory and binding upon the loved ones of God who are adorned with the distinction of His grace to enkindle those who are cold with the fire of divine wisdom. After recognition of the Dawning-Place of Revelation, two things are necessary: first, steadfastness, and second, observance of the divine ordinances that have been sent down in the Book. Blessed are they that have attained! The manner and method of teaching have been revealed in the Tablets - all must act accordingly and be watchful. Today that which hath caused the perturbation and agitation of heedless souls hath been forbidden. This is of thy Lord’s grace, yet most people are unaware. Ye must arise to serve His Cause with the power and might of God, and with the utmost kindliness draw people from the wilderness of perplexity to the realm of knowledge and certitude. And if means become available, emigrate to other lands for the sake of God’s Cause - this hath been and ever shall be praiseworthy, for in some countries there exist receptive souls, yet guides and teachers are lacking. He, verily, is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. Drink ye, now and forever, from the wine of His favors and share it with others, that perchance the people may awaken and turn unto the All-Informed, the One. Convey to all the loved ones the greetings from the Wronged One, and forbid them all from corruption, contention, reprehensible deeds and unacceptable conduct, that the fragrance of sanctity may be diffused from all. Praise be to God, all have attained unto the remembrance of God and are honored by His grace. Glory be upon thee and upon you all.</p>

<p>HE IS THE MOST GREAT</p>
<p>Listen! From the horizon of the Ancient Tongue it was revealed to the Pen: “Write upon the Tablet: ‘Verily I am God, there is no God but Me, the Most Great, the Most Great.’” The Pen swooned from the sweetness of the Word of God, the Most High. When it recovered, it declared: “Verily, I am the first of the worshippers.” This is a Word at which spirits have swooned, stars have fallen, and all upon the earth have been seized by the might of thy Lord, the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Verily, the heavens are folded up by His command and the verses are sent down by His sovereignty. Glorified be He above what every doubtful polytheist imagines! Say: Can tribulation prevent the Glory from that which He is commanded? No, by the Lord of Names! From His horizon He speaks the truth and summons the people to the Mighty, the Bestower. Is there doubt about God? Say: Die in your wrath! He is the Most Great Proof and these are the evidences. Verily tribulation is the water of heaven which God hath sent down from the clouds that there might grow from it the ears of corn in the hearts of those who, when they hear “Unto whom belongeth the Kingdom?” say “Unto God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.” And by it God distinguisheth between His servants. Verily, there is no God but He. He guideth whom He willeth to the straight path. Then know that thy Lord hath seized him who pronounced judgment against Us. Soon shall there join him a people whom We have left in the valley of desires. Verily thy Lord is mighty in His grasp and severe in His punishment. Then We seized him whom We had promised chastisement in the Scriptures and Tablets. When the agony of death overtook him, he said: “Is there any protector?” It was said: “There is no protector for thee this day.” The angels of wrath cast him face down into the fire. It was said: “This is what was promised thee by God, the Protector, the Powerful, the Subduer.” And those whom We have left - this is due to a wisdom which none knoweth save God and those who possess knowledge of the Book. Arise to aid thy Lord, then remind the people before the punishment cometh upon them. We have sent thee aforetime that which hath diffused the fragrance of the garment throughout all regions. Glorify thy Lord with praise and say: “O my Lord! Protect me beneath the pavilion of Thy majesty and deprive me not of what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the earth and the heavens.”</p>

Thy mention hath been made before the Throne of the Lord of eternity in the Most Great Prison, and We have revealed for thee that which hath caused the hearts of the righteous to soar and the minds of the pure-hearted to be drawn forth. All the peoples of the world have awaited and still await the days of His manifestation, and in the nights and days they have beseeched and implored the Lord of all beings for His presence. Yet when the light of His manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the world, all turned away except whom God willed. Would that they had been content with that! Rather, they committed that which was as a sword cutting down the blessed Tree. This deed was the result of the decree of the ignorant ones - those souls who, though having attained the most exalted station in the name of truth, wrought that which hath caused the Supreme Pen to lament and wail for successive years. Thus did their own selves prompt them, while they perceived not and understood not.</p>
<p>Thou shouldst praise God for having aided thee to recognize Him and adorned thee with the ornament of acceptance in His days, and given thee to drink of the Kawthar of knowledge from the hand of His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Say: I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Great Name, to ordain for me that which shall make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause.

God makes mention of His servant at this hour in the Kingdom of Names and Attributes, that he may rejoice within himself at the most exalted station - a station which none among the Letters have attained save those who have believed in this Cause and have outstripped all created things in this Revelation, whereby all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation were thunderstruck, all in the heavens and earth were dismayed, and all beings were shaken except those whom God preserved from the surges of self and purified their hearts from all allusions. O Hasan! God makes mention of you at this hour, and before that which has no before, and after that which has no after, inasmuch as you ascended unto God your Lord and sacrificed your body and spirit in His path, and rose to the highest chambers. Glad tidings unto you, for the world prevented you not from entering into the depths of the mercy of your Lord - you entered therein and feared no one in the path of your Master. Thus does God single out whom He wishes through His grace. With Him is the revelation of verses - He sends them down upon whomsoever He wishes among His creation. Verily, there is none mighty save Him. His is the creation and the command, and none among contingent beings has preceded Him in His command. If all who are in the heavens and earth were to cling to the cord of any one of you who were martyred in God’s path and died in His way, God would surely remove from them the garment of rebellion and clothe them in the robes of mercy and forgiveness, and cause them to speak in the highest paradise with the most wondrous melodies. However, when their hearts hardened, they were veiled from this bounty which encompassed you and your kinfolk and those who loved you. Then, glory be upon you and upon those who were martyred and gave up their spirits in the path of God their Creator, and when the Sun of the horizons dawned from the holy dayspring, they fell prostrate upon their faces before God, the Lord of Names and Attributes.</p>

Thus hath the horizon of knowledge been illumined by the Sun of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, Who speaketh the truth: There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Remember on My behalf My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of My Book and My remembrance. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain imaginings and turned unto the Dawning-Place of Revelation on this Day which was promised in the Scriptures of God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest conjectures withhold you from the Dawning-Place of certitude, or the intimations of the opposers cause you to fear - they who have followed their desires and broken God’s Covenant and His Testament when He came with the Manifestation of His Cause, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken while seated upon the throne in His mighty prison. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God and the God of all existence, the Lord of the unseen and the seen! I beseech Thee by the Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Places of Thy Revelation, who have turned toward this Most Glorious Horizon, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones who hastened to the place of sacrifice, yearning for Thy Beauty and seeking reunion with Thee. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, clinging unto Thee, and holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy. Do with me as beseemeth Thee. Thou art He to Whose power and sovereignty all atoms bear witness, and to my poverty before the revelation of Thy riches. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>A mention from Us to one who has attained the lights of the Kingdom when he turned to the supreme horizon and heard the call of his Most Glorious Lord which was raised from this most splendid station, which hath been named by all names in the Books and Tablets, that he may discover the fragrance of the All-Merciful and turn with his heart unto God, the Lord of all religions. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before His face hath read it, and We have answered thee with this epistle which hath been detailed from the Mother Book. Blessed art thou for having found the sweetness of the Call and for having answered thy Lord when most of the servants turned away from Him. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s grace - verily He heareth and seeth and ordaineth for thee from His bounty whatsoever He willeth. He is, in truth, the One Who overshadoweth all who are in the earths and heavens.</p>
<p>God willing, thou shouldst remain steadfast in the Cause of God with such constancy that its fragrance may be diffused throughout the divine realms. I swear by the Sun of utterance which hath appeared from the horizon of God’s Tablet that a station hath been conferred upon you whose mention shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly realm endure. God willing, thou shouldst walk in the footsteps of the two Luminaries. The world and all that is therein are seen to be transient and perishable. Strive thou in that which shall endure for thee through the eternity of thy Lord’s names, the All-Knowing, the Ancient of Days. In all conditions be thou occupied with the remembrance of God and be thou attentive to the horizon of His Cause. This is what profiteth thee in this world and the next and exalteth thee amongst the people. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Convey to all the leaves My greetings from the Wronged One and say: The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified to your oppression, and this testimony is superior to all that hath been and shall be seen. Blessed is the soul that hath drawn nigh unto you for the sake of God. We testify that ye are under the sheltering gaze of your Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have mentioned both your young and old, and We make mention as a bounty from Our presence. He is, in truth, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Lo! He is among the triumphant. Blessed is he in that the Beauty of the Ancient of Days remembereth him in the Most Great Prison, that joy may possess him in the days of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, in such wise that no sadness shall overtake him in the Cause of his Lord, the All-Choosing.

God knoweth what hath befallen thee in His path. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He will surely recompense those who have been touched by tribulations in His love.

Rejoice thou in the Tablet of thy Lord and turn with thy heart unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

We beseech God to aid thee and him to serve His Cause with kindness. He, verily, is the Kind, the Merciful. When thou hast gained the Tablet of God and its effect, arise and say: “O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Wronged One, Who hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of lands, to make me detached unto Thee and steadfast in Thy love in such wise that should the idolaters cut me to pieces, I would not turn my gaze from the horizon of Thy Name, the Luminous.

Your mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and thy name hath been caused to flow from the Most Exalted Pen. Render thanks unto the Desired One of the world for this most great bounty and supreme gift. Observe and ponder, for an hour’s reflection is better than seventy years of pious worship. How many were the divines, mystics and doctors of the Shi’ih sect who, throughout the days and nights, occupied themselves with the remembrance of the Qa’im, beseeching God - glorified be His majesty - from pulpits and in mosques for His appearance, yearning to attain His presence. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of His countenance and the divine Lote-Tree sprouted forth by the leave of the Glorious Lord, all arose in the early years to oppose Him and issued the verdict for the shedding of His most pure blood. But thou, through divine grace and heavenly bounty, hast attained this most great favor and hast recognized the Great Announcement mentioned in God’s Book. Know thou the worth of this exalted station and preserve thyself through His Name. If thou truly ponderest upon that which hath been mentioned, thou shalt attain supreme joy. Convey My greetings to thy son and remind him of the divine verses, that perchance he may expend the gift of life in service at the court of verses and not allow transient ornaments to deprive him of enduring wealth. We likewise make mention of Baqir and remind him of wondrous and sublime verses. Convey greetings from the Wronged One. I beseech God to aid His loved ones to accomplish that which is befitting. And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad Ja’far, and We counsel him and My loved ones to observe justice and fairness and that whereby the glory of My party shall be made manifest amidst all parties. Thus hath the Treasury revealed its pearls, and the Ocean its waves, and the Light its effulgence. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>

<p>My remembrance is unto him who hath turned his face toward My countenance, drawn nigh unto Mine horizon, hearkened unto My call and answered his Lord when every heedless and remote one turned away. We have summoned all unto God, yet the people have turned aside and denied, save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, hath willed. How many a servant hath lamented in separation, yet when the Sun of reunion dawned from the horizon of manifestation, he denied God, the Single, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who hath inhaled My fragrance, and he whose eyes have beheld Mine horizon, and he whose tongue hath spoken My praise, and he who hath hastened unto the ocean of My knowledge, the Mighty, the Ancient. O thou who gazest upon the Face! We make mention of thee as a token of Our grace, and We make mention of those who hastened unto the choice wine of utterance in the days of the All-Merciful and were among the triumphant. Blessed is the soul that hath found the fragrance of My raiment, hath arisen to serve My Cause, and hath spoken My beauteous praise. We counsel all to manifest supreme steadfastness, and We beseech God to aid them in that which He desireth and to ordain for them through the Pen of Destiny that which befitteth His great sovereignty. Blessed is the rich man who hath become poor in the path of God, and the strong one whom weakness hath overtaken through what the hosts of the oppressors have wrought. Blessed is he who hath endured adversity and hardship out of love for God - My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness that he is among the sincere ones. Sorrow not for what hath befallen you. Rather, rejoice in this wise remembrance. He maketh mention of you in such wise as to spread the fragrance of the Beloved throughout the world. To this beareth witness My Most Great Name, which proclaimeth: There is none other God but He, the Single, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Thus hath the cock crowed and the Dove of the Cause hath warbled, yet most of the people are sunk in slumber. The glory rest upon thee, upon thy father who hath turned unto God, and upon thy brothers who have attained unto the recognition of God on a Day wherein all who are in the heavens and on earth were terrified, save those who came unto God with manifest radiance.

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy mercy in Thy days, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy oneness, and by Thy signs whereby the hearts of them that love Thee among Thy creatures were attracted, and by Thy manifestations whereby the faces of them that yearn for Thee were turned toward the court of Thy grace and bounty, to send down upon Thy handmaiden from the clouds of Thy decree and the heavens of Thy providence that which will sanctify her from all else except Thee and draw her nigh unto the seat of the throne of Thy mercy and the dawning-place of the lights of the Sun of Thy divinity.</p>
<p>O Lord! She hath turned toward Thee, and hath acknowledged Thy unity and confessed Thy singleness, and hath called upon Thee in her privacy and openly, and her call hath ascended to the heaven of Thy oneness and the dawning-place of Thy dominion and command. O Lord! Make her not deprived of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen handmaidens, and keep her not far from the sanctuary of Thy nearness and good-pleasure.</p>
<p>O Lord! Sprinkle upon her heart from the depths of the ocean of Thy remembrance that which will attract her unto Thee and cause her to speak of Thy praise and glorification among Thy handmaidens. Then inscribe upon the tablet of her heart with Thy Most Exalted Pen the verses of Thy love and the mysteries of Thy knowledge in such wise that the affairs and manifestations of the world shall not efface them.</p>
<p>O Lord! Write down for her that which is best for her and ordain for her that which will gladden her heart and rejoice her soul. Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful over whatsoever He willeth and shall ever remain as Thou hast been from time immemorial. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most High.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy Manifestation through Whom the Hour was thrown into commotion and the Resurrection took flight, and every intimate friend and confidant fell away, and through Whom darkness was illumined and the Word shone forth and the proof was perfected, to clothe her with the robe of forgiveness and purify her from transgression. Then enable her, O my God, to serve Thy servant whom Thou hast chosen for Thy love and named the Beauty. Verily, Thou art the Lord of grace and bounty, the Creator of earth and heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou seest how He Who is the Manifestation of Thy Name, the Unique, and the Dawning-Place of Thy glorious Book, spendeth the days of the Festival in the prison of Thine enemies, where they have prevented Him from going forth and Thy loved ones from entering. In such condition He calleth upon Thee, saying: “O my God! Grant Thy loved ones patience in their separation from Thee, then make them content with Thy good-pleasure and the manifestation of Thy decree.” Thou knowest, O my God, what hath befallen those of Thy servants who have turned toward Thee, after they sought the Ka’bih of Thy presence and the sanctuary of Thy nearness and reunion. Among them were servants who entered the city, turning toward the Spot which Thou hadst made the Qiblih of those in Thy heaven and earth, yet were prevented from beholding Thy beauty - those whom Thou didst name Abu’l-Hasan and Rasul, and another from the land of Alif and Ra. By their prevention, tears flowed from the eyes of the maidens in their chambers, and the hearts of the meanings were set aflame in the palaces of words. When Thou didst know, through Thy hidden knowledge, the fire of Thy love and longing for Thy beauty that was in their hearts, there came Thy binding command from the heaven of eternity, and there was revealed concerning them that which stirred the hearts of all created things with longing for the sweet savors of Thy revelation and yearning for the fragrances of Thy days. Thou didst decree for them the reward of those who attained Thy presence and appeared and beheld and heard that which shone forth and dawned and was sent down from Thy throne and Thy beauty and Thy verses, and Thou didst accept their deeds in such wise that mention thereof flowed from the Pen of Thy Revelation in numbered Tablets. I thank Thee, O my God, on their behalf, for what Thou hast granted them, O Lord of all names and attributes! Blessed is he who draweth nigh unto the lands wherein Thou dwellest. Blessed is he who turneth toward the heaven from whose horizon Thou dost shine forth. Blessed is he who visiteth the wall of the City from which Thy fragrances waft. Blessed is the soul that hath turned toward the land of Syria and wandered therein with longing for Thee. Blessed is he who is content with what Thou hast decreed for him. Blessed is he who hath been enabled to turn toward Thee, O Lord of grandeur and majesty! There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Single, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Thou beholdest my low estate and the habitation wherein I dwell, and bearest witness unto my perplexity, my crying needs, my troubles, and the afflictions I suffer among Thy servants who recite Thy verses and repudiate their Revealer, who call on Thy names and cavil at their Creator, who seek to draw nigh unto Him Who is Thy Friend and put to death Him who is the Best-Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>Open Thou their eyes, O my God, and My Master, that they may gaze on Thy beauty, or cause them to return unto the lowest abyss of the fire. Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest. Thou art, verily, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The glory of Thy might, O my God, beareth me witness! Every time I attempt to remember Thee, I find myself overpowered by the sublimity of Thy station and the immensity of Thy might; and every time I hold my peace, lo, I am impelled by my love for Thee and by the potency of Thy will, to unloose my tongue and mention Thee. He who is poor and needy, O my God, is calling for his Lord, the All-Possessing; and he who is destitute of all strength remembereth his Master, the All-Powerful. If He deign to accept His servant’s supplication, He is, verily, of unsurpassed bounteousness; and if He cast him out, He is of those who judge equitably the best. He indeed is acceptable, O my God, who hath set his face towards Thee, and he is truly deprived who hath been careless of the remembrance of Thee in Thy days. Blessed is he that hath tasted of the sweetness of Thy remembrance and praise. Nothing, not even the arising of all the peoples of the whole world to assail him, can hinder such a man from directing his steps towards the paths of Thy pleasure and the ways of Thy Cause.</p>
<p>Look, then, O Thou Who art the Well-Beloved of Baha, upon the tears he sheddeth before Thee, and behold the sighs which he uttereth, O Thou Who art his heart’s Desire! I swear by Thy might, and Thy majesty and Thy glory! Were I to inherit from Thee all the delights of Paradise, and to keep them in my possession as long as Thine own Being endureth, and were I to become, for less than a moment, careless of the remembrance of Thee, I would, of a certainty, cast them away from me and cease to consider them. I am the one, O my God, who for love of Thee hath forsaken the world and all its benefits, and willingly accepted every tribulation for the sake of Thy remembrance.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, O Thou Who art my Companion and my Best-Beloved, to lift the veil that hath come in between Thee and Thy servants, that they may recognize Thee with Thine own eye and rid themselves of all attachment to any one but Thee. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate. No God is there beside Thee, the Most Exalted, the Self-Sufficing, the Self-Exalting, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>He Who is called Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God. In the Name of the One God, the Peerless, the Eternal. Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou hearest the cries of Thy loved ones from every direction and their lamentations from all regions, and of those whom the idolaters have made captives in Thy path and for Thy good-pleasure. Thou knowest, O my God, that they have no sin except their love for Thee, and no transgression except their turning toward the court of Thy loving-kindness. Were the wrongdoers to be asked by what sin they have committed that which caused the denizens of the pavilions of the Kingdom to weep, they would be bewildered in their answer. All things bear witness that they were seized only for their love of Thee, and afflictions touched them only in Thy path. By this means did the idolaters desire to turn faces away from turning toward the countenance of Thy oneness, and to prevent the servants from beholding the horizon of Thy unity, that they might thereby extinguish the lamp of Thy oneness amongst Thy creation and quench the fire of Thy love in Thy dominion. Soon shall they witness and see how by their actions the lights of the lamp of Thy oneness have increased. Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having made my family and loved ones captives in Thy path, that thereby Thou mightest free the necks of Thy creatures; and Thou hast made them abased for the glory of Thy Cause, and sacrificed them for the life of the people of Thy earth. I beseech Thee, O my God, to make them steadfast in Thy love and good-pleasure. Then grant them what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones in the worlds of Thy sanctity. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O My Name! There hath befallen you in the path of God that which hath befallen no other among the servants, to such extent that the pen is powerless to recount it. But since it occurred in the love of God, it is sweeter to the taste of lovers than all the sweetness of the worlds. Convey My greetings and remembrance to My loved ones who have borne hardships in the path of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. We have sufficed with the mention of your tribulations rather than mentioning My tribulation, and whoever returns shall mention what he hath witnessed and seen, and shall inform you of Our condition. The doors have been closed upon Our faces, but God shall soon open them in truth, for He hath power over all things. And mercy be upon you from the presence of One mighty and wise.</p>

<p>Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou dost witness that Thy will hath prevailed over all created things, and Thy mercy hath surpassed all who are in heaven and on earth. And when Thou didst purpose to unveil Thy sovereignty, and to glorify Thy word, and to reveal Thy bounteousness and mercy, Thou didst raise up one of Thy servants, and didst choose Him above all Thy creatures, and didst single Him out for Thy purpose, and didst clothe Him with the robe of Thy guidance, and didst immerse Him beneath the seas of Thy majesty and grandeur, and didst sanctify Him from all that beseemeth not the greatness of Thy glory and the power of Thy might, and didst bid Him to cry out before all that are in heaven and on earth, and summon the multitudes to the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Revealer of Thy signs.</p>
<p>No sooner had He proclaimed Thy Cause, and risen up to carry out the things prescribed unto Him in the Tablets of Thy decree, than the Great Terror fell upon Thy creatures. Some turned towards Thee, and detached themselves from all except Thee, and sanctified their souls from the world and all that is therein, and were so enravished by the sweetness of Thy voice that they forsook all Thou hadst created in the kingdom of Thy creation. Others recognized Thee and then hesitated, others allowed the world to come in between them and Thee and to withhold them from recognizing Thee. Others disdained Thee, and turned back from Thee, and wished to prevent Thee from achieving Thy purpose. And yet behold how all of them are calling upon Thee, and are expecting the things they were promised in Thy Tablets. And when the Promised One came unto them, they recognized Him not, and disbelieved in Thy signs, and repudiated Thy clear tokens, and strayed so grievously from Thy path that they slew Thy servants, through the brightness of whose faces the countenances of the Concourse on high have been illumined.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names, to guard Thy loved ones against Thine enemies, and to strengthen them in their love for Thee and in fulfilling Thy pleasure. Do Thou protect them, that their footsteps may slip not, that their hearts may not be shut out as by a veil from Thee, and that their eyes may be restrained from beholding anything that is not of Thee. Cause them to be so enraptured by the sweetness of Thy divine melodies that they will rid themselves of all attachment to any one except Thee, and will turn wholly towards Thee, and extol Thee under all conditions, saying: “Praised be Thou, O Lord our God, inasmuch as Thou hast enabled us to recognize Thy most exalted and all-glorious Self. We will, by Thy mercy, cleave to Thee, and will detach ourselves from any one but Thee. We have realized that Thou art the Beloved of the worlds and the Creator of earth and heaven!”</p>

<p>O Muhammad Ja’far, He is the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted</p>
<p>The clouds of holiness have been raised up in truth in this heaven that towers above all contingent things, raining down upon all created things from the outpourings of an impregnable mercy. Through it there have sprouted forth from the breasts of the sincere the flowers of wisdom and utterance. Thus has the grace of the All-Merciful encompassed all the worlds. O servant! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, Who has fallen beneath the sword of the enemies and in this prison lies captive in the hands of the idolaters. By God! Those who were given the Furqan did not wrong Us - those who wronged this Beauty were of the people of the Bayan, who were renowned among all creation. They arose in such wise that none can recount it. By God! Because of this all who dwell in the heavens and earth wept, and all within the sacred and impregnable pavilion. They imagine within themselves that they have believed in God and the Manifestation of His Self, but when the veils were rent asunder and the Countenance of the Chosen One appeared, they dispersed from around Him, denied Him, warred against His Self, and disputed His verses. Thus has it befallen this Youth, if thou be of those who know. O servant! Stand firm in thy love for thy Lord and turn not unto those who have wronged and associated partners with God. Then seek the grace of Him Who was observed above the horizon of eternity with My Most Glorious Name. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have stood firm in the Cause at which the feet of every learned one have slipped.</p>
<p>O servant! Make mention from Us to him who was named Husayn, that he may rejoice within himself at having been remembered by the Pen of Holiness, and may stand firm in that which was inscribed in the Tablet. Then glorify him who was named Hasan in the Kingdom of Names and who was at that time mentioned before the Throne. Say: Blessed are ye both if ye forsake sovereignty behind you and turn with your hearts unto God Who created you by His command and guided you to a holy and wondrous path.</p>

Blessed is the one whose strength was not weakened by the power of the divines from attaining this manifest grace. O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. We have heard thy call and answered thee, and witnessed thy turning and turned unto thee from this Spot which hath been named by all names in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Let not the affairs of men grieve thee, nor the deeds of the aggressive ones prevent thee. Arise to remember and praise amidst the peoples of creation. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. We make mention in this place of thy father who was adorned with the ornament of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the All-Merciful.

Nothing that is seen today shall endure - all shall perish in less than a moment, and there shall remain for Him and His chosen ones that which hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen and ordained by My binding, mighty Command. Rejoice, O Muhammad, in this Most Great Remembrance. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to pour forth upon thee patience from His presence and to console thee through His grace.

Alas, the very trees are sighing in their separation from thee, the flowers are mourning in their bereavement, and the twin streams are weeping in their desolation –yea, their sorrows have afflicted all the gardens of the earth. All joy and blissfulness be thine, O Sali?, for the Lord did bless thee in thy life and in thy death; and thou wast mentioned by the Pen of Glory in the Most Exalted Paradise on the day thou didst repair to God, the Lord of men –a day whereon the dwellers of the realms above inhaled from thee the heavenly fragrance of thy garden. Radiant glory and effulgent splendour be upon all who seek out thy resting-place, who visit thee, and call thee to remembrance for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds; and upon thee, upon thy beginning and thy end, upon thy outer and thy inner being, rest His light and mercy, his grace, his loving favours, his providence and blessings.</p>

<p>Know, O people of Baha, that Satan joined forces with the Persian devil and they both betrayed the Cause of their Lord, the All-Merciful. They wrote letters in the name of one of My loved ones, wherein they wrote whatsoever they wished that would disturb nations and governments. Then they contrived until these letters reached the princes, whereupon the fire of sedition and calamity was kindled and the winds of might and destiny were stirred up. They seized Satan and his companion on Our behalf, and after his ordeal he wrote to the Persian devil saying “I was with you, so protect me from this overwhelming tribulation.” He replied “There is no escape for you. I am innocent of you.” Then shone forth the sun of the word that dawned from the horizon of the mouth of Muhammad, the Messenger of God - His word is the truth - when He said: “When Satan says to man ‘Disbelieve!’, then when he disbelieves, Satan says ‘I am innocent of you.’” Judge fairly, by God, O servants of the All-Merciful, regarding the Youth’s Cause. Every person of insight and fairness bears witness that the Youth has never relied upon anyone in God’s Cause, nor sought help from any soul. Through Him the remembrance of God was exalted among all else, the pillars of remembrance and utterance were raised up, the sun of exposition shone forth from the horizon of the will of the All-Merciful, and the breezes of glory wafted from the right hand of certitude. Yet despite this Cause which none deny save those filled with hatred and enmity, the polytheists denied it and took Satan as their lord. Woe unto them and their deeds! And he who was in Iraq among Satan’s hosts united openly there with the Persians and denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Hear thou My words and arise to aid this Wronged One. And verily thy aid to Him is thy remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Thus does the Youth command thee out of love for thyself. Trust thou in all matters in God. Verily He aids whomsoever He willeth through His command, and He is powerful over all things.</p>

And We informed the people in every leaf, nay in every line, of this Most Great Revelation. Yet when He came and was made manifest, the people denied God, the Lord of creation. Among the polytheists was one who said He had issued a ruling against souls. Say: What ails thee, O lying polytheist? By God, He hath issued no ruling against anyone. Rather, he who hath issued rulings against God and His loved ones is thou who hast taken him as thy lord, O doubting polytheist. By the life of God, I am innocent of all that the wrongdoers say. To this beareth witness the Mother Book that is with Him. When He ordaineth a thing, none may say “Why?” or “How?” And as for him who said He hath turned away from God, the Lord of lords, say: Consider when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, the servants turned away from Him. Then after successive years passed, He ordered the shedding of blood until blood flowed upon the earth. To this beareth witness the world of the hidden and the manifest. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and none can escape His decree. By God, I, despite My power and authority, have not passed judgment nor issued rulings against those who have denied God and His sovereignty. Rather, I have withdrawn and closed the doors. They have perpetrated in this land that which hath violated God’s sanctity among His servants. To this beareth witness every pebble of the city, every stone and clod and wall. The ocean of My patience hath held Me back from confronting them, and the mountain of My forbearance hath prevented Me from arising. I have witnessed from them that which hath caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament, yet I concealed it through My name, the Concealer. When the fire increased within their souls, God cast discord among them and seized them with the grasp of One mighty and omnipotent. Thus have We informed thee and acquainted thee with some of what hath befallen in the Most Great Prison through what the hands of the wicked have wrought. Read thou the Tablet, that perchance the star of divine knowledge may shine forth from the horizon of possibility. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath believed in God, the Single, the One, the Chosen One.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who hath conquered all who are in earth and heaven! The Book hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen as it moved between the fingers of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Therein hath been sent down all things and every wise matter been distinctly set forth. A single letter thereof surpasseth all that the people possess, yet most of them are heedless. The Lord of Books hath been sent down, yet they, in their own vain imaginings, count themselves among the thoughtful. The Lord of Names hath appeared with the sovereignty of His Most Glorious Name, yet they remain devoted to names they have heard from their fathers - verily they are among the most lost! We have ordained for them the laws of religion, yet they turn away therefrom. The Word of God hath appeared and the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the Most Great Throne, yet most people do not understand. The Promised Day hath come and the Intended One drawn nigh, yet most people remain far removed. The Rock hath recognized the Lord of all creation, yet they recognize not. The Tree hath testified that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and the Dove hath warbled upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Names,” yet the people witness not. The Kingdom of heaven hath been adorned with the ornament of God, and the realm of might with this wondrous Name. Say: O people, open your eyes! The horizon of the Cause hath been adorned with this Hidden Name. Blessed is he who hath beheld, and woe unto those who turn away! He desireth for you naught save what shall profit you in the worlds which none can reckon save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Place not your trust in what ye possess; rather trust in the grace of God. Verily He hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude with a manifest light. Say: It behooveth every servant to recognize his Lord. Whoso hath not recognized Him is assuredly among the transgressors. Ye have been created for this Day - wherefore have ye turned away therefrom after being promised it in a preserved Tablet? Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken out of love for thyself, that thou mayest hear His call and be of them that are firmly established. Read thou the Tablet of the All-Merciful with spirit and fragrance. Through it God openeth unto the heart of whomsoever He willeth the gates of knowledge and wisdom. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the name of the one incomparable Friend! The fragrances of the verses have diffused and the sovereignty of the clear proofs has encompassed all who dwell on earth. Verily, he who attains today is accounted among the most exalted of creation, and he who is deprived is among the perishing ones. God willing, may all the loved ones of God attain to the fragrances of His days, be mindful of His remembrance, and remain firm and steadfast in His Cause. Whosoever today has quaffed the choice wine of remembrance and utterance from the cup of the bounty of the All-Merciful is accounted before God; however, this station is not complete except through steadfastness in His Cause, such that the remembrances of all who dwell on earth would not prevent him from the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Dayspring of inspiration. O friends! Fix your gaze upon God at all times and act according to that which He commands. Consider the imaginings of the people as non-existent and know the clamor of the servants to be null. Praise be to God! The sun of utterance has risen from the horizon of will and the ocean of knowledge is surging. Strive that ye may drink of the everlasting Kawthar and attain unto the enduring choice wine. The fragrances of forgiveness have wafted from the direction of the mercy of the All-Merciful upon all, and all are today, through the transcendent, sublime bounty of that Sovereign of existence, sanctified and purified from all sins, for the forgiving, the kind One’s pardon has encompassed all. However, ye must henceforth be so enkindled with the fire of the love of God that no one would be able to extinguish it. Place thy trust in God in all matters. Verily, He loveth them that put their trust in Him. Then strive that there may appear from thee that whereby thy remembrance shall endure in My noble tablet. We beseech God to assist thee and His loved ones to act in accordance with what He loveth and is pleased with, to aid you to remain firm in the Most Great Steadfastness, and to draw you nigh unto the Most Exalted Horizon. He is, verily, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be not grieved at the world and whatsoever is therein. By God! He hath ordained for you that which nothing that hath been created in the heavens and earth can equal. Preserve ye this station lest obliteration overtake it.

And thou knowest that I have not associated with him nor with any other souls, and only met with him in my brother’s house for about an hour after he had sought permission to attain the presence. Thus was the matter and thou art among the witnesses. He hath spoken before the people concerning me that which he hath spoken, out of spite against God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things. He knoweth what thy tongue hath uttered and what hath passed through thy heart, and He is knowing of all things.

<p>In the name of the peerless Lord, the Supreme Pen in the Most Great Prison makes mention of His loved ones, that all may drink, with utmost sanctity and detachment, from the Kawthar of utterance which flows in the days of the All-Merciful. Most of the friends have not attained the presence of the Most Holy Court and have not understood, as they ought, the meanings of the divine words. Therefore, today they remain deprived of the fountain of God’s commandments. Likewise, some have committed reprehensible deeds according to their carnal desires and have attributed them to the Truth, and the helpless servants who were unaware of the essence of the Cause have, by following such souls, strayed far from the straight path. It is incumbent and obligatory upon you to arise to serve the Cause and to purify and sanctify weak souls from the defilement of selfish desires. The Most Holy Book hath been sent down from the holy Kingdom and the divine commandments are manifest therein without veil or concealment. All must act according to it. Any person of understanding who reflects even slightly will recognize that the Cause of God has been and ever shall be sanctified from selfish desires. Strive that all may drink from the Kawthar of sanctity and, with utmost detachment, gaze toward the highest horizon and act according to that which hath been revealed by God. We have mentioned thee in truth that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, and We have sent down unto thee this Tablet that thou mayest arise to serve thy Lord and assist thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Speak thou with truth, then remind the people of what We have taught thee in this Clear Book, that perchance they may abandon what they possess and take hold of that which they have been commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God hath pardoned what is past. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Generous. Henceforth it behooveth every soul to act according to what hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. Convey My greetings to My loved ones, then gladden them with the mention of My remembrance of them. Verily thy Lord is the Rememberer, the Giver, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>The Most Exalted Pen makes mention of His loved ones who dwell in Furugh, that all may be illumined and enlightened by the effulgences of the Sun of divine utterance, and may, with utmost love and unity, engage in the remembrance of God. The renewal of the world is a clear proof of its origination, and its very origination is a manifest evidence of its ultimate extinction. That which is everlasting and eternal is a station which no soul hath truly comprehended, save whom God willeth. Today, that which is befitting and worthy for those who have turned to God is to adorn themselves with the ornament of divine commandments and to appear among the servants with goodly and pleasing character. This is the cause of the exaltation of God’s Cause. Blessed are they who attain! Strive ye, that in the days of God there may appear from you that which shall cause the preservation of souls and spirits. Praise be to God! The ocean of utterance is manifest, the heaven of bounty is raised up, and the sun of grace is shining. Hold ye fast unto truth and become detached from all else. Associate with one another with the utmost love and kindness, and transgress not the counsel of the counselor who dwelleth in that land. By My life! This bounty sufficeth all, that the Dawning-Place of grace and the Dayspring of revelation in the Most Great Prison is occupied with your remembrance.

Thy letter hath come before Us time and again. We answer thee through this clear Book. The servant present before Us hath presented what thou didst send unto him.

The servant present before Us hath presented what thou didst send unto the Name of Bounty. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.

God willing, may ye be assisted in that which is befitting this Day and be enabled to fulfill what God hath sent down in the Book. The weak among the people have been held back from the Dawning-Place of the Self-Subsisting by vain imaginings, and the sources of conjecture, who are the ignorant ones of the age, have become a barrier between eyes and the effulgent rays of the countenance of the Lord of Names. Glory be to God! Every person of understanding is amazed at how they have deprived themselves of everlasting and eternal blessings through the various colors of a day or two. It is incumbent upon all to beseech God that He may, through the finger of His power, rend asunder the thick veils and withhold not the people of the world from the ocean of His grace. Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Encompassing.

Say: O deceiver, by what proof didst thou believe in God and in Muhammad the Apostle of God? Was it by mere words or by what thou findest in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise? By God! This indeed is the Most Great Book which speaketh amidst the world and guideth the peoples to His straight path.

Have thy ranks deceived thee, or thy thousands, or the clash of thy swords, or the neighing of thy steeds? Turn thee to the graves that thou mayest learn what befell thy like, O remote oppressor! Will thy riches profit thee, or thy might, or the host that marcheth before thee, or the banners that flutter behind thee? By the life of God! Nothing of all things shall profit thee, nor what thou hast amassed of the vanities of the world. Cast away what thou hast and turn thy face unto the Countenance. We counsel thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. Hearts have melted by reason of thy tyranny, and the hands of the loved ones have been raised because of thy deeds. Know thou of a certainty that they shall not return except through the fulfillment of what they desire from the heaven of the bounty of their Lord, the Gracious. Take hold of the reins of passion, O thou who hast turned away from God, the Lord of all men, and turn unto Him that He may forgive thee what thou hast wrought in His days. Thus doth command thee He Who witnesseth at all times unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. There is no God but Him, the One, the Mighty, the Great. O thou who art saddened by My sorrow and hast borne hardships for My sake, hearken unto My call.

<p>O Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God! He is established upon the Throne of Utterance. This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the Lord of the worlds, and it summons all people to a station wherein all things proclaim: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised!” Blessed is he who is endowed with vision whom the veils of men have not hindered, and blessed is he who is endowed with hearing whom the clamor of the heedless has not shut out. Blessed is the servant who has broken the chains of idle fancies through the Name of the Lord of Days and hastened with his heart to this luminous horizon. We have beheld thy turning unto the lights of the Countenance and have revealed for thee that whereby the eyes of those who have drawn nigh are solaced - they who have borne in the path of God that which none among His servants hath borne. To this doth testify He with Whom is a mighty Book. When thou dost inhale the sweet-scented breezes of the All-Merciful’s utterance, arise, detached from all else but God, turning unto the Station and say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Countenance, and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, and the mysteries of Thy Book, to aid me in all conditions to serve Thee and to serve Thy loved ones. O my Lord! Thou seest me agitated in Thy days and attracted by Thy verses. By Thy glory, O my God! My heart findeth no rest save in attaining Thy presence, and my soul no repose save in hearkening to Thy call. Alas, alas, should Thy decree prevent me from attaining the court of Thy glory! I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Goal of the nations, to forgive my grievous sins and mighty transgressions. Then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones who have offered up their spirits and all they possessed in Thy path. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Peerless, the One, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious. O God! My God and the God of all beings, my Goal and the Goal of all created things! Send Thy blessings, O my God, upon those whom neither the might of the oppressors hath deterred from drawing nigh unto Thee, nor the hosts of the aggressors from turning to the light of Thy Countenance. They have arisen to promote Thy Cause and have spoken forth Thy Name before the faces of Thine enemies, despite those who denied Thy proof and Thy signs, and who committed that which caused the dwellers of Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm to lament. There is none other God but Thee, the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.”</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who rules over all who are in the heavens and on earth! This is a Book sent down in truth from God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds, that the call may draw you again and again unto a station where neither the allusions of the people shall hinder you, nor the clamor of the oppressors disturb you. Your letter attained the presence of God, the Lord of Manifestation, and We heard that which you addressed unto your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We found it adorned with the mention of the Beloved and embellished with the love of your Ancient Lord. Therefore did the ocean of grace surge and the winds of your Lord’s mercy, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, were stirred. Rejoice in what We have sprinkled upon you from the seas of pardon and forgiveness. This, verily, is a manifest bounty. We beseech God to assist you at all times, to aid you in that which He loves and is pleased with, and to cause you to speak forth this mighty remembrance. You wrote at the end of your letter “the one despairing of God’s mercy.” By My life! This befits not these days. Write henceforth “the one assured of his Lord’s tender care, the All-Mighty, the All-Loving, His servant David.” Thus does My Most Exalted Pen teach you, through whose effect the Kingdom is perfumed, through whose breaths the dead are raised up, and through whose fragrance the birds do sing. Sovereignty belongs to God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Beautiful. O David! Hearken unto that wherewith your Lord, the Sincere Counselor, the Trusted One, counsels you. Strive that there may appear from you that which befits His sovereignty, His grandeur, His detachment and His sanctity. Thus does the Lord of all worlds command you. Thus have We loosened the reins of the Pen of Revelation in the meadows of utterance, as a bounty from your Lord, the Most Merciful, that you may soar on the wings of detachment in this atmosphere which none among all created things can breathe save those whom your Lord has willed by His sovereignty which overshadows the worlds. Should you find the sweetness of this Tablet, you would arise with your whole being to serve your Lord and would say by night and day: “Praise be to You, O Lord of all mankind, and glory be to You, O You Who art wronged throughout all regions, and splendor be to You, O Beloved of them that know!” Convey My greetings unto her whom you mentioned in your letter and unto your wife who has believed in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Sufficient unto them both is God’s glorification from this wondrous horizon.</p>

<p>Your letter was seen and your call was heard. God willing, may you ever gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and attain to that which He loves and is pleased with. May you desire none but Him and seek to cling to none but Him. Today the ocean of generosity is surging and the sun of bounty is manifest and radiant. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized and turned unto Him, and woe unto the heedless ones. This Day hath been adorned with the ornament of the utterance of the Manifestations of the All-Merciful, for all have promised and given glad tidings of it. Blessed are they that have attained! By the Sun of inner meanings which adorns the Sun of the All-Merciful’s utterance, this tablet is dearer and more enduring than a hundred thousand righteous children. For a righteous child and all existing things in the world shall soon return to nothingness, but the Word of God revealed from the Most Exalted Pen shall not be seized by extinction nor pursued by death. Reflect, that thou mayest find thyself in manifest joy. Today man is able to attain such a station that his remembrance, like a star in the heaven of God’s Tablet, may shine bright and radiant through the eternity of His names and attributes. Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me from Thy Most Exalted Pen while I was in the Most Great Prison due to that which the hands of the enemies who turned away from Thee and from Thy mighty signs had wrought. O my Lord! I have turned toward Thee and faced Thy horizon. I beseech Thee, by the oppression of the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily Thou knowest me better than I know myself, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O Aqa Siyyid Mahdi of Najafabad!</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Pure, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The Word of God hath in truth been sent down from the heaven of grace upon the world. Verily it is the Most Great Mystery in the Concourse on High, the Most Noble Symbol in the heaven of splendor, the Most Hidden Secret in the kingdom of immortality, and the Beauty of Glory amidst the hosts of creation. O people! Hasten ye unto it and tarry not even for a moment. Beware lest ye alter it according to your own imaginings or change it from that which God hath ordained for it in the Mother Book. Thus hath the command been sent down from the heaven of grace upon the world. O people! Follow what God hath commanded you from the heaven of His Cause and cast it not behind your backs. This is what this Youth, Who hath been mentioned by the name of God amongst the peoples of the world, counseleth you. Beware, O people, lest ye deny Him in Whom ye have believed and turn away from Him unto Whom ye have turned. This is the best counsel, did ye but know it. Sever yourselves from that which draweth you to vain desire and hold fast unto this firm handle, that haply ye may attain unto a station of luminous glory. Say: Today nothing shall profit anyone, even should he remember God while standing, sitting, at dawn or eventide. O Mahdi! Guide thyself, then guide the people by this Sun which hath dawned from the horizon of holiness with manifest sovereignty, that perchance the people may recognize their Creator, differ not in His Cause, and find unto Him the true path. Say: Your belief profiteth Him not, nor doth your denial harm Him. Whatsoever appeareth from you returneth unto yourselves, while He, at His most exalted station, through His name the All-Knowing, hath ever been sanctified above the worlds. Thus hath the Ancient King commanded thee. Arise and act as thou hast been bidden by the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Compelling. And glory be upon thee and upon its people from this moment until the day when the heavens shall be cleft asunder and God shall come in overshadowing clouds.</p>

<p>He is the Compassionate, the Generous!</p>
<p>O Haji bearing the name of the All-Desired One! Ever do the traces of grace, mercy, compassion and loving-kindness appear and manifest from the Treasury of the Supreme Pen. Every word of the exalted utterances that appears from the Dayspring of the Will of the Lord of Names is a clear Book, a wise Command, and a momentous Announcement. Blessed are they who have attained to its recognition and received their portion from the ocean of its meanings.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! We have heard thy call and answer thee with this most mighty, most holy Tablet. The word of pardon and forgiveness hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning thee. Give thanks to the Goal of all worlds that thou hast attained to this greatest bounty and supreme mercy. The keys of the treasures of the world are in the grasp of His power - He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. That which causeth the fragrance of loving-kindness to be diffused hath been ordained for thee.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have turned unto Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy loving-kindness and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the breezes of the morn of Thy Revelation and the places honored by Thy footsteps, which Thou hast made the seat of Thy throne, that Thou forgive me and make me of those who have been so captured by the choice wine of Thy revelation and inspiration that nothing whatsoever hath deterred them from drawing nigh unto Thy most exalted horizon and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all being! My Lord! Thou seest this servant of Thine seeking pardon from the ocean of Thy mercy, blessings from the heaven of Thy bounty, and steadfastness from the Sun of Thy loving-kindness. Ordain for me, O my God, the good of this world and the next, and that which shall be a light unto me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art He at Whose gifts and favors all things have proclaimed their praise. Then I beseech Thee, O Master of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>I know not, O my God, whether I should speak forth the wonders of Thy praise among Thy servants, and lay bare before them the secrets of Thy mercy and the mysteries of Thy Cause, or keep them wrapped up within the receptacle of my heart. Though the lover be loth to share with any one the intimate conversation of his beloved, yet at whatever time Thine inescapable commandment to declare Thy Cause reacheth me, I will unhesitatingly obey it. I would proclaim Thee, undeterred by the darts of affliction that may rain down upon me from the clouds of Thy decree.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy might! Neither the hosts of the earth nor those of heaven can keep me back from revealing the things I am commanded to manifest. I have no will before Thy will, and can cherish no desire in the face of Thy desire. By Thy grace I am, at all times, ready to serve Thee and am rid of all attachment to any one except Thee.</p>
<p>What I desire, however, O my God, is that Thou shouldst bid me unveil the things which lie hid in Thy knowledge, so that they who are wholly devoted to Thee may, in their longing for Thee, soar up into the atmosphere of Thy oneness, and the infidels may be seized with trembling and may return to the nethermost fire, the abode ordained for them by Thee through the power of Thy sovereign might.</p>
<p>Thou dost consider, O my Lord, how Thy dear ones are sore pressed by Thine enemies, and hearest from all sides their sighing by reason of what hath befallen them in Thy path. Thou knowest, O my Lord, that their one desire was to seek Thy face, and that the sole Object of their adoration was Thee. They who wronged them had no other purpose except to turn them away from Thee, and to extinguish the fire which Thou hadst kindled with the hands of Thine almighty power.</p>
<p>Unseal the lips of Thy will, O my Lord, and let a word proceed therefrom that shall subject unto itself the world and all that is therein. How long shalt Thou behold these things and tarry, O my God? Darkness hath enveloped the whole earth, and Thy tokens are ready to be blotted out throughout Thy realm.</p>
<p>Forgive me, O my God, for what I have spoken, for Thou art the One that knoweth all things, and in Thee are wrapped up the secrets that are hid from all else except Thyself. When Thy promise shall come to pass, Thou wilt manifest what Thou wilt, and subdue as Thou pleasest. We should wish only what Thou hast wished for us. In Thee is the knowledge of all things, and with Thee is the issue of all things. Thou art, verily, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Forgive me, then, my sins and the sins of them that love me, and supply them with the good of this world and of the next.</p>
<p>Thou art, verily, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.</p>

<p>O My Beloved! The book of mystical knowledge hath been sent down from the Countenance of Certitude. It carried away the heart and bestowed the spirit, it bore away strength and granted power. It seemed as though a letter thereof was an ocean, giving the water of life to the thirsty ones in the valley of love, and bestowing the wine of reunion upon the wanderers in the land of separation. Yea, if there be an attentive ear, it will surely distinguish the call of the Dove from the croaking of the raven. After all, the melody of the divine Nightingale differeth greatly from the cry of the earthly crow. If imitation be cast aside, the holy breath will rise from the depth of the soul, and with the eye of the spirit one will behold the beauty of the Beloved and perceive the countenance of the Beloved One behind a thousand veils. O my soul and my spirit! The unity of the worlds of oneness hath fresh stations and infinite degrees. In one station it is sanctified above description and utterance, mention and explanation, and at this level form and body and flesh and name and trace have no place at all, that anyone should find a way unto it or comprehend love and affection or enumerate longing and rapture. It is treasured in the invisible treasury and stored in the vessels of mystery. And in another station it comprehendeth all names and attributes, that is, all names refer back to it and become manifest from it. In this station the people of the Furqan have clung to mere fancy, and the companions of the Bayan have held fast to limitations. Neither have those ones drunk from the eternal sea of mystical knowledge, nor have these ones reached the eternal dwelling place of God. Therefore we must pass beyond transient allusions and enter the eternal garden, that we may drink from the eternal spring and taste of the eternal fruit, that we may detach our hearts from aught else and attach them to the court of the Beloved, that we may comprehend the virgin meanings from the spiritual countenance. Were I to speak, it would overwhelm all minds; Were I to write, many a pen would break.</p>

<p>O Mirza Yahya Masihi, upon him be the glory of God, He Who has dawned from the horizon of the heaven of the Bayan! This is the day wherein the attraction of the Call that was raised from the direction of ’Akka hath seized Mount Sinai. Thereupon all things cried out: “At Thy service, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! Blessed be the city that hath attained unto Thy presence, and the land that hath been honored by Thy footsteps. Woe betide him who hath heard and denied the announcement of God, the Mighty, the Wise.” And Carmel called out: “Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the world and Beloved of the nations, for having manifested Thyself and honored me with Thy presence after the fire of separation from Thee had well-nigh destroyed me. I testify that through Thee was fulfilled that which was recorded in the Books and inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of the worlds.” Then the Call was raised from Bethlehem saying: “At Thy service, O Thou through Whom the ocean of knowledge surged before the faces of all religions! At Thy service, O Thou through Whom the gate of reunion was opened when Thou didst give Thy lovers to drink, from the hand of Thy bounty, the Kawthar of Thy presence! I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy verses and by that which hath been raised from the direction of Thy prison, to aid Thy people to acknowledge Thy Manifestation and to confess that which Thou hast revealed through Thy grace. I testify that Thou hast fulfilled Thy Covenant and that which Thou didst promise to Thy loved ones and servants in Thy Books and Tablets, and Thou hast come from the horizon of power with Thy great glory.”</p>
<p>O Light! Hearken unto the Call of the Lord of all beings. Today Mount Sinai is gladdened by the presence of its Beloved and with the most exalted call giveth the glad-tidings unto all things, while Zion speaketh the word “Hasten ye!” Blessed is the soul that hath drunk from the imperishable Kawthar and hath attained unto the hearing of the Call. O thou who hast turned! We have heard thy call and from the direction of the prison have turned toward thee and made mention of thee with verses that shall never change nor be effaced. Say: My God, my God! Aid me to remember Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy servants with the wisdom Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. I beseech Thee to enable me to arise to serve Thee and to mention that which hath appeared in Thy days. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>

It brings glad tidings to the people of this Day whereon He hath been established upon a great throne, and it warneth the people of a grievous day of retribution. O people! Fear God and follow not every sinful repudiator. Verily he whom the people of error have taken as a protector besides God is in manifest error and flame. He hath turned away and withdrawn, then retreated and fabricated. By God, he hath appeared with evident calumny. O people! Fear God and draw not nigh unto him. He calleth you unto his self, from which the manifestations of polytheism seek refuge with God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Peerless. He believed not in Him Who revealed the Bayan nor in that which was sent down in a preserved and mighty Tablet. Say: By God, he hath not read the Bayan, nor doth he read it except to lead you astray from the path. And whenever he reciteth the verses of God, the True King, the Just, the Trustworthy, the Spirit that circleth round the words of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great, addresseth him saying: “Hast thou disbelieved in Him Who created thee from a handful of clay? If thou didst believe in the verses of God, why didst thou fabricate against Him by Whose command the Scriptures of God were sent down from all eternity, and this perspicuous Book? Fear God and follow not thy self and thy passion. Rather, follow the religion of the Spirit, which is the love of Him Who hath appeared with the truth and come with manifest authority. Be not confused in thyself, nor make thyself deserving of God’s wrath and vengeance. Fear the day wherein the hearts of the deniers shall tremble.” Say: “I have believed in God and His Messengers and His Books, and unto Him do I turn, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.” O thou who gazest toward the realm of immortality! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, and say: “In the Name of God, the Quickener of Names.” Then burn away the veils of the heedless through the heat of thy Lord’s love and say: “Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, and glory be upon thee and upon them that have believed in God, the Mighty, the Wise.”</p>

He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Blessed be thine ear, for it hath heard His melodies, and thine eye, for it hath fallen upon His beauteous countenance. For everyone who hath visited that place and remained steadfast in His love, God hath written the reward of one martyred in His path, even though he be living at that time. Thus hath His mercy preceded all worlds. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord, then aid Him through remembrance and be not of them that remain silent. Verily silence is praiseworthy except in My remembrance and praise, if thou be of them that know. Cast behind thee all created things, then turn to the Lord of the First and the Last.

Arise from the couches of passion. This is your Lord, the Most Glorious, Who hath come with a manifest light. Have ye forsaken God and taken vain imaginings as lords for yourselves?

Say: Is conjecture better for you, or the light that hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude? Be fair, O people, and follow not every heedless sinner. Thus have We revealed unto thee that thou mayest remember thy Lord amongst the servants, that perchance Our slumbering servants may be awakened thereby. Say: O my Lord!

And when the Spirit desireth to depart from bodies, the temples of existence quake - then hearken unto the cry of the people of earth, for this is from the terror of a Day which was decreed as inevitable. Say: The Spirit at that time departeth from Iraq and turneth toward a western direction. Thereat do the heavens and earth weep every morn and eve, and the tears of the mystics flow upon radiant crimson cheeks, and the Maidens in their chambers strike their heads with hands white and dyed. Among the people are those who are heedless of this, and those whose tears flow ceaselessly in separation, and those who rejoice at this, and those who are consumed by this fire. Say: O concourse of earth! Rejoice not at this, but rather weep for what hath passed you by of the holy breezes of union. Say: The earth hath borne the burden of this greatest terror, and soon shall it give birth to its load. Then shall ye flee to the right and find no friend for yourselves, and run to the left and find no helper for your beings.

<p>O Haji Mirza Hasan-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great! This is a Tablet that hath been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise, and giveth glad tidings unto the people on this Day whereon the All-Merciful hath seated Himself upon the throne of His Great Name. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of the garment, arise amidst the servants with wisdom and utterance, and remind them of that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Ancient of Days with manifest sovereignty. The land of Syria hath been honored by the advent of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. This is a land wherein was raised the call of the Prophets and Messengers. We have addressed it saying: “Blessed art thou in that thou hast attained unto the presence of thy Lord! Do they that dwell within thee turn unto God, the Lord of Names, or do they deny Him even as they denied Him aforetime?” Whereupon it cried out saying: “Verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” The fragrances of the All-Glorious have seized the land of Batha. It hath stirred and flourished, and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds! I perceive the fragrance of Thy reunion as though Thou hadst unveiled Beauty after having concealed it from all mankind. Blessed is the land whereon Thy dominion hath been established, and blessed are the servants who have attained unto the light of Thy resplendent countenance.” We hear the call of all things declaring that there is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous. Among them are those who know and glorify His praise, and among them are those who make mention yet remain among the heedless. Arise thou amidst the people of the Bayan in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Say: O people! The proof hath come, and this is He to Whom the Bayan hath testified. Fear God and follow not him who hath disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Powerful. When anyone cometh unto you with tablets of fire and the book of wickedness, cast them behind you and turn unto the Countenance, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made Thyself known unto us and removed from us the veil through Thy sovereignty. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.” Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses and made them lamps of guidance for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Take hold of the Tablet with the power of thy Lord. By My life! Nothing shall harm thee through it, even should all who are on earth combine against thee. And praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Jinab Aqa Siyyid Aqa! In the Name of God, the All-Knowing! This is a Tablet from before the Youth to him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Glorious, the All-Knowing. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all faces and held fast to the Sure Handle which hath appeared in truth from before God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing. Say: O people! The Suns of eternity have shone forth from the Most Glorious Horizon, and the Command hath been detailed in the Tablets of Destiny, and the Hands of Power have emerged from the sleeves. Say: The heavens of turning away have been cleft asunder, and the earths have been eclipsed, and the clouds have been rent, and God hath come in canopies of cloud, and by Him all things have been adorned with the garments of names, and He hath been established upon the throne of His name, the All-Merciful, and on His right was the Point of the Bayan, and on His left were the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Say: We gave you glad tidings before in all the Tablets of this Manifestation Who hath appeared in truth, and then of these days. Say: He hath come with the truth, and by Him the fruits have fallen from the trees, and the souls of the righteous were stirred, and the pillars of creation were shaken. They who have denied this Manifestation yet claim belief in the previous Manifestations - by God the Truth, they are but as cattle. Say: By Him the earth was established and heaven was raised up, and the sun of grandeur shone forth from the horizon of eternity, then the standards were upraised. Say: O people! Deny not Him Who calleth you unto God. Fear God, then rend asunder the veils of idle fancies. And thou, distance thyself from all things and draw nigh unto God thy Lord. He sufficeth thee through His grace, and He is verily the Generous, the Bountiful. He giveth to whom He willeth and withholdeth from whom He willeth, and raiseth up whom He willeth and bringeth low whom He willeth, and preserveth whom He willeth from illness. Be thou steadfast in My Cause and fear not Mine enemies. Verily thy Lord will protect thee from those who have denied God on the Day of Resurrection. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have drunk the choice wine sealed from the hand of this Youth.</p>

<p>O Mim of Glory! Thou didst ascend with joy and fragrance, while thy loved ones remained in grief. Thus hath the All-Merciful decreed. He, verily, is the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Thou wert God’s remnant when the idolaters drove Me from the Land of Ta, and thou didst burn with the fire of separation for numbered years. When the appointed time came, We guided thee to the Kawthar of reunion until thou didst enter the prison and sacrifice thyself before the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed art thou and blessed he that turneth unto thee, and visiteth thy grave, and draweth nigh, through thee, unto God, the Lord of all that was and shall be. O Ha of the Divine Essence! Thou didst seek the heights of holiness and forsake the world in the path of thy Lord. I testify that thou didst ascend to a praiseworthy station and I testify that thou didst return in meekness unto thine abode. Great is thy blessedness and the blessedness of them that hold fast unto the hem of thy outspread robe. O Dal of Eternity! Through thee that land and its surroundings have been honored. Thou art, verily, the trust of God and His treasure in this land. Erelong will God reveal through thee that which He hath desired. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. When thou wast laid to rest in the earth, the earth itself trembled in its longing to meet thee. Thus hath it been decreed, and yet the people perceive not. O Ya of Pre-existence! Blessed art thou for having sacrificed thy spirit in the Most Great Prison, after being in the hands of those who denied God on the Promised Day. Were We to recount the mysteries of thine ascension, they that are asleep would waken, and all beings would be set ablaze with the fire of the remembrance of My Name, the Mighty, the Loving. O thou who art mentioned before the Face! We have recounted unto thee what hath befallen the Branch of God this day, that thou mayest be informed of what hath been ordained in the prison by thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Grieve thou not. Give thanks unto thy Lord in all conditions. He is with those who remember Him and act according to His command. May glory rest upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves in His love from such as have joined partners with God.</p>

<p>Can the Tablet contain the mysteries of thy Lord? Can the Pen flow with what He hath willed? Nay, by His very Self, the True One! Rather only with what the people are capable of bearing. Thus hath the Command gone forth from the Dayspring of Revelation when He appeared with manifest sovereignty. O people! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the divine wilderness, this praiseworthy station. Then detach yourselves from whatsoever ye possess, turning unto God. This is better for you than what hath been and what shall be. By My life! The Water of Life hath flowed in all times, yet the people perceive it not. Among them are those who fled, and those who partook and said: “In Thy Name, O Beloved One!” and drank in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Loving. Be as thy Lord desireth. When thou attainest unto the Tablet of thy Lord, turn with thy heart to the Qiblih of all horizons and say: “Praise be to Thee, O Knower of the seen and unseen, for having caused to flow upon me from the oceans of Thy Most Great Name that which causeth spirits to soar and minds to be startled. I testify that through Thee the banners of victory were hoisted and the standards of guidance were raised amidst all created things, while the flags of the rebellious were brought low. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all who are in the heavens and earth, and through which the people of the graves arose, to preserve me beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy singleness. Then make me of those who soared in the atmosphere of Thy love and spoke in Thy remembrance until their spirits took flight from their bodies in their longing to meet Thee.” Thus was the matter ordained by One mighty and praiseworthy. O my Lord! I am he who hath turned toward the direction of Thy grace and raised the hands of supplication to the heaven of Thy bounty. Send down upon me that which will render me sincere toward Thyself and a servant of Thy Cause. I testify that Thou art the Intended One and all else is as naught, and that Thou art the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Therefore manifest in the kingdom conquering hands and powerful hearts that they may aid Thy loved ones on earth, through Thy Name which Thou hast made the Supreme Ruler over every witness and witnessed thing. The Water of Life hath flowed through what the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in utterance. Blessed is he who hath drunk and said: “Praise be to Thee, O God of existence!”</p>

<p>Has the earth carried one whom kinship cannot prevent from turning to the Lord of creation, and who casts behind him relationships and allusions out of love for God, the Lord of names and attributes? Blessed is he who sees no glory for himself except through the glory of God and who is detached from all else. He is indeed among the most exalted of creatures before the Truth. Thus has the matter been decreed and the verses have come. And he whom love of kindred does not prevent from turning to his Lord - his face shall shine forth between earth and heaven. The hosts of the unseen and the visible shall assist him, and the angels of the Command shall aid him in drawing near to the station wherein the lights of the Divine Essence are kindled and shine forth.</p>

<p>Glory be to Thee, O my God! Thou hearest my lamentation in this Prison and knowest that I have summoned the servants only to the court of Thy mercy and favors, and have commanded them only what Thou hast commanded in the kingdom of Thy decree and the dominion of Thy judgment. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst subjugate the winds, to protect this servant who hath turned to Thee and held fast to the hem of Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou knowest what is in hearts, verily Thou art the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Thou knowest the secrets of breasts. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to strengthen him in such wise that nothing shall prevent him from Thy love, that he may arise to aid Thy Cause and stand firm in Thy Command. O Lord! When Thou hast made known to him the paths of Thy grace and guidance, deprive him not through Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

<p>O Isma’il, who dwelleth in the City! He is the Ever-Abiding One! He it is Who maketh mention in the Tablet of every goodly remembrance, that thereby the people may draw nigh unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. O Isma’il! When thy letter came before Us, it was as though thou hadst forgotten Us, yet We preceded thee in remembrance, that Our mention might precede all else in every pure and luminous heart. Know thou that calamities have encompassed Us from every side, until We were cast into a manifest prison. Days passed over Us in such hardship as hath no like, no equal, and no parallel. Yet We thank God and praise Him for what hath befallen Us, drawing nigh unto Him in His good-pleasure, for verily He is near unto the well-doers. Remember thou My days, and forget not God’s covenant within thyself. Call upon Him throughout thy days, for verily He is the All-Hearing, the Answerer, Who answereth the prayer of the supplicant when he calleth upon Him, and He is the All-Knowing. Be thou at peace in thy heart and soul through God’s grace and mercy, and be thou in great joy and hope. Should harm touch thee, grieve not, but remember My grief and place thy trust in God, thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Soon shall joy and gladness vanish from every unbeliever and fortunate one, for all this is mentioned within the bounds of contingent being and hath no permanence or endurance, as every sound soul doth testify. Strive thou within thyself to hold fast unto the luminous and mighty handle, that it may raise thee to a station wherein no harm from these idolators shall touch thee. Therefore, lift thy foot from the dust, then ascend to a station that shall never pass away, through the eternity of God, the King, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful. Therein shalt thou find rest from every opponent and peer, from every ailment and sickness, and from every fresh calamity. Thus doth the Spirit teach thee on this night and make mention of thee with most goodly remembrance, that thou mayest be of them that know. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon every assured knower.</p>

<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! The Lord of the hidden and manifest hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and maketh mention of thee. Blessed art thou, happy art thou, joy be unto thee, and felicitations be unto thee, inasmuch as thou didst hear the verses and didst behold the clear proofs and didst drink of the sealed wine and didst partake, without interruption, of the Kawthar of the love of the All-Merciful. Most of thy days were spent in the love of God. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that all that existeth and is visible on earth cannot compare with this testimony that hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning thee. Drink thou from the ocean of joy through My Name, and from the Kawthar of gladness. Praise be to God that thou didst attain unto the divine verses in these numbered years. They are better for thee than all the treasures of the earth. Therefore praise and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” Be not grieved at separation, for the reward of attainment unto His presence hath been inscribed for thee by the Pen of the Ancient of Days, and this hath been and continueth to be among the matchless bounties of God. Convey My greetings to all the friends and say: This blessed Day hath been mentioned in all the Books and Tablets and is known as the Day of God. Know ye its value and act as beseemeth it. That which is accounted this day as the most great of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficing, the Most High, is steadfastness in His Cause, for the embodiments of idle fancies have been and continue to be engaged in preventing the loved ones of God. This is why We have forewarned all aforetime. Clamor will be raised and the book of the netherworld and the tablets of fire will be spread abroad. The people of certitude who are mentioned in the Qur’an as the companions of the right hand and in the Qayyumu’l-Asma as the dwellers of the Crimson Ark must manifest such power and might that such idle persons will be powerless to prevent them. Thus hath spoken the Wronged One with that which benefiteth His loved ones in this mighty Prison. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Abu’l-Qasim, upon whom be the Glory of God. In His Name through Whom the Sun of Divine Unity has shone forth! O Abu’l-Qasim, hear with thy inner ear the call of the Wronged One. In these days certain vain imaginings have arisen. Beseech God to protect His people. The former people would each day, with the hands of idle fancy, fashion an idol of their imagination and call it the Fourth Pillar or other names. Glory be to God! One is astounded at the words and deeds of that people. Each day they would claim some new understanding and knowledge, until finally their knowledge culminated in this: One day, before attaining maturity, this Wronged One entered a gathering where two individuals wearing enormous turbans were, from behind a curtain, describing to one of the ladies their own spiritual knowledge and stations, until one of them stated that we must determine whether Gabriel is higher or Qanbar, whether ’Abbas is higher or Salman. This Wronged One was bewildered. After a few minutes it was mentioned: “O Mulla, if Gabriel is the one referred to in ‘The Faithful Spirit descended with it upon thy heart’, then Master Qanbar was not even present there.” In those days this Wronged One lamented the wrongs done to the Seal of the Prophets. I truthfully say that such wrong was done to Him by the former people that the Tablet wept and the Pen cried out - a crying that caused the Concourse on High to weep and the companions of the Most Exalted Paradise to cry out. We beseech God to protect this people from such idle fancies and vain imaginings and to keep them steadfast on the straight path. Verily He is the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful. O Abu’l-Qasim! Today the Mother Book has turned toward thee from the prison precincts. Blessed is he who hath remembered thee and sent thy name to a place named after this heaven. We have remembered thee and answered thee with verses that all the books of the world and what the nations possess cannot equal. He Who hath spoken before all faces beareth witness to this. The Kingdom and the Dominion belong to God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

His mention is renowned throughout the world and is a mighty cause for those who mount the pulpit. Most of the peoples of the world are occupied with his remembrance and that of his son, who in the Book of Deeds was designated and mentioned as the Sacrifice of God by the Pen of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Yet in this Most Great Revelation, how many pure, assured, well-pleased and enkindled souls have intended the place of sacrifice and offered up their lives! However, the unjust servants have veiled the high and most exalted stations of these souls through the veils of self and desire. Glory be to God! What has become of justice and fairness? Where have hearing and sight gone? O Abraham! The first sacrifice attained to sacrifice and returned to his place, but in this Revelation all have achieved the most great martyrdom. Say: O people! Observe with divine vision and hearken with true hearing, that perchance ye may attain unto that which hath no likeness or peer. Ask of God that He may aid His servants to that which beseemeth them, and adorn the people of the world with the light of detachment and the raiment of godliness. He is powerful and mighty. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God!

Thus was the matter decreed from the presence of the Cleaver of the dawn. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of Our servant Muhammad who attained to recognition on a day when faces turned black and eyes were frozen, that the breezes of revelation might attract him and the wine of the All-Merciful might intoxicate him in such wise that he would speak the praise of his Lord amidst all possibilities. Blessed art thou for having borne hardships in thy Lord’s path and for having inhabited the house of the heart with this remembrance which God hath made the sovereign of all remembrances. What befell Us hath befallen thee. Blessed are We and thou and every steadfast and patient believer in tribulation.

May the House be sacrificed for Thee, O Dawning-Place of the Manifestation! May our souls be sacrificed for Thee, O Lord of the servants! Thus have We cast upon you verses whereby the fragrance of the All-Merciful was diffused throughout all lands. It behooveth every soul to inhale it and say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me in prison while I was in the hands of the oppressors.

The heedlessness of pride had so seized him that he saw none but himself, and through various plots and schemes he lay in wait for a time when he could snatch the Ancient Beauty from the earth. But God, through His sovereignty, prevented him and, through His power, banished him, and through His will manifested what He wished and desired. He is the One around Whom circle power and might and grandeur and authority. And when the light of the Word shone forth, the essence of tyranny emerged from behind the veil with the swords of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and wrought that which caused the Tablet and the Pen to weep, and tears to flow from the Divine Eye. From the earliest days We have been under the rule of the oppressors, but in the Most Great Prison His Majesty the King, Sultan Abdul-Hamid Khan - may God strengthen him - has acted with kindness and compassion toward this Wronged One. In truth, in his days justice was gladdened and tyranny was concealed. Glory be unto Him Who strengthened him and seated him upon the throne of justice and fairness. He is, verily, the Lord of bounties and favors. O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! Praise the Goal of the world Who remembers thee in the Most Great Prison. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Glory! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to ordain for me that which will make me a banner of Thy Name amongst Thy servants. Then open before my face the door of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p>O leaf who art related to My name “Beauty”! The wronged One hath heard of thy sorrow and what hath befallen thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is a Day wherein every deed is weighed in the balance of thy Lord, and this is a Day wherein the earth and the mountains and the seas and the trees speak forth. Let not the happenings of the world sadden thee. Make thy joy and happiness to consist in the grace of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Be not grieved at the loss of children. God willing, He will bestow His grace. He is, verily, the Generous, the Bountiful. Whatsoever appeareth hath not been, and is not, outside of divine wisdom. The people of insight and understanding have borne and do bear witness to this truth. Today thou art blessed with something that is seen to be more distinguished and more faithful than a hundred thousand children. Today is different from other days. Every soul who hath drunk even a drop from the Kawthar of knowledge doth acknowledge that which the Pen of God hath acknowledged. Children are for the preservation of remembrance and good deeds and the perpetuation of name and the like. And if God, exalted be His glory, should bestow His grace and that child should also be adorned with the ornament of worthiness and humanity and righteousness, his remembrance would still, with the passage of time, soon come to an end. But the mention of the Most Exalted Pen endureth, through the duration of the Most Beautiful Names. Hold fast unto this, if thou be of the people of Baha. Better than what thou hast, and more exalted than that, is with thee, but thou art unaware of it. If thou shouldst become aware of it, God willing, thou shalt attain unto the most great joy and supreme happiness. Thus hath My Pen spoken, as a grace unto My name. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the inheritors of Thy Kingdom and the guardians of the House of Thy Cause to ordain for me an heir who shall inherit from me through Thy bounty and favors. Thou art, verily, the Best of inheritors. Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the mystics and Goal of the worlds and Glory of the hearts of the sincere ones.</p>

<p>O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of the love of thy Lord! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and convey unto the people that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His bounty and bestowal, that perchance they may cast away what they possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings, and may take fast hold of the cord of God’s loving providence, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and follow not every rejected transgressor and every veiled heedless one. Say: Hear ye the counsel of the Wronged One and ponder, that haply ye may not be deprived of the ocean of utterance in the Divine Day. Reflect upon the turning away of the divines of the former Faith and their followers. What was the cause that all were deprived on the Day of His Manifestation, and were forbidden from Him Whom they had sought with humility and supplication in the nights and days, nay more, issued the verdict for and carried out the shedding of His most pure blood? The cause of this loss and the reason for this ruination was that they regarded not His signs and verses with their own hearing and sight, but were captive to the idle fancies of the former divines. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye God. Behold His signs with His eye, then hear His verses with His ear. By the life of God! Had there been a soul worthy of mention, this Wronged One would not have borne the tribulations of the world for the sake of manifesting the Cause. Where, at last, hath fairness gone, and what hath become of justice? Through a brackish drop they deprived themselves of the Euphrates of mercy and were forbidden from the ocean of bounty. With the hand of power, rend ye asunder the veils, that perchance ye may attain unto the splendors of the light of the Day of God. The former people clung to names and were deprived of their Owner. Ye too have followed that people and count yourselves among the people of the Bayan. Say: We bear witness that the Bayan is innocent of you and of what ye say and do. Hear ye My counsel, then return unto God. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Merciful.</p>

<p>O thou who art wronged! We have heard how thou hast praised God, and how thou hast called upon God, and how thou hast communed with God. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, and He is the All-Seeing, and He is the All-Informed. With Him is the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be. Let not the oppression of princes grieve thee. Be patient even as thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, was patient. We were with thee and heard what thou didst speak concerning God, and We saw what befell thee in the path of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Loving. Grief lieth not in what befalleth bodies, but in what befalleth spirits from those who speak according to their desires and claim what God hath not permitted them in His guarded Book. They are those who profess faith in God in the morning, yet in the evening deny the Lord of the seen and unseen. Grieve not because of imprisonment. Know thou its station. God hath made it the Most Exalted Paradise for thee and for those with thee among the people of Baha, and a prison for those with thee who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He believed in God, then disbelieved and denied after having confessed. Thy Lord beareth witness to this in this praiseworthy station. He will deliver thee and He will save thee, as a grace from His presence. He is verily the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Adorn thyself, adorn thyself, O Beauty! Be patient, be patient. The ultimate victory belongeth to those who were patient in God and followed His forbidden path. Look not at the people and their oppression, but at the mercy of God which hath preceded all who are in existence. Then act according to what We have commanded thee, and forget not what We caused thee to hear through the tongue of might and power when thou wert standing before the Throne, nor what We counseled thee therewith. This is verily the wisdom sent down in Our preserved Book. None may speak concerning thee except with kindness. Thus hath the matter been decreed aforetime and in this blessed hour.

<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with this Tablet which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. When thou attainest unto it, arise and take it with the hand of submission, then inhale from it the sweet-scented fragrances of the garment of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Then turn with thy heart toward the Most Great Scene, this Spot wherein hath been established the throne of the Lord of Destiny. Say: O my Lord! Praise be unto Thee for having made Thyself known unto me and turned me toward the direction of Thy gifts and favors. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all who are in the heavens and on earth, to grant me from the cups of Thy bounty that which will make me steadfast in Thy Cause and vocal in Thy remembrance amidst Thy creatures. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned toward the Dayspring of Thy revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thy inspiration. Look upon me with the glances of Thy loving-kindness, then make me one who is assisted to accomplish what Thou hast desired in Thy Tablets, in such wise that I desire naught save what Thou hast desired and seek naught except what Thou hast decreed, to the extent that I behold my will as extinct within Thy will and my desire within what Thou hast willed and dost will. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty. O my Lord! Draw me by the breezes of Thy days that the wine of the Kawthar of Thy favors may so intoxicate me that I turn neither to the right nor to the left, and remain at all times gazing upon the Beauty that hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy Name, the All-Merciful. Thou art He before Whose power and sovereignty all things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and might every matter hath submitted. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge. Thou givest unto whomsoever Thou willest whatsoever Thou willest. All good is within Thy grasp and in Thy handful. The oppression of the oppressors cannot prevent Thee from what Thou desirest, nor can the veils of them that have disbelieved hide Thee. Assist me, O Thou through Whom the sincere ones have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and reunion, and the hearts of the devoted ones have been consumed in their remoteness and separation from Thee. Ordain for me that which shall profit me in this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the All-Giving, the Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>

<p>O thou who art the fruit of My Tree and the leaf thereof! On thee be My glory and My mercy.</p>
<p>Let not thine heart grieve over what hath befallen thee. Wert thou to scan the pages of the Book of Life, thou wouldst, most certainly, discover that which would dissipate thy sorrows and dissolve thine anguish.</p>
<p>Know thou, O fruit of My Tree, that the decrees of the Sovereign Ordainer, as related to fate and predestination, are of two kinds. Both are to be obeyed and accepted. The one is irrevocable, the other is, as termed by men, impending. To the former all must unreservedly submit, inasmuch as it is fixed and settled. God, however, is able to alter or repeal it. As the harm that must result from such a change will be greater than if the decree had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acquiesce in what God hath willed and confidently abide by the same.</p>
<p>The decree that is impending, however, is such that prayer and entreaty can succeed in averting it.</p>
<p>God grant that thou who art the fruit of My Tree, and they that are associated with thee, may be shielded from its evil consequences.</p>
<p>Say: O God, my God! Thou hast committed into mine hands a trust from Thee, and hast now according to the good-pleasure of Thy Will called it back to Thyself. It is not for me, who am a handmaid of Thine, to say, whence is this to me or wherefore hath it happened, inasmuch as Thou art glorified in all Thine acts, and art to be obeyed in Thy decree.</p>
<p>Thine handmaid, O my Lord, hath set her hopes on Thy grace and bounty. Grant that she may obtain that which will draw her nigh unto Thee, and will profit her in every world of Thine. Thou art the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>Vouchsafe Thy blessings, O Lord, my God, unto them that have quaffed the wine of Thy love before the face of men, and, in spite of Thine enemies, have acknowledged Thy unity, testified to Thy oneness, and confessed their belief in that which hath made the limbs of the oppressors among Thy creatures to quake, and the flesh of the proud ones of the earth to tremble. I bear witness that Thy Sovereignty can never perish, not Thy Will be altered. Ordain for them that have set their faces towards Thee, and for Thine handmaids that have held fast by Thy Cord, that which beseemeth the Ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace.</p>
<p>Thou art He, O God, Who hath proclaimed Himself as the Lord of Wealth, and characterized all that serve Him as poor and needy. Even as Thou hast written: “O ye that believe! Ye are but paupers in need of God; but God is the All-Possessing, the All-Praised.” Having acknowledged my poverty, and recognized Thy wealth, suffer me not to be deprived of the glory of Thy riches.

Hold fast to the cord of steadfastness and place your trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Should some cawing one come to you with satanic tidings, leave him behind you, as bidden by God, the Mighty, the Wise. All must remain steadfast and firm in the Cause of the Beloved of all possibility with the utmost joy and fragrance, in such wise that the opposition and objection of the people of the world shall not debar them from the straight path. Strive ye, that ye may attain unto that which is the cause of the perpetuation of remembrance. This is the counsel of the Wronged One to His loved ones. O Jalal! Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord, speaking His praise, soaring in the atmosphere of His love, and acting according to that which hath been sent down in My Wise Book.

Night and day I have been beseeching and hoping from God - exalted be His glory - and waiting that He might manifest from His all-embracing bounty concerning thee that which would bring joy, delight and gladness to thy heart.

Today from the waves of the ocean of knowledge, and the rustling of the Tree of divine wisdom, and the murmuring of the waters of life, the word “The Truth hath come” is heard. We beseech God to assist His servants and guide them to the straight path. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. This Wronged One hath, for the sake of God, accepted the harm of the world for the exaltation of His Word and the revelation of His Cause, until the banner “Verily He is God” was raised by the hand of might to its loftiest station, and the standard “He doeth what He willeth” was planted in the Most Great Prison. Now certain ignorant ones among the people of the Bayan who count themselves among its adherents have arisen in opposition. We beseech God, exalted be He, to adorn His servants with the ornament of justice and fairness. Verily He is the Powerful over what He willeth and doeth what He pleaseth. Mention of you hath been made before the Wronged One, therefore this Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will as a token of grace and bounty, that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful ones. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. By Thy might, O Desire of the world and Adored One of the nations! My heart findeth no rest save in Thy remembrance and praise, and my soul no tranquility except in the light of Thy knowledge. O Lord! Thou seest the hands of hope raised toward the heaven of Thy bounty, and the eye of supplication fixed upon the horizon of Thy generosity and favor. I beseech Thee, by the pearls of the ocean of Thy mercy, to ordain that I may in all circumstances stand firm in Thy service and speak forth Thy praise amongst Thy creatures with wisdom and eloquence. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>

<p>O Ghulam-Husayn, upon whom be the Glory of God, of the people of Sad - He is the All-Seeing Witness</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Qubl-Husayn! Your letter was received and from it We perceived the fragrance of your turning and devotion to the Most Exalted Horizon, and your recognition of the Most Great Word through which every wise matter hath been revealed. We make mention of you and those who have believed. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous One. The Wronged One hath confined matters to the mention of God and His loved ones, such that the scratching of His Pen hath never ceased from the world. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity from His luminous horizon. Blessed is the stranger who hath sought the most exalted homeland, and the thirsty one who hath hastened to the ocean of his Lord’s mercy, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and called all unto the All-Informed One. Among the people are those who believed then denied, and among them are those who turned away when they heard the call of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We counsel all to that whereby the Cause of God and His sovereignty may be exalted, and We aid those who act according to that which they have been commanded in the Book from the presence of an Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>God willing, thou shalt attain unto the reading of the divine verses and remain steadfast in His Cause, in such wise that the Gog of self and Magog of passion - meaning heedless souls - shall not prevent thee from the Dawning-Place of the light of oneness. O Ghulam-Qubl-Husayn! Blessed is the day in which thou wert born, and blessed is the day in which thou didst attain unto this Cause. By the life of God! Those souls who today are firm in the truth are the cause of bounty and blessing to the people of the earth. Although these stations are concealed today, yet they shall assuredly become manifest and evident in the earth. Praise be to the Beloved of the world Who assisted thee and made mention of thee with these sublime words. He is the Powerful, the All-Encompassing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Surrounding.</p>
<p>The chalice of the grace of God, exalted be His glory, appeareth and is made manifest successively. God willing, all shall be enabled to partake thereof.</p>

<p>O Lutfullah! Your name has been mentioned before Us and We have turned toward you from this Scene that you may become aware through your Lord’s loving-kindness toward you and be among those who attain. We have mentioned your name again as a token of Our grace - hearken with the ear of thy heart and inscribe the verses of thy Lord upon the tablet of thy breast. They will protect thee from those who have denied God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou assured of God’s grace - verily He forgets not those servants who have turned toward Him and remembers them as He remembered before. He is indeed the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Thy father attained the presence of the Countenance and won the meeting with his Lord. The grace of thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds, has preceded. Then know that in this land a fire lies concealed - We do not wish to mention it. Soon its flames will become manifest. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. It is not for anyone to turn toward this Scene. It behooveth every soul to be content with the good-pleasure of his Lord and follow the command of his Master with manifest joy. We inscribe for one who has sought his Lord with pure sincerity the reward of those who have attained His presence, for this is a Day whereon mercy has encompassed all things, the banner of grace has been raised, and the standards of bounty have been planted. Blessed is he who has recognized the value of these days and who has drunk therefrom the living waters in the name of his Lord, the Most Merciful. He is assuredly among those who have attained, he is assuredly among those who have arrived. O Hassan! Upon you be the mercy of God and His remembrance, and the loving-kindness of God and His grace. Rejoice in His loving-kindness toward you, then remember Him at all times. O Hassan! We have heard the call of Baqir which was mentioned in thy letter. Convey My greetings to him. Say: Excellent is what thou hast mentioned. He is the Helper of whosoever desires and the Succourer of whosoever wills. Grieve not at the separation. Be content with what We have ordained and be of those who rejoice. We decree naught except with wisdom and We desire naught save what is best for Our loved ones. It behooveth every soul to be content with the decree of his Lord and to be of those who are thankful.</p>

<p>O thou who art beloved of my heart, remembered in my soul, enkindled with the fire of the love of my Lord, speaking His praise and glorification, and arising to serve His Cause! I swear by the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth which hath shone forth from the most exalted horizon of the world that thy mention is remembered, thy effort appreciated, and thy deed accepted. Thy flame ever appeareth manifest and evident before the face of the Ancient King. A hundred thousand blessings and felicitations be upon that honored one, for he hath attained unto that which hath repeatedly been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Tablets. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Goal of the nations, for having manifested from among Thy Afnan one who hath clung to Thy Tree with such firmness that neither all that is in the world nor what is possessed by the peoples can sever him therefrom. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by Thy generosity which hath encompassed all that was and shall be, to ordain for him from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which befitteth Thy grace and bounty. Though I acknowledge, O my God, that my station doth not warrant his mention, for Thou hast related him unto Thyself and remembered him in such wise as none knoweth save Thyself, yet since Thou hast commanded me to love and mention Thy Afnan, I have mentioned him according to my station and capacity. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to accept what my tongue hath uttered concerning them. Verily Thou art the Almighty Who disappointeth not the petitioners. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon him and upon those who are with him and who love him for Thy sake. There is no God but Thee, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! Make your ear ready to hearken unto the call of the One, the Single, and your hem extended to receive the pearls of wisdom and utterance which are cast upon you from the sea of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus does the Wronged One command you from the prison precinct, that you may be of them that act. If you were to discover the fragrance of loving-kindness and favor, you would arise and say: “Thine be the praise, O Lord of Names, and Thine be the grace, O Dawning-Place of Justice, and Thine be the glory, O Lord of all things, and Thine be the bounty, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>
<p>He who bears My name hath appeared before Us, and We make mention of thee through this perspicuous Tablet which summoneth the world with the most exalted call and guideth them to My straight path. We make mention also of My loved ones there who have taken hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and have cast behind them idle fancies and vain imaginings on this Day whereon the All-Merciful hath seated Himself upon the throne of His mighty Name.</p>
<p>O people of God! Know your stations and follow not every ignorant remote one and every iniquitous doubter. This is the Day wherein We have revealed the treasures of inner meanings and utterance and have summoned all unto the All-Knowing One. Among the people are they who have hearkened, heard and hastened, and among them are they who have shown pride before God, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>O people of Kaf! Beware lest ye follow your divines who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament and have pronounced judgment against Him through an injustice that hath rent asunder the heaven of equity and justice. To this beareth witness every discerning scholar. By God! The horizon of possibility hath been illumined by the Luminary of certitude, were ye of them that know. Say: Behold, behold, the ocean is before your faces - advance toward it and follow not every ignorant remote one. Thus hath the Most Great Ocean revealed the pearls of divine knowledge from the presence of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless ones. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon them that are with thee in this Mighty Announcement and this firm, unshakeable Cause.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One dawning from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance. O Muhammad-Before-’Ali! Your petition reached the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God, you have drunk from the choice wine of the utterance of the Goal of all worlds and attained unto the knowledge of God, which is the first cause and greatest reason for the appearance of contingent beings and the manifestation of created things. Your prose and verse were present before Us and the glance of favor was directed toward them. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! The Cause is mighty. In the first step, each of the loved ones who intends the supreme horizon must act according to what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Furqan and hold fast to it - His exalted Word: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain discourses.” And in the second step, with the tongue of nature, turning toward the Kaaba of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, they must utter this blessed word: “I have abandoned the religion of a people who believe not in God and who deny the Hereafter.” We hope that those who seek the ultimate goal and supreme summit will ascend from the realm of names by the ladder of detachment and attain to the heaven of inner meanings. When the attraction of the Call from the Supreme Horizon takes hold of thee, say: “O Creator of heaven and God of the Kingdom of Names! I beseech Thee by the Word through which Thou didst revive all who are in earth and heaven, and by Thy Command through which Thou didst unite all peoples, to make me detached from all else save Thee and steadfast in Thy love, in such wise that names may not prevent me from turning to the court of Thy holiness and entering the depths of the ocean of Thy oneness. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty. Ordain for me in all conditions that which will draw me nearer unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.” We convey greetings to the loved ones and command them to the supreme steadfastness. We beseech God to assist them in what He loveth and pleaseth and to make them among those whom neither the might of the servants nor their strength and power hath prevented from turning toward God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>

Upon thee be the peace of God and His care, and the Glory of God and His mercy! Praise be to God that thou didst arrive in the Most Great Prison and didst attain the presence of the Wronged One in thy comings and goings. And now, by leave and will, thou hast decided to return. Praise the Desired One of the worlds that thou hast attained to that which most are heedless of. Convey greetings and salutations to the friends of God, exalted be His glory. Say: The Wronged One of ’Akka counseleth all to fear God and to that which exalteth the station of man. The true Law of God consisteth in such matters and deeds as are the cause and source of the manifestations of human stations. This is the good that hath been enjoined in all the Books of God, exalted be His glory, and whatsoever is contrary to this station is accounted as evil and must needs be shunned. If thou attainest the presence of the two Names, namely Jamal and Zayn, stand thou before their faces and convey greetings from the Wronged One unto them. Similarly, give thou glad-tidings to the friends of that land through the remembrance of this Wronged One - all are remembered by Him. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid them, draw them nigh and acquaint them with that which beseemeth them. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Some of the friends who are engaged in serving the Cause and are adorned with goodly deeds and praiseworthy character are in truth among the pillars and chosen ones of the earth. The outpourings of divine mercy have been and continue to be especially destined for such souls. Convey greetings to the captives of that land, whether young or old, male or female. In these days the letter of Jinab-i-Zayn and Jinab-i-Mirza ’Abdu’llah was mentioned by this servant in the presence. God willing, a reply will be sent. We beseech God to grant them that which will draw them near unto Him in all His worlds. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Peace and Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have acted according to that which was enjoined upon them by God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Muhammad! O thou who hast turned thy face toward My horizon and hast expended what thou hadst in search of My good-pleasure! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee with that which shall draw thee to a station wherein the sorrows of the world and its conditions and its intimations and its manifestations shall not affect thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Forgiving. Blessed be thy face, for it hath turned toward Him, and thy heart, for it hath attained unto the ornament of the love of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We have known thy sorrow and witnessed thy grief at what hath befallen thee through the decree of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We counsel thee to patience and forbearance. By the life of God! He is in a station wherein hearts rejoice and eyes are gladdened. Were the world to possess any worth in thy Lord’s estimation, He would not have left it to His loved ones. To this testifieth the Preserved Tablet in His presence. We have desired to make mention of him at this time in this Forbidden Place - the Light manifest, resplendent and shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Most High, the All-Glorious. Upon thee, O thou whom the attraction of the love of the Lord of Names hath drawn to the Supreme Horizon! I bear witness that thou didst inhale the fragrance of the Garment and didst seek the Ultimate Goal - the station whereof all the pens of the world are powerless to make mention. Blessed art thou, O thou who wast deemed small by the people but great in the sight of God, the Knower of things unseen. Joy be to him who remembereth thee and visiteth thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. O My Afnan! Sorrows have encompassed Us from every side through what the people possess in manifest wrong. They have cast the Cause of God behind their backs and followed every remote oppressor. They behold the signs of God, yet dispute them; they hear His call, yet turn away from it. They are indeed among the most lost. Will what they possess endure for them, or will their ornaments profit them? Nay, by thy Lord, the Supreme Ruler over all who are in the heavens and on earth! Thus hath the tongue of the Wronged One spoken in this holy, mighty and exalted station. We send Our greetings from this Place to thee and to My Afnan who have remained faithful to God’s Covenant and Testament and who were among the firm ones. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Say: Nay, by Thy glory, except through Thy power and Thy grace which have encompassed all regions. There hath appeared before the Wronged One he who loved Me and made mention of thee.

Ordain for me through Thy Pen that which shall make me mindful of Thy name and a herald of Thy Cause amongst Thy servants.

The way has been barred by that which the hands of the wicked have wrought. How many servants desired to attain the presence but were prevented from attaining unto the throne. For this did the dwellers of the cities of the Kingdom of Names and the denizens of the Concourse on High lament - upon them be My blessings and mercy until the Day that cannot be reckoned by numbers. Blessed are their faces for having turned unto the Face of God, and their hearts for having turned to the Luminary of earth and heaven. How many turned and attained His presence and achieved what God had ordained for them in the Book. For each is a portion from this Most Great Ocean. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Let not distance grieve you. How many servants never attained the presence of the Throne, yet their attainment was inscribed in the Scriptures and Tablets. And how many a servant was in My vicinity yet failed to attain My presence. Thus does the All-Merciful testify in this Tablet from whose horizon has shone the Sun of wisdom and knowledge. Blessed are they who have achieved both. That which shall bring joy to the eyes of creation hath been ordained for them. O My loved ones! When you gather in any spot, remember what befell Me in My days and what I witnessed from those who denied God, the Cleaver of the dawn. Among the people were those who desired to extinguish My light, those who sought to shed My blood, those who openly turned away, and those who said “He hath fabricated lies about God” - after I had come to them from the Dayspring of grandeur and power with might and sovereignty. Soon shall We seize them as We seized the factions of old, and We shall raise up the banners of the Cause as We please. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Compelling. Were it not for My mercy, We would send down chastisement upon them, but We grant them respite, looking to the appointed time. Give thanks then to God for what We have sent down to thee of verses and dispatched unto thee, that thou mayest find what was diffused in the Most Great Scene before the face of thy Lord, the Master of all mankind.</p>

Were it not for Him, the Primal Point would not have spoken, the Dove would not have warbled, the Sperm-drop of Names would not have attained maturity, the gate of heaven would not have opened, the Book of Creation would not have been adorned, the Tablet of Eternity would not have been embellished, the Most Exalted Pen would not have moved, the hearts of the chosen ones would not have soared, the horizon of faithfulness would not have been illumined, the ocean of reunion would not have surged, the carpet of separation would not have been rolled up, and the star of meeting would not have shone forth. Reflect, O people, and follow not him whom you know not. Fear God, then follow your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: This is He Whom the might of the Manifestations of power did not deter and Who was not veiled by the veils of those who arose in hypocrisy.

Be thou detached from all things that have been created in earth and heaven, that thy words may influence the hearts of them that have turned unto the countenance of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and that they may become severed from the manifestations of Satan. Be thou a warner from Our presence and a bearer of glad-tidings from Our side, then rejoice in the gladness of the Cause and grieve not for what hath been ordained for thee of separation. Be content with what God hath ordained for thee, for this is better for thee than all that hath been created in the contingent world. Whoso draweth but a single breath in His Cause and good-pleasure is verily of the dwellers of Paradise. Beware lest thou be saddened by the commandment of thy Lord. Journey through the lands with joy and radiance and remind the people of that which We have imparted unto thee, then recount unto them the story of the Youth as thou hast witnessed it. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command thee from before God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the Help in Peril. Say: O people! The Sun hath shone forth at its noontide zenith. Beware lest ye occupy yourselves with disputation. Purify your hearts from all things, then turn ye unto this Cause which hath appeared from the horizon of bounty. And if thou shouldst see them that have believed in God and find from their faces the radiance of Baha, magnify them from Our presence, then give them the glad-tidings of this Ridvan. Say: God hath written down the names of them that have turned unto Him, and He shall soon send down upon them that which He hath ordained for them. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Glorious. Blessed art thou for having attained the presence of the Countenance and for having won the lights of God and for being content with what He hath ordained for thee, and this is better than all that hath been created in the realm of possibility. And upon thee be glory, and upon them that have set their hearts upon the sanctuary of God and have turned unto Him with humility and contrition.</p>

<p>Avih [Mandilih]. O Muhammad-Qasim, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>From the Most Exalted Fruit of the Divine Tree of the Supreme Pen came this blessed word, which the Dayspring of the Light of Divine Unity spoke aforetime: “Whoso is God’s, God is his.” And this most exalted and glorious station cannot be attained except through recognition of the Manifestation of the divine names and attributes. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this most exalted station, and well is it with him who hath heard the Call and answered his Lord. He is indeed recorded among those who have attained in a mighty Tablet.</p>
<p>Your letter was received and from it were inhaled the sweet fragrances of love and devotion. God willing, through divine grace you shall become a guide to the path and a cup-bearer of the heavenly wine - that is, you shall bestow upon the people, in the name of God, the choice sealed wine which hath been unsealed by the finger of might, that perchance those who slumber may awaken and those who are heedless may turn toward the supreme horizon. This is the Day whose mention hath been recorded in the divine Books of the past and future. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld what hath appeared in truth, and the ear that hath heard this wondrous Call.</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid you to serve His Cause in such wise that you may set ablaze the whole world with the fire of divine love. Verily He is the One Who doeth what He willeth through His word “Be” and it is! Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast subdued all who dwell in the kingdom of creation through the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen! I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of Names, and by the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thine inspiration, to aid me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that my name may endure thereby in Thy Kingdom. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy horizon, acknowledging Thy power and might. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love in such wise that neither the might of princes nor the power of the powerful shall deter me. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the kingdoms of the heavens and earth. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested Himself through a light from the lights of His Most Great Name unto the world, whereupon the earth and heaven were illumined. Exalted be God, the Lord of Names and Possessor of all things, Who hath revealed whatsoever He desired through His word “Be” and it is. And the prayer shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of His grace be upon the Dawning-Place of His light, the Dayspring of His Revelation, the Source of His Command, the Repository of His knowledge, the Mine of His wisdom, the Ocean of His power, the Heaven of His bounty, and the Sun of His generosity - He Who stood in His station in the world amidst all peoples and guided mankind unto the straight path and the mighty announcement. And upon His family and companions, through whom the ark of divine knowledge sailed upon the ocean of certitude and the horizon of utterance was illumined by the luminary of proof. Through them were revealed the mysteries of divine unity, and through them was raised aloft the word of detachment, and through them was hoisted upon the highest standard the banner of “There is none other God but Him.”</p>
<p>And now, he who was named Husayn in the Crimson Tablet by the Supreme Pen hath come forward and attained the presence of the Wronged One in His mighty prison. O Muhammad! Blessed art thou, and blessed is he, and blessed is his mother who hath attained unto the recognition of her Lord, and blessed is the radiance that hath kept company with Me and stood before My face. At this moment We speak while the servant who is present writeth, standing beside My thigh. Verily, in his earliest days he discovered the fragrance of the garment and attained the presence of the Wronged One.</p>
<p>O Mustafa! Upon thee be the peace and glory of God, the Lord of all names. We testify that thou hast attained unto that which most of the servants have failed to attain. Thou didst hold fast unto goodly deeds and didst cleave unto that whereby the Cause of God, the Most High, the Most Great, was exalted. Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from turning toward the Supreme Horizon - they are honored servants, upon whom resteth the loving-kindness of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

He hath made clear the proof and revealed the way, guiding all to His supreme horizon and most exalted summit - the station adorned with the ornament of unity and beautified with oneness.

<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning the travellers: though it be contrary to wisdom, leave hath been granted for a visit of three days. It behooveth them to approach this land with gladness and joy, and to refrain on their journey from speaking to anyone about this Cause. Any mention or teaching of the Cause hath been forbidden in these regions.</p>

The Speaker of the Mount is established upon the throne of grandeur, yet the people remain deprived and forbidden from His presence and meeting. All tongues speak in praise of this blessed Day, all ears are attentive to hear the Call, all books, scrolls and psalms make mention of this most exalted and most holy Revelation, and all eyes are expectant. Yet when the world was illumined with the lights of the dawn of Revelation, all peoples were found heedless and veiled, save whom God willed.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, Who summons thee from the precincts of the Most Great Prison and calls thee to the highest horizon. The people of the world who were seekers, yearning and expectant of the divine Day, are all occupied with these fleeting days and heedless of, nay, turned away from God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained the recognition of God and whose mention hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Most Great Book. He shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Blessed art thou for having attained unto a Tablet that cannot be equaled by whatsoever existeth on earth. Thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, beareth witness unto this.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of Thy knowledge, for having made me recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, for having guided me to Thy path, and for having cast upon me Thy Most Exalted Word. I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of Names to make me steadfast in Thy service, speaking Thy praise, holding fast to the cord of Thy grace, and standing firm in this Cause whereby the limbs of the people of Thy kingdom have trembled. O Lord! Thou art the Answerer and I am the supplicant. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the fragrances of Thy Robe, nor to disappoint me of what lieth with Thee.

Earth and heaven, glory and dominion are God’s, the Lord of all men, and the Possessor of the Throne on high and of earth below!”</p>
<p>Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say:</p>

<p>Let him, then, be seated and say:</p>
<p>I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and that there is none other God beside Thee. Thou hast, verily, revealed Thy Cause, fulfilled Thy Covenant, and opened wide the door of Thy grace to all that dwell in heaven and on earth.

The waves of the sea of utterance have become manifest from the Pen of the All-Merciful in the form of these words: Thy letter was presented before the Throne and the essence of love was evident therefrom, and the fragrance of affection was manifest from it. Well is it with thee for having drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the cup of thy Lord’s grace, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In most of the Tablets mention hath been made of the cawing of the crows and the clamor of the deluded ones, in the days when the Seat of the Divine Throne was in Zawra (Baghdad), and likewise in the Land of Mystery (Adrianople) and the Most Great Prison. We informed the people of that which later came to pass and will yet come to pass. The people of Baha must today be so steadfast and firm in the Cause of God that they should regard all else as non-existent and count it as nothing. All matters have been set forth in detail in the Tablets, such that no excuse remaineth for anyone. Nevertheless, certain souls speak vain words which are but the dregs of the worthless utterances of the dervishes of old, and they glory therein. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of divine unity that such souls have never understood unity, nor have they inhaled the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful. However, thou shouldst not be saddened, for such vain imaginings have always existed in the world and will continue to exist, especially in this Revelation wherein countless such things will appear. God protect us and the company of the sincere ones from these people. God willing, may you ever be engaged in mentioning the Truth with the utmost joy and fragrance. Convey to the loved ones in that land an exalted greeting from the Wronged One, that all may be occupied with serving the Cause and may strive and endeavor that perchance the heedless servants may drink from the Kawthar of the mercy of the Lord of the worlds and attain to the fruit of their existence.

<p>THE MOST HOLY, THE MOST GLORIOUS! Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree in the luminous and most holy spot: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise. By My life! Wert thou to taste the sweetness wherewith the Supreme Pen hath called thee, thou wouldst cast away the world and all that is therein and would delight in the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, in such wise that nothing would prevent thee from His beautiful praise. Then wouldst thou relate unto the earth before the Throne what hath befallen it, and it would speak forth in thy name. We have sent down unto thee the verses and made them clear evidences for all the worlds. Say: This, verily, is the News of which God took covenant from the Prophets and Messengers, and from those who claimed faith within themselves. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise. When thou hast drunk from the Kawthar of eternity and attained unto the lights of guidance which shone forth from the direction of the Tablet, remind the people of the News of their Lord. Say: Verily, it is that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen, concealed within the veil of grandeur, and mentioned in the heart of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. When the days were fulfilled and the promise came to pass, He came with the truth from the kingdom of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: Be fair, O people! If ye deny Him, by what path will ye approach and to what command will ye hold fast? By God! They have no protector save that they repent and return unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: Do ye rejoice in what ye possess while ye behold its passing? Leave it and turn unto the Countenance. This, verily, is the Goal, did ye but know. Verily, those who are heedless are in manifest error. Soon shall they find themselves in the fire - verily, they are the companions of the flame. And those who have cast away the world and turned unto God, the Lord of Names - these are the people of Baha, upon whom the Concourse on High shall pray, and unto whom the denizens of Paradise shall draw near, and thy Lord is witness to what I say. Leave the dead to themselves and enter thou the Kingdom of Life in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless.

O people! Wage not war with anyone, dispute not with any soul, and be ye God’s trusted ones in His earth and His chosen ones in His lands. This is what hath been ordained for you, if ye but act accordingly.

Rejoice within thyself and grieve not over aught, lest sorrow prevent thee from ascending to the heaven which hath been raised up in truth through this Mighty, Powerful Name. Yet wert thou to learn what hath befallen God, thy Lord, sorrow would seize thee; therefore have We concealed from thee in this Tablet what hath befallen Us at the hands of Our idolatrous servants. Weep thou for God, thy Lord, in all matters, then take comfort in His remembrance, for this is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth.

And among them are those who disputed His verses and denied His proof and rose up against Him with swords of hatred that were a thousand times sharper than swords of steel. Thus was the matter decreed by God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Pay thou no heed to these people. Be steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause and place thy trust in God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears of old.

Therefore do the denizens of the Supreme Horizon weep for Me, together with the holy angels.

Through Him all things have been resurrected and all who dwell on earth, whether rich or poor, have been gathered together. Say: By God! He is verily the Sovereign of the Messengers and His Tablet is the Mother of Tablets, and through a single letter from Him was everything created with the ornament of luminous glory. Take thou this Book with power and hold fast to what is therein, and fear no one. Place thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He shall suffice thee against all the worlds, and He doth take account of thee. Open thy sight and ponder what hath been sent down unto thee, and take it with strength that is firmly grounded in truth. Then emerge from behind the veils and arise in the name of God from a holy and resplendent horizon. Aid thy Lord with whatsoever thou art able and remain pure in nature. Know thou that We have been cast into prison through what the hands of the oppressors have wrought - this hath been decreed in truth upon preserved holy tablets. We give thanks to God for what hath befallen Us and remember Him every day, nay every moment and instant. The Spirit and the Glory and the Splendor be upon thee and upon those who were possessed of insight into the Cause, then convey Our greetings to those who were God-fearing in the Name and to those who were with thee, whom God made faithful to the Covenant.</p>

<p>Countenance of love, we have recognized your longing for God in the pavilions of eternity, insofar as you drew near and attained, in the arenas of encounter, to the presence of God. Thus have we reckoned everything in a book that was decreed in the Tablet. Know that you have advanced to the sanctuary of beauty and visited the kaaba of holiness in the garden of paradise on the Mount Paran of love. Thus was your affair guarded from the rebellious in a tablet. Do not grieve over any matter, and be not perplexed at the adversities of this world. God shall send you forth in a station that is, in truth, exalted. For the world, its adornments and finery, shall pass away in less than the blink of an eye. Therefore, exert yourself in what will be everlasting for you in the highest kingdom, so that you will be safeguarded in the worlds of the spirit that revolve around the tree of immortality.</p>
<p>Listen with the ear of your heart to what the dove warbles on the pole of infinity, insofar as it has taught you the paths of truth on that route that was raised up in light. Attest to this Tablet with the tongue of spirit so that you might be radiant with the fire of love. Fear God, and pay no attention to those who opposed him. Do not follow those who have disbelieved and who shall never find for themselves a path to the truth. Be constant in love and firm in the cause so that your foot shall not stumble, even if you are opposed by all who are on earth. Therefore, cast away what is in your right hand, then follow God’s paradise so that you might find an august station at the center of the Garden near the sea of immortality.</p>
<p>Thus have we written in the Tablet the details of all things, and have mentioned them to you so that you might arrive at a station that is impervious to sorrow. By God, if you smell the fragrance of this shirt, you will discover the breezes of the divine essence, your eyes will overflow with tears in your yearning for God, and you will be insightful concerning the cause of your Lord.</p>
<p>Spirit be upon you, and upon those who were meek, having drawn nigh and been consumed by the fire of union.</p>

<p>He is the Mighty! O servant! Hear My call and be not of them that are disturbed in the Cause and are among the losers. I counsel thee to fear God Who created thee by His command and made thee to be of the guided ones. Be patient in all that hath befallen Us and be not dismayed by anything. Therefore, be patient in thyself and be of the patient ones. Say: Verily in the flight of this Bird there are signs for them that are discerning. Say: It hath taken wing from the branch of Iraq, and in its flight ye shall witness signs of tranquility, if ye be of them that know. Say: O people of hatred! Die in your wrath and rejoice not in what hath befallen Us, and be not of them that make merry. For what hath befallen Us is of God’s way that was foreordained for His near servants. Say: God will soon turn your joy to grief, and this is what the All-Merciful, the Compassionate, hath prescribed for Himself. Thus do We impart unto thee that which shall make thee independent of all who dwell in the kingdom. Know thou that after Me the Samiri will bray, whereupon ye shall not turn toward him nor be of them that approach. And the Baal will stir within herself and arise to practice deceit among you, whereupon ye shall turn away from her and be not of them that make mention. Remember God within yourselves, and put your trust in Him, for in Him do His sincere servants place their trust. Say: We were with you and shall be among you, if ye be of them that know. And ye shall behold the beauty of the Cause if ye purify your eyes from the veils of gross pride. O people of the Bayan! Hear My call at the time of departure from the shore of Iraq, and be not of the heedless ones. Be still within yourselves, then find tranquility in the mercy of God, the Mighty, the Merciful. Soon there shall reach you an august missive from One Who is All-Wise, All-Informed. Thus have We taught thee the ways of knowledge and inspired thee with that which shall guard thee from the darts of the evil ones. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon the patient servants of God.</p>

Blessed is he who hath been illumined by its lights! Know thou further that the Youth hath arrived in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought.

The seas of meaning and utterance have surged through the mention of thy Lord, the All-Merciful - these are their sprinklings. Say: When the Youth came, the heaven was rolled up and every soul was summoned according to its deeds. The Tablets have been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Glorious. Blessed is he who hath been attracted by its verses. Grieve not for the Youth. He hath accepted tribulations in the path of God and their hardship doth not dismay Him. Consider those who oppressed aforetime - where are their lofty palaces? Those are their houses, fallen into ruin with their trellises. Say: By my Lord, the Most Glorious! That which was created shall perish even as the kings and palaces perished, and today thou seest not their traces. The Tree of Knowledge hath been planted by the hand of the All-Merciful and soon shall its branches bear fruit. The melodies of God have been raised from the right of the Throne and the unitarians have been attracted by their rapture. Arise to serve the Cause in such wise that the tree of Zaqqum and its branches shall not hinder thee. Say: The Tree hath been raised in truth. Blessed is he who hath been seized by its modes and hath tasted of its fruits. Say: O people! Turn ye to the supreme horizon. By God! The world and its riches shall not profit you. Enter ye the Garden by God’s leave and eat freely of its bounties. The City of Immortality hath been built by the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Most High. Soon shall its gates be opened and thou shalt hear the melodies of the birds of Paradise from its precincts. And glory be upon thee and upon every soul that hath fulfilled its covenant.</p>

Make mention of him who hath turned towards the All-Highest Horizon, that the fragrances of the verses may draw him unto God, the Lord of names and attributes. Behold those who endure hardships for My name, yet when I came unto them with the sovereignty of the Cause, they disbelieved in God, the Manifestation of Revelations. Among the people are those who worship names, and when He Who is named by His Most Glorious Name appeared, they denied the Lord of Lords. When they witnessed what they desired of power, they said: “This is a lying sorcerer,” and when the verses were recited unto them, they said: “This is a doubting impostor.” We have rolled up the heavens of idle fancies, and the earth hath told its tales, yet they remain in wondrous drunkenness. The earthquakes have seized all the tribes save those intoxicated with the wine of joy from the mercy of their Lord, the All-Merciful. When asked “In whom do ye believe?” they say “In Muhammad, the Messenger of God.” Say: Fie upon you and upon those among the factions who follow you! He lamenteth and saith: “If ye believed in My Revelation, why did ye turn away from Him Who sent Me with the signs?” By God! This is He Whose voice I heard though I beheld not His countenance. When the appointed time came, He rent asunder the veils of glory and opened the gate of reunion, yet ye turned away, O people of hypocrisy! We informed you of the appearance of Husayn after the Qa’im. This is indeed the Self-Subsisting, O people of the Book! The Qa’im hath sought shelter beneath His shadow, and then all the Manifestations of the names. Among you are those who turned away and those who hesitated at the gate. Fear God and deprive not yourselves of this bounty whereby eyes are gladdened. Turn ye unto Him, then burn the veils of doubt with the fire of His countenance. It is indeed a light unto the people of the Revelation and a mercy unto all who dwell in the realms of existence. Thus doth the Messenger speak and say: “Blessed is he who heareth and turneth toward the Dawning-Place of lights.” Grieve thou not at anything, but turn with thy heart to the Horizon of all horizons.

He calleth the servants unto the Lord of creation, and the clamor of the polytheists hath not prevented Him from His remembrance. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s favors, then remember Him in thy days. He is with His remembering servants.

Draw ye nigh unto it, then enter therein by leave of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Beware lest the world and its ornaments hold you back from the Lord of Names and from turning unto God, the Mighty, the Wise. Rejoice thou in the remembrance of God, then inhale from His traces the fragrance of the garment. Thus doth command thee He Who hath been imprisoned amidst the heedless ones.

<p>O Ali! Today the Tongue of God speaks in all things, yet no hearing ear is to be found that might perceive it. The signs of God are manifest in all things, yet no seeing eye is found that might behold them. The Cause of God has ever been manifest and radiant, yet people remain immersed in pure delusion and veiled from the Purpose. Consider the peoples of the past - though all were engaged in uttering the praise of God throughout all days and nights with utmost desire and longing, yet at the time of His Manifestation all remained veiled from the Sovereign of the Cause by their own imaginings and were deprived of His divine verses. Now observe the people of the Bayan with this same insight - all recite the Bayan, yet remain veiled from its Revealer. Would that they had been content with this much, but rather they have inflicted upon the Ancient Beauty that which no soul has ever inflicted upon another. Such is the measure of these servants. O Ali! Turn your gaze away from all else but God and sanctify your heart from the mention of aught else. O Ali! Raise up the pavilion of detachment upon the shore of the Most Great Ocean and pitch the tent of trust beneath the shade of the Divine Unity, for there has been and shall be no shelter save His shade. Give thanks to God that the breeze of His grace has ever wafted over you and, God willing, shall never cease. Today most of the people of the earth have risen to dispute with the Beauty of Divine Unity, though they have witnessed with their own eyes in this Revelation that which was never seen or heard in any previous Revelation.

<p>As to what you asked regarding protection from the evil of the oppressors - do not cause corruption in the land after it has been set in order, lest the tyranny of every stubborn oppressor touch you. For if you become corrupt, you will have wronged your own self. And when you become an oppressor, it behooves God to cause another oppressor to gain dominion over you. This is justice from His presence, if you be of those who understand.</p>
<p>As to your asking God to grant you that whereby people wage war against each other, that you might thereby aid your Lord - hear thou that We have lifted the decree of the sword and spear, and have ordained victory through utterance, through that which proceeds from the tongue. He, verily, is the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>As to what you asked about Our instilling in you the courage of a lion - know that We have made the hearts of those who have detached themselves from the world and turned to the court of My Most Glorious Name like blocks of iron, such that nothing in the heavens or earth can cause them fear. They are like lions in the thickets of power and might. God has bound them with the chains of protection, and were He to will, He would loose them by His command and through them subjugate all who are in the heavens and earth. He, verily, has power over all things.</p>
<p>As to what you asked about Our making you free in your turning to God, such that whenever you wish you could turn to the holy court - know that in this request you have made yourself a partner with your Lord, for He is the Free, and He has not taken, nor will He ever take, any partner unto Himself.

We beseech God to grant success that you may be enabled to preserve what He has bestowed. The traces of the Supreme Pen have encompassed the world, yet the deeds and words of the servants have prevented them from the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. O people of Baha!

He is the Powerful One whose aid has never been withheld from His loved ones, and His favors have been and shall ever be with them that are near and sincere. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of My utterance and soared in the atmosphere of My nearness and love, say:</p>

Then I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, by the Most Great Name through which the limbs of the polytheists trembled and the hearts of the transgressors were disturbed, to ordain for me from the Pen of Thy Command that which will keep me firm upon Thy path.

<p>He is the Mighty! These are the verses of the Spirit which have been sent down upon the Pen of Eternity from God, the Exalted, the All-Wise. Therein is that which causeth the hearts of them that circle round the Throne to take flight. And thou, O Muhammad, hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from this hallowed and luminous Quarter, that there is none other God but Him, the Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. There hath been decreed for them that are nigh unto God that which causeth the hearts of the sincere ones to tremble. Be thou assured by that which We have cast upon thee of the Spirit, and fear thou no one. Put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Powerful. He will guard thee by His command and protect thee by His grace from these wrongdoers. Then know thou and be certain that all who are in the heavens and on earth are, in God’s sight, as but a handful of clay. He doeth what He willeth by His command, as He did in truth while ye were witnesses. He will do what He desireth by His wisdom and seize these idolaters by His might. Nothing hath delayed this save that which hath preceded it in knowledge in a preserved Book which none hath comprehended save God, the Single, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And when thou hearest that the Lamp of Hijaz hath left the Niche of Iraq, grieve not, for therein lie mighty secrets. It will shine resplendently within another globe, as predestined by Him who is the Omnipotent, the Ancient of Days. Through this God’s Cause shall be exalted in the Word of God, and thereby shall the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, be upraised. Say: This servant feareth no one, even should all the kings of the earth and all who are behind them rise up against Him, for We desire for Ourselves naught save what God desired for Us before the creation of the heavens and earth. He who desireth God will desire naught else besides Him and will fear none other than Him. Our deeds bear witness to this, and beyond them these verses, the understanding of which bewildereth the minds of the mystics. Erelong will ye behold this Divine Youth riding upon the steed of victory. Then will the hearts of the envious be seized with trembling.</p>

<p>O Ramadan! The Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious! These are the verses of God, the King, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful. They have been sent down from the heaven of Revelation unto him who hath believed in God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. The gates of heaven have been opened, and the Lord of Names hath come with sovereignty and power. The appointed time hath come, and He Who is the Possessor of Names and Attributes hath appeared. This is what ye were promised in the Book. O people! This is He through Whom faces have been illumined and eyes have been gladdened. He hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities for your salvation. Fear ye God, O ye who are endued with insight! Cast away what ye possess and turn with your hearts toward the Focal Point of the Beloved. Thus have ye been commanded in the Books of your Lord, the Creator of all things. Blessed art thou for having cast away what the people possess, turning unto God, He Who causeth the rivers to flow. Be thou thankful unto Him for having aided thee to love Him and for having adorned thee with the ornament of His remembrance amongst His servants. Say: O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having made known unto me the Manifestation of Thy Self, the Dayspring of Thy verses and the Source of Thy laws, after He was denied by those servants who deemed themselves to be amongst the learned ones in the midst of Thy servants and the mighty ones amongst Thy creatures. By Thy glory, O my God! Were I to sacrifice my life in Thy path in return for what Thou hast bestowed upon me through Thy grace, it would still be little compared to the manifestations of Thy gifts and favors. O Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love and then cause me to stand firm in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon her who was with thee. Convey unto her face the greetings from thy Lord, the Lord of all days.</p>
<p>O servant! Consider the divine favor and reflect upon the infinite outpourings of thy Lord. He hath guided thee and led thee to the shore of the Most Great Ocean, and now thy name is mentioned in the Supreme Concourse while the names of those who considered themselves the most learned of the learned are unmentioned. Thus have We made their highest ones lowest and their lowest ones highest. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>

<p>These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of exalted glory and which call the people to the recognition of His Self, the Most High, the Supreme, the All-Knowing. O handmaiden of God! Hearken unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee at this time when He hath seated Himself alone in the house, His gaze fixed upon His loved ones, His tongue speaking in remembrance of His Self, the ocean of His heart surging with the verses of His grandeur, and the ink of His pen flowing in praise of His handmaidens who have turned with their whole being unto this Wronged One, the Stranger, the Alone. Give thanks unto God for having deposited within thy heart His love and for having purified thee from the defilement of those who have denied His Self and opposed that which hath been sent down from His presence. By God! Through what they have perpetrated the hearts of those near unto God have been consumed. O My handmaiden! Soar with the wings of My love in the atmosphere of My mercy and bounty, then drink the wine of everlasting life from the hands of My grace, then sing My praise and glorification, then be ignited with the fire of My love, then detach thyself from all else save Me, and know that thy Lord loveth him who loveth Him, desireth him who desireth Him, remembereth him who remembereth Him, draweth nigh unto him who draweth nigh unto Him, and provideth the heavenly feast unto him who seeketh sustenance from His all-pervading grace. He verily forgetteth not His lovers, disappointeth not those who hope in Him, and driveth not away those who long for Him. His mercy hath indeed encompassed all created things, yet the people are heedless. O My handmaiden! Take comfort in My remembrance, then adorn thy tongue with My praise, thy head with the crown of My love, thy neck with the cord of My servitude, thine eyes with the kohl of detachment from all else save Me, and thy body with the robe of My loving-kindness which hath encompassed all worlds. Thus have We remembered thee on this night that thou mayest rejoice within thyself, though thy Lord be in grievous sorrow. And glory be upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have turned with their hearts unto My countenance, the radiant, the shining, the gleaming, the hallowed, the beautiful.</p>

<p>This is a Tablet to Mir Muhammad-’Ali. He is the Mighty. These are the verses of holiness, set forth with pure nature, and He casts forth remembrance and guidance. Verily, in the remembrance of God do hearts find rest. Nothing escapes His knowledge, and nothing is hidden from God, thy Lord. There is no God but Him. His is the Command and Creation, and all return unto Him. Is there any god besides God? Say: Glory be to God! There is no God but Him, and all beseech His bounty. His is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and earth. He creates what He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Say: O people, fear God with true fear, and associate not anything with Him, and call not upon any god besides God, and take not your vain desires as lords unto yourselves, if ye be aware. Verily He sufficeth you against all things, while nothing can suffice against God your Lord, and unto Him do all return. With Him is the knowledge of all things, and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and He knoweth your final home and resting place, and whatsoever people imagine within themselves. Say: Fear God, O people, and turn not your faces from the holy sanctuary, then follow what the Spirit casteth upon you, that ye may draw nigh with your hearts to the shore of nearness, and then attain certitude of this Beauty. Thus doth the Dove counsel you with true counsel and remember you with the best remembrance, if ye but hear. O servant! Remember thyself, then remind the people of what God hath taught thee of His grace, then make thy heart a mirror wherein this hidden and radiant Beauty may be reflected. Grieve not over anything that befalleth thee, but place thy trust in God, then strive in His good-pleasure, and be not of those who in the days of the Spirit are sorrowful. The Spirit and Light be upon thee and upon whosoever hath turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O Afnan, upon whom be the peace of the All-Merciful! Thou hast repeatedly attained Our presence - praised be God! - and art mentioned before the Wronged One and hast been the recipient of special favors. With complete determination thou must endeavor to guide all people and, through the Most Great Name, conquer the hearts of all who dwell on earth. This is not difficult for God to accomplish. The assault of the oppressors and the clamor of the malicious ones have somewhat subdued the friends in various lands. We cherish the hope that through the light of the Manifestation of Him Who conversed with Moses and through the fire of the Blessed Tree, the world will be set ablaze. O Afnan! Upon thee be My glory! Your station is to guide the servants, that those who turn to God may drink from the hand of bounty the water of everlasting life and thereby quicken the world. Through God’s grace - exalted be His glory - thou art mentioned and recorded in the Book as one of the Afnans of the Tree and as one of the Hands of the Cause. The flowing blood of the martyrs will surely awaken the world and its peoples. By God’s life! None can reckon its effects and manifestations; pen and ink cannot venture into that realm. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make known to the oppressors what they have wrought in this transient world and to bring them near to the punishment that hath been ordained for them in this world and the next. We remember all the friends in that land and beseech God on behalf of each one that which will cause the exaltation of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Thou didst mention Muhammad. Praise be to God, he hath attained recognition and is illumined by the light of understanding. We beseech God to ordain for him that which will cause him to speak His praise, to arise to serve Him, and to turn his gaze toward His horizon. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer of prayer. May glory and light rest upon his father, who attained My presence time and again, and upon every steadfast and trusted one. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of the All-Knowing Speaker! Some time ago in a letter from this servant, mention of you was revealed from the Most Exalted Pen. God willing, you will drink the choice wine of the Merciful’s bounty at all times and remain focused on its horizon. Through God’s special favors you have aimed for the ultimate goal and attained that which was in the divine Books of the past and future. This is the Day which all the Prophets and Messengers gave glad tidings of to the people and announced. Blessed is he who heard and turned and attained, and woe to every heedless doubter. Strange are those souls who consider themselves believers in the Book yet remain heedless of and turn away from the Mother Book. They speak according to their desires and say that which none before them have said. Your Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, bears witness to this. Thank God for having caused you to hear and recognize and enabled you to make mention of this Remembrance at Whose appearance all remembrances were struck with terror, as attested by Him Who has proclaimed that there is no God but Me, the Manifest, the Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God willing, you will at all times be occupied with assisting the Cause of God, exalted be His glory, and move according to His will and purpose. By God’s life! You have attained unto a word that cannot be equaled by the treasures of earth nor by that which is with the kings and rulers. Today, whosoever has attained to divine remembrance has come to possess a jewel whose worth and value the people of creation are powerless to reckon. Preserve it and say: Yours is the praise, O Lord of Names, and Yours is the glory, O Creator of heaven! I beseech You by the sovereignty of Names to assist me in Your remembrance and praise and in aiding Your Cause amongst Your servants. Then establish for me and my family a station in the shade of the Tree of Your grace. You are He to Whose power all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and might all contingent beings have borne witness. There is no God but You, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station of grandeur and power!</p>
<p>How excellent is he who arises to reform the world, holding fast to the lamp by which earth and heaven were illumined. And peace and blessings be upon the Seal of the Prophets and upon the Hands of the Cause and Dawning-places of wisdom who took no protector or helper for themselves besides Him.</p>
<p>On this night, which is the night of the revered month of Sha’ban, the letter of the spiritual friend Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad, upon him be God’s peace, was presented before the face of the Master and achieved the honor of being heard. And afterwards this utterance emerged from the Dayspring of knowledge:</p>
<p>“O Nuru’llah! Upon you be His peace and grace. Jinab-i-’Ali-Muhammad has sent a letter to this servant and desired that you give attention to his matter, that perhaps through these means he may find rest. Therefore you should not neglect whatever lies within your power regarding him and should carry it out. We counsel him and his father to preserve the station of the Afnan there. From this deed, the door of blessing shall be opened before his face. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His firm and inevitable command.”</p>
<p>We send greetings to the friends of that land and counsel them with that which will raise their stations. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

<p>It is most clear and evident that whatever lies within the power of that kind friend, he will not withhold from the friends and will carry out with the utmost joy and fragrance whatsoever is the cause of blessing and bounty and ease. I send greetings to Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Akbar and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad and to their family members, upon them be God’s care and mercy, and I beseech from the Kingdom of divine favor an everlasting bounty for each one. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Peace be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>In My Name, through which the ocean of utterance surgeth and the fragrance of the All-Merciful is wafted!</p>
<p>O Mirza Hasan, upon thee be the Most Glorious Glory of God!</p>
<p>Praise be unto the King of earth and heaven Who hath adorned the world of existence with the Most Exalted Word, and raised aloft the banner of “He doeth what He willeth.” Neither the might of princes nor the oppression and ignorance of divines could prevent Him from mentioning the Most Sublime Horizon. Exalted is His dominion, His proof, His testimony and His sovereignty! This is the Day wherein the Divine Lote-Tree hath spoken before all mankind, yet the people remain behind a thick veil. Say: By God! The Day hath come, yet the people are in manifest error. They have taken their vain imaginings and cast aside their Lord - they are truly among the heedless. The call hath been raised from the horizon of Akka, yet most of the people remain in evident remoteness.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! By God’s life, ears and eyes were created to witness and hearken unto that which in these days hath appeared and been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon, yet they find themselves prevented. Their deeds have hindered them and their imaginings have veiled them, and they comprehend not. Previously in one of the Tablets this most exalted Word flowed from the Pen of the Wronged One: “O Son of My Name! Were the entire spiritual realm to be transformed into the power of hearing, one could say it would be worthy to hearken unto this Call that hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon. Otherwise these ears that are defiled with false tales were not and are not worthy to hear.”</p>
<p>Ask ye of God that He may enable all to attain unto that for which they were created. The Call hath been raised in such wise that none hath room for denial. From the beginning of days until now, We have summoned mankind, without veil or concealment, unto that which will draw them nigh, make them aware, exalt them and honor them. The oppression of the world did not become a veil, nor did its harm become an obstacle. When the light of the Cause shed its radiance upon the horizons of the world, certain souls emerged from behind the veil with swords of hatred, intending to strike at the Sun of Truth. Thus did their souls beguile them. By My life! They comprehend not.</p>
<p>For twelve hundred years the people of old clung to names and worshipped the idols of their desires. On the Day of Reckoning there appeared from them that which caused the Most Exalted Pen to weep and the Tablet to lament. From the beginning of Islam until this day, not one of the divines who considered themselves the guides of the people and guardians of God’s Law was aware of the nature of His Revelation. Now it is incumbent upon that honored one and the sanctified, assured souls to protect the helpless servants, lest they again become afflicted with the vain imaginings of old. This Wronged One hath borne all tribulations for the purification of hearts and sanctification of souls, that perchance they may attain their purpose and not remain deprived of the fruits of the Blessed Tree which hath been raised before the faces of all in the world.</p>
<p>Today the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is raised and the flowing of the celestial Kawthar is heard, yet most of the servants remain heedless and veiled. Throughout nights and days they built cities with hands of fancy and conjecture, spoke of certain souls, and all people waited for these mentioned matters to appear, considering their success and prosperity to lie in the manifestation of imaginary forms. The people were thus occupied with these inventions, and when the dawn of Revelation broke and the lights of the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of God’s Will, all turned away save a few of the companions of the revered Shaykh, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. Would that they had been content with that! But finally the divines of various lands, together with their followers, arose to […]</p>
<p>When the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of God’s Will, all turned away save a few companions of His Holiness the Sheikh - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Would that they had been content with that! But finally the divines of the land, together with their followers, gave voice to cursing and execration, and moreover issued a decree for the shedding of His most pure blood. The purpose of these utterances is that you should arise, for the sake of God, to do that which will preserve the servants from the suspicions of the prevaricators and calumniators. Now again a group is occupied with forming a party like the party of before. We beseech God to preserve His servants from their suspicions and imaginings and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily He is powerful over all things. Today the Mother Book is manifest and speaking, having counseled the world, both past and future, with utmost clarity, and uttereth these manifest and decisive verses: “O Concourse of Divines! Set down your pens, for lo, the Most Glorious Pen hath moved in the Most Exalted Horizon. Cast aside what ye have composed with the hands of fancy and vain imagination. By God, the Truth! The gate of knowledge hath been opened by the key of certitude, and this is verily a Book sent down by the All-Merciful as a grace from Him - and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.” And likewise concerning the kings, this most exalted Word and greatest Verse was revealed: “O Concourse of Kings! The King hath come and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.” And with these decisive verses did We summon all. He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance.</p>
<p>The Light of Lights hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of mysteries upon the Most Hidden Secret and the Secret veiled by Secret, which appeared in the form of the upright Alif in the preamble of the Most Great Book after the letters Ba and Ha, witnessed in truth. By it the spheres of inner meaning and utterance have revolved, and the All-Merciful hath been established upon the throne of proof, revealing that which had been justly concealed from sight. Blessed are they who have soared on the wings of certitude in this atmosphere, from whose rushing winds can be heard: “He Who was promised hath come with a sovereignty that was inscribed by the Pen of the All-Bountiful in the Mother Book in truth!”</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! Cast aside your books and pens, for the Mother Book hath appeared at the final goal before the faces of the parties, and the Pen speaketh with wisdom and utterance, moving in remembrance of those for whom was revealed in the Qayyumu’l-Asma that which drew unto itself the heart of him who was mentioned in truth before the Face in the Most Hidden Secret.</p>
<p>Thus have We brought forth from the treasuries of Our Most Exalted Pen the pearls of remembrance and praise upon the waves of My knowledge, which hath been witnessed before all eyes without any veil. Behold, O people of Baha, His greatest signs, then aid Him with the hosts of justice and equity, and be not of those who have been justly deprived of the ocean of grace.</p>
<p>Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen rent asunder the veils of the peoples of creation and caused them to hear that which draweth them nigh unto a station that transcendeth understanding. Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses and revealed the clear proofs and made known to His servants His Most Great Announcement, whereby the hearts of the nations were stirred, save those rescued by the hand of power with a sovereignty that encompassed all worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people of mystical knowledge! By God, the heaven of idle fancies hath been cleft asunder and the All-Merciful hath come with a Cause before which neither the hosts of earth nor of heaven can stand. To this beareth witness the Mother Book, before which have bowed the necks of those who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from a cup that was witnessed upon the throne of light before the Manifestation.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, gazeth upon My countenance, and standeth in service to My Cause! Hear My call time and again. Verily thy Lord hath been with thee and hath mentioned thee in such wise as shall endure throughout the dominion of earth and heaven. To this doth the Tongue of Grandeur bear witness. Verily, He is wise over all things.</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is the Ocean of knowledge unto all who are in creation, and the Most Great Book among the nations, and the Salsabil of praise unto the people of creation, and the choice wine of utterance for all religions. Blessed is he who hath cast aside idle fancies, turned with the power of certitude, and believed in God, the Lord of all parties.</p>
<p>Say: O peoples of the earth! The Divine Lote-Tree calleth out in truth: Fear God and be not of the heedless. Beware lest that which the people possess prevent you. Cast it behind you, turning unto God, the One, the All-Informed. He hath come with verses that none deny save those who have turned away from the truth on a day wherein every learned one and every well-informed mystic hath advanced toward Him. By God’s life! That which ye possess shall profit you not. To this doth God’s Most Exalted Pen bear witness from its lofty station.</p>
<p>Hearken, O peoples of the earth, unto that which hath been raised from the direction of the Prison, then behold what hath shone forth and appeared from this luminous horizon. The breeze of grace hath wafted, and the Temple of Justice proclaimeth before the faces of all who are in the heavens and earth: Have mercy upon yourselves and follow not every obstinate oppressor. Say: Look with the eye of justice upon the Divine Lote-Tree and its fruits, upon the Tablets and their verses, upon the Books and their mysteries, upon the sea and its waves, upon the light and its effulgence, and be not of the heedless.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! After Our departure from the Land of Ta, We exhorted the people of God by day and by night to observe what is good and shun what is evil, until swords were converted into ploughshares. Now nigh upon forty years have elapsed during which hostilities and conflict have ceased, to such degree that in certain cities, when they were slain they slew not in return. Prior to these forty years, as thou knowest and hast heard, battles took place every year wherein multitudes of souls were slain. All things bear witness that this Wronged One hath acted in a manner which hath conduced to the welfare and protection of the peoples of the earth. Yet neither the nation nor the government hath become aware or taken notice thereof. Some time ago a grievous event occurred in ’Ishqabad when one of the loved ones of God was martyred in such wise that the effects of his martyrdom influenced foreign powers. None among this party rose up in retaliation or sought to exact vengeance. Rather, they interceded for the murderer. Nevertheless, it is observed that the malice of the opposers hath waxed greater than before. Glory be to God! Justice hath become like the phoenix, non-existent, and the sun of equity hath remained hidden beneath the clouds of tyranny. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants to return unto Him and to repent before the gate of His bounty. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you and upon those with you, and upon everyone who is steadfast and firm, and upon everyone who is established and faithful.</p>

Blessed are they who have arisen to serve and have attained the waters of steadfastness. This is the Day of steadfastness and utterance. Beseech ye God, glorified be His majesty, that He may enable all to attain His special grace and bestow upon them a portion from the spring of assurance. In truth I say, this is the Day wherein whosoever wishes may attain whatsoever he desires. O thou who drinkest from the cup of My love! Strive that perchance the people of that land may attain such a station wherein the cawing of the polytheists and the hints of the deniers may not prevent them from the truth. The evil ones have been and are lying in wait with utmost cunning, and in the name of truth have prevented and continue to prevent the people from the highest horizon. Thus doth the Pen command thee from the presence of God, the Lord of eternity, and give thee glad tidings of that which He hath ordained for thee in His kingdom, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have cast aside all else but Me and chosen My straight path. Say: O people of Baha! Give thanks for having been mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur while He was imprisoned among the heedless. He hath appeared with the truth and revealed what He desired as a grace from His presence. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. Rejoice, O servant Before Mercy, that the face of the Beloved hath turned toward thee and mentioneth thee with that which shall endure through the eternity of My most beautiful names.

Peace be upon thee and the mercy of God.</p>

Mention was made of the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be God’s peace, favors and bounties. Praise be to God, he too attained mention from his Lord, as the letter was presented before His presence. He said: “God willing, divine confirmations and merciful outpourings shall encompass him and the hand of divine power shall assist him. Verily He has power over all things.” End quote. This servant also conveys greetings and praise to him and beseeches from God that which leads to the elevation of station. Similarly I send greetings to Qurratu’l-’Ayn Husayn Effendi, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s peace. God willing, may he ever dwell in perfect health under the shadow of God’s Name.

<p>O Shaykh Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God! In the name of the All-Wise Judge! In this Most Great Revelation most of the loved ones have been commanded to teach the Cause of the Lord of Names, that is, teaching has become obligatory upon all, so that perchance all the friends of the All-Merciful may attain to that exalted and most glorious station expressed in the words “Whoso quickeneth a soul is as though he had quickened all mankind.” However, all must observe wisdom in the matter of teaching. Without it, it is neither permissible nor allowed. For instance, if today someone were to call out at the top of their voice commanding people to rend asunder their imaginary veils, such a soul would not be considered among the teachers in the sight of God, for they would have acted outside the bounds of wisdom. For when someone has spent years following a way and has been brought up in it, one cannot forbid them from it all at once. Rather, one must gradually, with the utmost kindness and mercy, present teachings from their own tradition, so that through these teachings and stories they may attain to the horizon of the Cause and rend asunder their imaginary veils. God’s mercy has taken precedence and His grace has encompassed all. This is why He has commanded all to observe wisdom, lest anything occur that might cause minds and souls to be troubled. Before the martyrdom of Badi’, upon him be the most glorious Glory of God, We commanded a group to call out without concealment or veiling, and they acted according to what God desired and drank the cup of martyrdom from the most exalted of vessels. But after his martyrdom, all have been commanded to observe wisdom. Today, deviation from it is not permitted. Read thou this Tablet to those who have believed in God, that they may be informed of what hath been sent down from the Ancient Revealer. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before the Wronged One, Who hath sent down for thee this wondrous Tablet. Say: All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Your letter was received and read. Praise be to God, it indicated your well-being and good health. Praise be to the Goal of the worlds, Whose mercy and bounty have preceded and made these servants hopeful. Both the disobedient and obedient partake at His table of generosity. His ocean of grace has no shore and His sun of bounty knows no bounds - it shines upon both garden and wasteland. What tongue is capable of giving thanks for these bounties and what heart is worthy to comprehend these stations? From Him do we seek assistance and from Him do we beseech help. In truth, if His grace were to pause, we would all perish. In all conditions, I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may assist you to remember and praise Him and to act in accordance with that which leads to eternal salvation. Praise be to God that we met and renewed our bond of friendship. God willing, may you be enabled to do that which befits servitude before God, the True One. However, this servant did not think that you would remain in Beirut until now, since according to instructions you should proceed to Iraq via Aleppo and from Iraq to Iran. I beseech God to assist you to act according to what has been ordained. God willing, with the utmost joy and fragrance proceed from Iraq toward Iran. As was told to you, we shall write your recommendation to Iran. Be assured. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, has encompassed and continues to encompass all. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist and enable you to do what is right. Verily He is the Most Wise of judges and the Most Merciful of the merciful. There is no God but He, the King, the True One, the Manifest Justice. Peace be upon you and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>The Peerless Friend, while imprisoned among His enemies, is occupied with remembrance and praise. He has had and has no purpose except the reformation of the world and all that is therein, that perchance the world-consuming sun of ignorant fanaticism may be extinguished and the East and West of the world may become connected and united in all respects. However, the heedless ones and the atheists have prevented this and deprived the servants of the ocean of bounty. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to deliver the servants from their heedlessness and protect them from His enemies and draw them nigh unto Him through His grace and generosity and send down upon them from the clouds of generosity the rains of His mercy. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O Hasan-’Ali! Thy letter was presented before the Wronged One. We heard thy call and have responded with this blessed Tablet, that thou mayest read it and be of the thankful ones. In the Tablets We have commanded all to observe wisdom, and wisdom consists in such deeds and character as will cause the attraction and drawing nigh of the servants. However, some have committed that which was not befitting the divine days. We counsel thee to manifest such deeds and character as will cause the exaltation of the station of the servants. Hearken unto the counsel of the Wronged One. Verily He will assist thee through His grace, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Return to thy locality is not permitted in these days. Remain for a time in another place, placing thy trust in God, until God bringeth thee tidings from His presence - a command from His presence. Say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the shell of the sea of Thy bestowal and the breaths of Thy revelation and the nobility of Thy days to protect me from the evil of Thine enemies. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and holding fast to Thy cord. Ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and protect me from the evil of Thine enemies. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs. There is no God but Thee, the All-Merciful, the All-Forgiving.</p>

<p>The Command is from the Mighty One, the remembrance of God, at a time when the breezes of separation blow upon all who are in the heavens and earths. Verily it is a revelation from God, the Lord of the worlds. O Baqir! We have heard the cry of thy heart and the lamentation of thy soul, and We were well aware thereof. And by this We were grieved in such wise as none knoweth save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Therefore did We open unto thy face the gates of counsel that thou mightest be counseled by God’s counsel and be of the patient ones. Be patient, O servant, in this firmly established and mighty decree. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, then commit thy affairs unto Him, for He is the best of helpers and protectors. Though in this separation the pillars of the unitarians be demolished, yet patience therein is nearer unto righteousness, if ye be of those who know. But O My loved ones! Remember My exile, then My tribulation thereafter, then My migration due to what the hands of the hypocrites have wrought. Then ponder upon My reunion, then upon My melodies, then upon My beauty, then upon My majesty, if ye be of those who know. For in all these nothing is seen save the attributes of God, the Mighty, the Ever-Living, the All-Knowing. Thus do We teach you the ways of wisdom that ye may be among the triumphant. Then make mention of Abdullah Ahmad and give him the glad tidings of a mighty victory. O Ahmad! Give thanks unto God for having guided thee unto His Self and nourished thee from the freshly-plucked fruits of holiness and brought thee near unto the shore of nearness and caused thee to hear the sweet and holy melodies and accepted thee and thy brother and assisted you both in His service through what ye fashioned with your hands for His servant. And this hath been inscribed in a Tablet wherein the deeds of the doers shall not be omitted by so much as a date-stone’s weight or a whit. Soon shall appear in the earth the recompense of what ye have done, and verily He rewardeth His sincere servants. Then make mention from Us unto those who are in your households, both young and old, and unto those women who were among the devout before God.</p>

Make mention of thy Lord’s mercy unto His servant that he may be of those who remember and that his eyes may be consoled by the traces of God his Lord, and be of those who have attained unto the recognition of God and the Manifestation of His Self, and whom the denials of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God and were of the heedless did not hinder. O servant! Illumine thy sight with the verses of thy Lord and thy heart with the remembrance of His Name, the Most High, the Most Great. Deprive not thyself of the grace which hath preceded all created things and for whose appearance the Temples of the Cause waited in centuries past. Say: He hath appeared in human form. Blessed be God, the Revealer of this noble countenance. Beware lest anything sadden thee or any matter prevent thee from the upraised and straight path of God. Turn not unto the world and what hath been created therein, but seek what thy Lord hath ordained for thee. Verily He sufficeth thee and sufficeth all worlds. Drink from the Kawthar of life from the spring which floweth in this paradise, that it may attract thee to the face of thy Lord. Verily He is the Mighty, the Generous. He will never withhold from any soul the wonders of His grace nor cut off from His servants the rains of His mercy. There is no God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the heaven of eternity that thou mayest follow the command of thy Lord and be of the doers of good. Verily those who were heedless of the meeting with their Lord and turned away from His beauty - these God will never show mercy to in this world, and in the next world they shall have grievous punishment. Soon shall the angels of chastisement return them to their abode - what an evil abode for those who turned away! Thus have We expounded the verses unto thee and set them forth as a grace from Us upon thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. The Spirit and Glory be upon thee and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>This is a mention from Us to the servants of the All-Merciful who have believed in God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower, in days wherein the Sun of Grandeur and Power hath shone forth, the moon been eclipsed, and the Balance set up, that the Call of God might draw them to the Dawning-Place of Revelation and detach them from all else. Be thou severed from all save Him in the path of God, then turn with thy heart toward the quarter from which the lights have shone forth. We have indeed sent down verses unto thee before - these once again - that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord at eventide and at dawn. Let nothing grieve thee. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord. He hath verily appeared with the truth, and before Him the Spirit proclaimeth: “The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Chosen!”</p>
<p>Behold him who fabricated lies against Us - God seized him with power and authority. Then he who claimed sovereignty for himself - God seized him for his sin and made him a lesson for those possessed of insight. O people! This is He Who hath borne all tribulations for your salvation. If ye will not help Him, at least oppose Him not. Fear God Who hath caused the dawn to break and subjected the winds. None can draw breath save by His leave. Thus hath the Command been sent down in the Book from the presence of One mighty in bestowal. He protecteth whom He willeth through His sovereignty and chastiseth those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of lords. Say: Protection lieth in God’s hands - He protecteth whom He willeth, even were he in the serpent’s mouth. Those whom this world hath deluded shall soon find themselves in the fires.</p>
<p>How many generations did We send Messengers unto, but they denied the signs of their Lord. We seized them for their sins and left them as a reminder for those possessed of understanding. Blessed art thou, O thou who hast turned to God after the servants turned away from Him. Turn thy face toward the Prison, the seat of thy Lord. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs. I beseech Thee by Him not to shut me out from Thy door, then make me steadfast in Thy love and good-pleasure. Thou art verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>

<p>O Ayat! Upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the All-Knowing Rememberer. This is a remembrance from Us unto him who hath turned with his heart unto God, the Lord of all worlds. O Ayat! The Sign of God hath appeared, yet the people have turned away therefrom, and they are among the lowly ones. The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined and the Dawn of utterance hath broken forth, yet most of the people remain heedless. The verses have been sent down and the clear tokens have been revealed, and He Who conversed on Sinai calleth aloud from the Branch of appearance, yet the people are in evident doubt. Blessed is the strong one whom the might of the divines hath not weakened, and the steadfast one whom the allusions of the idolaters have not caused to sit. Whenever the Light appeared and He Who conversed on Sinai spoke forth, the divines rose up against Him with such tyranny as caused the Faithful Spirit to lament. Say: This is the Day wherein that which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen and mentioned in the hearts of the Messengers hath appeared. We have remembered thee, and do remember thee at this time, with the verses of God, the True King, the Manifest. Arise in the Cause in such wise that neither the veils of the world nor the doubts of those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praised, shall hold thee back. We counsel thee with that whereby the Word of God shall be exalted throughout all else. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Counselor. Grieve not over anything, but trust in all matters in God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Thou didst stand before all faces in days wherein the pillars of the servants were shaken by the power of those days. When the Cause was made manifest, the manifestations of vain imaginings emerged from behind the veils and perpetrated that which neither Pharaohs nor tyrants had perpetrated. Thus did their souls entice them, and today they are among the companions of the fire. By the life of God! The dwellers of the cities of justice and fairness, and they who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide, have lamented their deeds. Thus hath the Treasury of Knowledge revealed the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Blessed art thou in that thou hast attained thereunto in the days of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. The Glory be upon thee and upon whomsoever remaineth steadfast in this Mighty Announcement. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

From the Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Glorious, a mention from Us to him who hath attained unto the Most Great Remembrance, when there was sent down unto him from the Lord of eternity that which consoled the eye of understanding and illumined all faces. O My servant! Hearken unto My call from around My throne: He is, verily, none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee. By My life! Nothing descendeth upon the loved ones save that which is best for them. To this beareth witness the Pen of God, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved. Be content with God’s decree. Say: O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I am content with what hath befallen me in Thy days. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Forgiving. Verily, thy father hath ascended unto God, and he is in a praiseworthy station. We have, of a truth, forgiven him as a token of Our grace unto him. Thy Lord is, verily, the Ruler over what was and what shall be. Blessed is he in that his remembrance hath been mentioned by the Pen of the Ancient of Days when the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful, though the people understand not. We had indeed sent down unto him aforetime clear verses which no treasuries of kings could equal. Grieve thou not over anything. Put thy trust in God, then stand firm in His love. He will, in truth, protect thee and aid whomsoever He willeth in this world and the next. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Take heed, then, of what hath befallen you and know that every soul shall perish and what remaineth is only that which hath been revealed from the Truth for those who have believed in God after He came from heaven with manifest sovereignty. Were anyone to possess all the treasuries of the heavens and earth, and were We to remove the veil from his eyes, he would expend them all for the mention of but one of his Lord’s remembrances. By My life! This is a truth well-known. Know thou, moreover, that Our name al-Javad is with Us, and God hath honored his face by turning it away from aught else but Him.

<p>Glorified be He Who has manifested His Cause with a sovereignty that has encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Verily He speaks the truth and summons all to this Announcement at which the limbs of the idolaters have quaked. No thing can frustrate Him, no matter can prevent Him, the power of the world cannot weaken Him, and the hosts of kings and rulers cannot frighten Him. Say: O people of creation, judge fairly by God, the Creator of heaven - can any among you race with the horsemen of utterance in this arena? Nay, by His Own Self, the Mighty, the Bestower! Your powerlessness is attested by a clear Book from His presence. This is a Day wherein the Mother Book calls out from this supreme horizon and summons all unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who has ears to hear and has turned towards Him, and woe unto the heedless ones. Judge fairly, O people, concerning that which has appeared in truth, and be not of the wrongdoers. When thou dost find the breezes of revelation and drink the choice wine of utterance from the cup of thy Lord’s bounty, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having drawn me nigh unto Thee and enabled me to turn toward Thy horizon and for having made manifest to me Thy path. I testify that Thou hast appeared and revealed what was hidden in the treasuries of God’s protection and what was stored in the blessed, luminous land - the place wherefrom the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary proclaims: The kingdom belongs to God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Thus has the dove of knowledge warbled upon one of the branches, and the herald has called out between earth and heaven: The gate of utterance has been opened and the All-Merciful has come with clear sovereignty. O people! I desire from you no benefit nor anything of things, but rather We desire to draw you nigh unto your Ancient Master, through Whose finger’s motion were set in motion worlds which none knoweth save God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is he who has judged fairly and turned towards Him, and blessed is every hearer who has heard the Call when it was raised from this noble station. Thus have We adorned the horizons of the heaven of the Tablet with the stars of utterance. Blessed are they who possess true knowledge.</p>

<p>O Ali-Akbar, upon thee be the Glory of God! He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon. Glorified is He Who hath sent down the verses and revealed that whereby the hearts of all created things have been attracted. He hath spoken and caused to speak whomsoever He desired to command by His authority. Verily, He hath power over all things. O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the call that hath been raised from the prison of Akka, calling all to a station that hath been mentioned in the name of God. Cast away what the people possess and take what ye have been given by God. Thus hath the command been sent down in a Tablet that was inscribed by the Pen of God. Blessed is he who hath cast aside whatsoever is in the world, clinging to that which hath appeared from the Ancient King. He hath been recorded among the people of Baha by the Pen of Glory with glory. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when every ignorant one known for knowledge turned away from it. Give thanks unto God for having made mention of thee before the Wronged One while He was in a place concealed from the eyes of the idolaters. He hath come with the truth and called all unto a horizon illumined with the lights of His countenance. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have taken for themselves a path unto God. O thou who hast turned! When thou dost inhale the fragrance of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Merciful, and art attracted by the breezes of proof, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having strengthened me, caused me to know Thee, made me to hear, and guided me unto Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement. I beseech Thee by the fruits of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and by its branches and leaves and rustling, to make me in all conditions detached from all else but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty, holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy, steadfast in the service of Thy Cause, and drinking the choice wine of Thy love. Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, and no affair hindereth Thee. Thou doest through Thy power whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O my Lord! Forgive me through Thy grace and generosity, then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who hath encompassed the worlds! Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses and made them clear evidences for those on earth, that they might recognize the Truth when it appeared among creation and be numbered among the triumphant. He hath sent the Messengers and revealed the Books, testifying that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise. Every Prophet hath given glad tidings of this Great Name, and He Who revealed the Bayan took the covenant of My Self - to this testifieth what We sent down upon Him from the heaven of My loving-kindness that hath preceded all worlds. When the appointed time came and He Who revealeth the verses appeared, every stubborn oppressor turned away from Him. Among them was he who, despite his nearness, arose in opposition and said “He hath appeared too soon.” Say: By My Beauty, He hath manifested Me as He pleased - verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. It behooveth every soul to thank God for this and to be of those who rejoice. Say: O people, look at what ye possess and what hath been revealed in truth in this wondrous Manifestation. Reflect on what appeared in ages past and what hath appeared on this luminous Day. Say: O people of the Bayan! If ye follow your vain imaginings, what is the difference between you and the people of the Furqan? Be fair in truth and be not of the wrongdoers. They await what they were promised of old, after He hath appeared by His mighty, sublime command. Say: This is the Cause whose greatness the Bayan hath testified to, were ye of those who know. Beware lest ye measure it by what ye possess. God hath made it sanctified above all likeness and comparison - verily He is the All-Knowing, the Wise. The Point of the Bayan hath lamented what hath befallen Me from you, O heedless ones! O thou who hast turned to God, hearken unto the call of this Wronged One from this far-off place, then aid Him through remembrance and praise, that perchance those who were veiled in those days might awaken - days the like of which the eyes of the near ones have never witnessed. May the Glory rest upon thee and upon those who have attained and have said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Quickener of the worlds!”</p>

Thus do We command thee in truth, verily We are the Commander. Drink thou from the Kawthar of justice from the fingers of grace, then find rest within thyself - verily We are imprisoned. And if thou desirest to know what hath befallen Me, look at the clouds when they rain upon you - thus mayest thou know Mine eyes if thou art of them that know. And if thou desirest to know My heart, look at the flame of fire. By God, it blazeth with what hath befallen it from the hosts of devils. And if thou desirest to know My liver - by God, no spot remaineth therein but hath been pierced by the spears of the idolaters and arrows of the hateful ones. Thus hath befallen the One Whom God created and nurtured through all months and years.</p>
<p>O servant! Leave behind all remembrance, then remember thy Lord at all times and be not of the patient ones. Then thank Him for having made Himself known to thee and sent down verses unto thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of them that rejoice. And glory be upon thee and upon whoso hath relied upon God in these days and been of them that trust.</p>

<p>O Jalal, who hast come into My presence and attained! He is manifest before the faces of the world. Glory be to God! Oppression and hatred have reached such a state that description and interpretation fall short of mentioning it. Forbearance hath become the cause of severity, and kindness hath led to wrath. They deny every righteous deed and make every easy thing difficult. How long, O my God, wilt Thou leave Thy wronged servants in the hands of the oppressors among Thy servants and the transgressors among Thy creatures? I beseech Thee, O Ocean of Generosity, by Thy Most Great Name, to make known to those who hate the fruits of their deeds and actions. Then enable them to turn back unto Thee.

On this day, which is the first day of the blessed Ramadan, the Wronged One is fasting.

<p>Glory be to Thee, O Thou Who hast, through the movement of Thy most august pen, subdued the concourse of Thy creation, and manifested the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom through the words which Thy tongue hath spoken before all who are in heaven and on earth. I testify that Thy might hath encompassed the whole universe, and Thy mercy surpassed all created things. The powers of the earth have never prevailed against Thee, nor hath the tumult of the nations frustrated Thy purpose. Thou hast revealed in Thy realm whatsoever Thou hadst desired through the power of Thy sovereignty, and hast ordained all things according to the good pleasure of Thy will. From eternity Thou hast inhabited the loftiest heights of Thy dominion and of Thine unfettered sovereignty, and wilt unto eternity continue to abide in the inaccessible retreats of Thy majesty and glory.</p>
<p>I implore Thee, by Thy Name through which the fragrance of the raiment of Thy presence was wafted, and the gentle winds of Thy bountiful grace passed over all created things, to graciously assist me, at all times and under all conditions, to serve Thy Cause, and to enable me to remember Thee and to extol Thy virtues. Let, then, Thine almighty arms enfold me, O my God, and ordain for me what beseemeth Thy bounty in every world of Thy worlds.</p>
<p>Thou beholdest, O my Lord, how I have set myself towards the ocean of Thy grace and the adored sanctuary of Thy favors. Deny me not, I pray Thee, the drops which are sprinkled from the ocean of Thy gifts; neither do Thou withhold from me the outpourings of the clouds of Thy tender mercies. I am he, O my God, that hath clung to the resplendent hem of Thy robe, and taken hold on Thy strong cord that none can sever. I testify that Thou hast created me, and nourished me, and brought me up, and fed me, and sustained me, that I may recognize Him Who is the Day-Spring of Thy signs, and the Revealer of Thy clear tokens. I offer unto Thee, therefore, most high praise, O Lord my God, that Thou hast suffered me to attain unto this most sublime station and this most august seat. Thou, truly, art the Great Giver, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Illumine mine eyes, O my Lord, with the splendors of the horizon of Thy Revelation, and brighten my heart with the effulgence of the Day-Star of Thy knowledge and wisdom, that I may set myself wholly towards Thy face, and be rid of all attachment to any one except Thee, in such wise that the changes and chances of the world will be powerless to hinder me from recognizing Him Who is the Manifestation of Thine own Self, and the Revealer of Thy signs, and the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation, and the Repository of Thy Cause.</p>

Exalted is the All-Merciful, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. O promoter of My Cause! Reflect upon the intelligence and insight of some of the ignorant ones who have appeared in the guise of knowledge.

This Cause is founded upon a firm, steadfast and immovable foundation that neither the winds of rejection and opposition, nor the hosts of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of all worlds, can shake. This is that blessed Word which, like unto the sun, hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine Tablet. Blessed are they that perceive. O friend! Counsel My loved ones and My chosen ones to observe the wisdom with which I have adorned the brocade of My Book of Laws and Ordinances. Thus doth He Who possesseth the Preserved Tablet of God command thee. The servant who standeth before the Throne hath presented thy letter and read that which thy pen, thy tongue and thy heart have set in motion in remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have heard it, accepted it, and answered thee with this wondrous Book. And when days had passed, thy other letter arrived which testified before the world to thy sincerity, thy turning to God and thy devotion to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. From each word of thy words was wafted the fragrance of My love, to which My pen and My tongue bear witness. By My life! This manifest and pure bounty which hath shone forth from this luminous horizon sufficeth thee. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God, the Goal of them that have recognized Him. The Servant desired to write to thee what he desired.

Hearken unto that which the Manifestation of My Cause hath spoken and that which the servants have uttered, that thou mayest be of them that are endued with knowledge. He saith - and His word is the sweetest - “I have taken a gem in His remembrance: He cannot be indicated by any indication, nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan from one who speaketh with knowledge.” After the dawning of that Word from the horizon of Will, doth it befit anyone to hesitate regarding this luminous, resplendent Revelation? Should anyone turn towards My most exalted horizon, would God torment him after what His tongue hath uttered in His mighty Book and what We have mentioned for thee in this clear Script? Doth it beseem anyone to cling to the Bayan in his turning away from God, or to use it as proof when the All-Merciful hath come with His mighty kingdom? Verily, concerning Him Who cannot be indicated by any indication from Him Who revealed the Bayan nor by His Book, they say what those who denied God and His Messengers said not in former times.

Whoso hath found the fragrance of My verses and the sweet savors of My robe hath soared in My atmosphere, hath sought My kingdom, hath lamented in his separation from Me, and hath shed tears over what hath befallen the Prisoner at the hands of them that have denied God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.

The trees proclaimed: “Behold the evidences of God’s Mercy”, and the twin streams recited in the eloquent tongue the sacred verse “From us all things were made alive”. Glorified be God! Mysteries were voiced by them, which provoked wonderment. Methought: in which school were they educated, and from whose presence had they acquired their learning? Yea! This Wronged One knoweth and He saith: “From God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsistent”.</p>
<p>Upon Our being seated, Ra?iyih, upon her be My glory, attained Our presence on thy behalf, laid the table of God’s bounty and in thy name extended hospitality to all present. In truth, all that which stimulateth the appetite and pleaseth the eye was offered, and indeed that which delighteth the ear could also be heard as the leaves were stirred by the Will of God, and from this movement a refreshing voice was raised, as if uttering a blissful call inviting the absent to this Feast. God’s power and the perfection of His handiwork could enjoyably be seen in the blossoms, the fruits, the trees, the leaves and the streams. Praised be God Who hath thus confirmed thee and her.</p>
<p>In brief, all in the Garden were recipients of the choicest bounties and in the end expressed their thanksgiving unto their Lord. O that all God’s beloved had been present on this day!</p>
<p>We beseech God, exalted be He, to cause to descend upon thee at every moment, a blessing and a mercy and a measure of divine grace from His presence. He is the Forgiving, the All-Glorious.</p>

<p>In these days it is natural that selfish passions should have prevented some from observing justice and equity, and whatsoever hath been sent down in the Tablets concerning unity and harmony. Even so, what is the Pen of the Most High to say, and to whose behoof should the Tongue of Knowledge speak? The ignorance of God’s creatures hath darkened the resplendent horizon of knowledge; the heedlessness of the people hath veiled the radiant dawn of guidance. In most of the Divinely-revealed Tablets We have enjoined upon all wisdom, unity, laudable deeds and a praiseworthy character. Though all have read these, and become aware of the Divine precepts, yet have they remained far distant from the Straight Path, and given precedence rather to their own desires. We have enjoined upon them unity; rather have they risen up in strife. We have summoned them unto wisdom; rather have they shown forth the reverse. In most of the Tablets they have been forbidden to direct themselves towards the Divine Court; this notwithstanding, each day a host arriveth and another host departeth. There is no power nor strength except in God! Ye have heard of the developments in the Land of Ta’, and the determination of some to commit a heinous act. We have commanded all souls to set the world in order; rather have they occupied themselves with sowing strife. Methinks they have regarded the Divine commands as of no account, and considered the Lordly precepts as mere fancies. They speak as passion moveth them, then attribute what they say unto the One True God. He, verily, is clear of those who have wrought mischief in the land after it had been set in order, and who speak that which hath been forbidden them in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Please God, in training certain weak souls, and in promoting concord and union, thou must, so far as thou art able, exert an unremitting effort, that haply they may attain unto that which God hath purposed. The sorrow of this Wronged One is clear and manifest from this Tablet. Verily, we are God’s, and unto Him shall we return. 251, Sad, Ha’ Sin Nun</p>

Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Rejoice in what God hath ordained for thee in all His worlds. By the life of God! This is better than all that hath been created in the heavens and earth, yet most men understand not. Thou wert mentioned before the Throne, as attested by that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen and by that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in its glorious station. Let not earthly affairs grieve thee. Rejoice in My remembrance of thee and My turning towards thee from this forbidden spot. Remember thy Lord, the Wronged One, Who throughout His days was in the hands of such as were heedless of the Witness and the Witnessed. Thus have We remembered thee while being outside the prison, through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>The Glory rest upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have turned with their hearts to the Most Sublime Horizon and remained steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the croaking of every rejected liar hath failed to deter them. O My leaf! Convey My glorification to the faces of My handmaidens who have attained unto this promised Day and have witnessed that which We witnessed aforetime. Dominion on that Day belongeth unto God, the Possessor of the Unseen and the Seen.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Beloved! Thou dost witness and see how the dogs of Thy creatures and the swine of Thy creation have gathered against us, though we commanded them only to approach the shore of the ocean of Thy oneness and to enter the gate of the city of Thy knowledge and bounty. Whenever we gave them glad tidings, O my God, of the wafting of the breezes of Thine eternal glory, they denied us because of what Satan cast into their hearts, and turned away from Thy Self. And whenever we strengthened them with the gems of Thy love, they rose up to wage war against us before Thee. How long will the hands of power not emerge from the sleeve of Thy sovereignty? And how long will Thy might and dominion not be manifested upon them, though they have rebelled against Thee to such extent that they have driven the best of Thy creation from Thy lands? By Thy glory, O my Lord, I do not complain of what has befallen me in Thy path, for I yearn for all tribulations in Thy love. But O my Beloved and my Purpose, when I hear from them what the Jews said concerning Thee, then my innermost being is shaken and my heart trembles, for they say “God’s hand is chained” - this from their rebellion against Thee and Thy trustees, though Thy hands of power were ever outstretched over all contingent things and extended over all created things. And they have reached such heights in their false statements that they have become hopeless of the sweet fragrances of Thy holy bounty and deprived of the gems of Thy grace and mercy. If it were said to them that the breezes of generosity and grace have wafted from the Ridvan of immortality, or that the Countenance of the Cause has appeared from the Most Exalted Kingdom, they would deny it and cry out, saying that God has ended succession with the family of Muhammad and none can be raised up besides them, as though they had knowledge of what lies within Thy knowledge. Glory be unto Thee, glory be unto Thee, O my God, above their rebellion against Thee and above the wonders of Thy patience regarding them. Therefore, O my God, cut them off from all that keeps them occupied with aught else but Thee, that they might return unto Thee and become detached from all save Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Bestower, the Generous.</p>

<p>The Most Holy, the Most Exalted! The appointed time hath come, and the Manifestation of your Lord, the Possessor of Creation, hath appeared. Every atom proclaimeth: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing!” By God! This is not the day of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Your All-Knowing Lord hath come in the shadows of the clouds, and the tongue of Revelation hath spoken: “Sovereignty belongeth to God, the Lord of all mankind.” Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance, and blessed are they who have believed in that land. God shall soon exalt you in truth and record your names in the Mother Book. It behooveth every soul in this day, upon hearing the Call, to say: “Here am I! Here am I! O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens!” I bear witness that Thou hast borne tribulations to manifest the Cause of Thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, and hast endured in the path of God what no other servant hath endured. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the lights of the Countenance and hath spoken in praise of his Lord, the Cleaver of the dawn. O servant! Give thanks unto thy Lord, for the Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee, despite being surrounded by the hosts of the wicked who, when We showed them the proof, said “This is a lying sorcerer,” and when We sent down unto them the verses, said “These are but fabrications.” Thus spoke those who came before. Blessed is he who hath cast them behind his back, and woe unto every doubting denier. Make mention of those who have believed in that land. Say: Blessed are ye for having turned unto the Qiblih of all horizons and recognized the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, Who hath come from the heaven of grandeur with power and sovereignty. Be ye steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the cawing of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all religions, shall not deter you. Those who have turned away from the Countenance, these wander in the wilderness of error. God shall soon seize them with His wrath, and aid those who, upon hearing their Lord’s call, said “Yea, O Thou Beloved of all creation!” The glory be upon you, O loved ones of God. We beseech God to assist you and strengthen you in His love and good-pleasure. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling, the Most High, the All-Chosen.</p>

Blessed art thou for having turned to the Countenance and turned away from those who act unjustly. Leave the world behind thee and remind the people in the days of thy Lord, that perchance the breaths of revelation may attract them and make them turn toward the Goal. Thus have We commanded thee and inspired thee - act according to what thou art commanded. He will verily reward thee in truth - there is no God but He, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>The Herald of God hath proclaimed from the right hand of the Throne: They that have on this day attained unto that which the Beloved hath desired - these are they who have truly prospered. And they that have turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon and have detached themselves from all else but Him - these are they who are sincere.</p>
<p>God willing, may you be ever joyous and prosperous through divine bestowals. It behooveth one such as you to exert the utmost effort to foster love and unity among the loved ones of God, and by the lamp of wisdom and utterance to guide all who dwell on earth to the straight path and manifest horizon. The sweet waters of life are present and visible, yet the people, heedless, turn to and occupy themselves with putrid waters. Vain imaginings have so deceived them that they have doubted the appearance of God and His presence, after He hath appeared in truth from this luminous station. Behold their paucity of understanding: they invoke the Names morning and evening, yet deny Him Who created them. These are indeed among the lowly ones. Blessed is he who hath cast away what he possessed and hath made his desire that which God, the Lord of the worlds, hath desired. Remind the people of this Most Great Name, that they may become aware and turn unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We have remembered thee over successive years and have sent thee the fragrance of the garment from this luminous Scene.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the new life - such matters have ever been beloved before the Throne. He verily blesseth you in whatsoever ye have desired for His good-pleasure. He is the Protector of whosoever hath loved Him. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Grieve not over anything. Rejoice with the most great joy and place thy trust in the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Turn ye both unto the Most Great Scene, the Spot of God, the Powerful, the Transcendent, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Thus have We given you both leave, as a mercy from Our presence.

Be thou ready to hearken unto My most sweet call in this most exalted station which God hath adorned with His mighty throne. O Land of Prison! Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath made thee the dawning-place of the angels and the Spirit, and the dayspring of His signs and the rising-place of His clear proofs.

Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. My God, my God! Thou seest how the thirsty one hath hastened to the Euphrates of Thy mercy, and the poor one to the ocean of Thy bounty, and the abased one to the heaven of Thy glory. I beseech Thee by the Point through which the books of the world were distinguished, and by Thy Name whereby Thou didst illumine the faces of the nations, to bring forth for me from the hand of Thy power the pearls of the depths of Thy knowledge. Thou seest me, O my God, standing before Thee to serve Thy loved ones, speaking Thy praise, and holding fast to Thy firm cord and to Thy Most Great Name.

We heard it with an ear that has no likeness in the world and saw it with an eye that brings comfort to all eyes. That which you hoped for from the bounty and favor of the Desired One of the world - God willing, you will attain it and have attained it. O Mahdi! Consider the unburdened heart as an ocean, and the heart that is clouded by the dust of the world as the eye of a needle. Praise be to God that in your early days you attained the recognition of Truth and attained His presence, and drank the Kawthar of inner meanings in Iraq and in the Land of Mystery and the Most Great Prison, and freely partook of this greatest feast.

God willing, We shall summon him later. Thus has My Most Exalted Pen spoken - inform him that he may be among those who are informed. O Mahdi! We love those who desire Our presence and We love to see them - to this bear witness I and you and he who stands before the Face and writes, and this swift Pen. We have enjoined wisdom upon all and We must observe it. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over what He willeth. Praise be to God, the One, the Single, the Unique, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

Thus doth the Pen of the Command enjoin thee from the presence of the Mighty, the Trustworthy. Be not dismayed when the clamor of men ariseth. He will, verily, protect thee through the truth.

Say: This is a land wherein We raised up the Prophets and sent them unto all who dwell on earth. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He desireth for whom He pleaseth. O people of the earth! Despair not of the Spirit of God and His mercy. Turn ye unto the Dayspring of Revelation with spirit and fragrance. Abandon vain fancy and hold fast to My Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted throughout all worlds. Be ye My trusted ones in My lands, and the lamps of guidance among My creatures, and the horizons of justice in My kingdom. Thus hath the command flowed from the Pen moved by the finger of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Those whose eyes are drunken - these shall find no helper. But those who have drawn nigh - these are possessed of true vision. Subdue hearts through the name of the Beloved, then help your Lord through this Name by which the Tablets have been adorned. Those who turned away and opposed - these are the companions of error. All things bear witness to God’s testimony, yet most people are in doubt and schism. Thus have We caused to flow forth unto thee from the Most Exalted Pen the Kawthar of remembrance and praise in remembrance of the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven. When thou hast attained, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of Verses!</p>

<p>The Most Exalted Pen proclaims: The whole world hath been created for the knowledge of Him Who is the Ancient King, and brought from nothingness into being. Yet when the Dayspring of God’s Day appeared and the horizon of His Manifestation was illumined, all became entangled in their selfish desires and remained veiled from, nay turned away from, the Lord of Names - save for a few souls who, through divine confirmation and heavenly grace, became free from idle fancies and vain imaginings, and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they! Soon shall the station of these souls become evident and manifest to all the world.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thy letter was presented at the Divine Throne and attained the presence of the Wronged One of the horizons. All the souls mentioned therein have been blessed with the remembrance of God. God hath forgiven them as a token of His grace and ordained for them that which gladdeneth hearts and minds. God willing, may they be occupied at all times with the remembrance of the All-Merciful, detached and free from all else. Today all must hold fast to the divine commandments revealed in the Most Holy Book and walk among the people with perfect wisdom. This is God’s command. Blessed art thou and those who act accordingly. Any word spoken without wisdom is not and will not be acceptable at the Divine Throne. Know ye, O My loved ones, that which hath been revealed in this Tablet and hold fast unto it, by the leave of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. One must be engaged in the remembrance of Truth with utmost joy, for His grace hath been and will be, God willing, with you. Previously a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to thee from the heaven of the Divine Will. Verily, He loveth him who loveth Him and remembereth him who remembereth Him. He is, in truth, the Protector of the patient ones, of those who remember Him, and of the sincere ones. The glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon all who have turned to the Intended One and upon every maidservant who hath turned to God, the One, the Peerless, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>The Supreme Pen declares: In the moment of utterance We are silent, and in the moment of silence We speak. How strange is the world that has appeared, while the servants remain heedless of it! All things give glad tidings and proclaim that which causes bodies to soar, let alone spirits. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The Sun of Truth has risen, the ocean of utterance is surging, and He Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation. At one time He turns to the right and says: “O people of Baha! This day is your day, which has come for your joy, your gladness and your delight. By God the Truth! That which was recorded in the Books of God and stored up in His knowledge has been manifested. Arise to help your Lord through wisdom and utterance.” And at another time He turns to the left and says: “O company of the heedless! Be fair in this manifest Cause. Beware lest the books of the world hold you back from the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity. He has come with clear proof and evidence, by which the hearts of those near unto God and the sincere ones have been attracted. Say: O people! The signs of God have come to you and the fragrance of utterance has been wafted throughout all contingent being. Cast aside that which keeps you from drawing nigh unto God, your Purpose, and take hold of that which you have been commanded in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. He will assist you with the truth and ordain for you that which will bring joy to your eyes, expand your breasts and gladden your hearts. He is, verily, the Most Merciful of the merciful. Give thanks to thy Lord, for He has remembered thee when He was wronged at the hands of the oppressors, that thou mayest arise to serve His Cause and be among the triumphant. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God, the Lord of all worlds, and whom the tyranny of the Pharaohs did not prevent - they turned to Him and said: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in the heavens and on earth.’”</p>

<p>The Most Holy, Most Glorious Book hath appeared from the horizon of the Command and was witnessed in its manifestation. Whoso readeth a single letter thereof turneth toward the sanctuary and detacheth himself from all created things, and God, the All-Merciful, is My witness in what I say. Blessed is he who is illumined by this Light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Manifestation. He is among the manifestations of beauty and hath been mentioned with justice in the Tablet of Glory. The earth hath been illumined by the light of thy Lord, and the darkness hath been dispelled by the dawning light which was visible from the horizon of the Prison. Say: None can test God in this Revelation; rather God testeth whom He willeth. Thus was it sent down in the Bayan from the presence of the All-Merciful Who encompasseth all things. Choose ye what God hath chosen for you. Beware lest ye make your faith dependent upon your idle fancies. Thus hath the decree been ordained. Say: Doth not what hath appeared in this Revelation suffice you? By God! Power hath been manifested, sovereignty hath encompassed all, and the signs have filled the horizons. None denieth them save he who is deprived of truth. Were We to will it, We would make all who are on earth one community. Verily He hath power over all things. Among the people is he who desireth from God that which beseemeth him not, and when he seeth it he turneth away and returneth unto his own people, retreating. Those who have turned toward it have not acted according to what was ordained in the Bayan for this Revelation - how much less those who have turned away by following vain imaginings. Thy Lord is indeed cognizant of what I say. Say: Have ye ever heard before of what hath graciously appeared in this Revelation? Nay, by the Lord of Justice! Ponder, O people, that ye may find a way to the truth. Grieve thou not over anything. We have ordained for thee an exalted station. Glorify thy Lord with praise. He is with whomsoever desireth Him. Blessed is he who chooseth Him as his friend. The glory be upon thee and upon whomsoever hath turned toward God with a countenance illumined by the lights of the Throne.</p>

Should anyone today drink the choice wine of life from the chalice of recognition, it would so transport him that he would cry out among the servants with this Remembrance which God hath made the Dawning-Place of lights. Blessed art thou for having turned away from those who follow idle fancies and turned unto the Dayspring of certitude. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before the Throne and for having attained that whereby thy remembrance shall endure in the Book of thy Lord, the Lord of Return. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou seest me turning toward the horizon of Thy grace and the ocean of Thy bounty, acknowledging Thy singleness and assured of Thy oneness. I beseech Thee by Him Who is the Possessor of all names and the Creator of earth and heaven to assist me to serve Thee amongst Thy creatures and to sanctify me from all that beseemeth not Thy days.

Be fair in what has appeared in truth and be not of those who denied God’s proof and His evidence and committed that which caused the dwellers of Paradise and those who circle round the Throne to lament, both morn and eve.

I beseech Thee by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the lights of Thy Throne, O Lord of all beings, to make me one of those who have sacrificed their souls and all they possessed in Thy path.

Rejoice thou in that which the All-Merciful hath testified, for nothing in the heavens or earth can equal it.” You must arise today to aid the Cause and forbid people from matters that are displeasing and deeds that are unseemly, that all may drink from the cup of sanctification and holiness. If they fix their gaze upon that which hath been and continues to be revealed from the Source of the Cause, this alone shall be and hath been the cause of the guidance of the people. Ask thou God that He may enable all to do what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Whosoever desires to teach the Cause of God must conduct himself with the utmost kindliness and forbearance, for the people are weak, and thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bountiful, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Thy letter was delivered by Ismi Mahdi to the Most Great Scene. We read it and heard what thou didst call unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist thee night and day to spread His Cause and to teach what hath been revealed from Him with the wisdom We have sent down in most of the Tablets. Previously the Manifest Tablet was sent specifically for thee by the hand of a trusted one. Ponder thou on what hath been revealed in truth, then read it with the melody of the heart - verily it attracts the servants to the straight path.</p>
<p>Exert the utmost effort and striving in sanctifying and purifying the servants, that strangers may inhale the fragrances of the All-Merciful from the chosen ones and turn toward the intended goal. We shall aid thee in manifesting the Cause of thy Lord. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. May the glory rest upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning the Cause of thy Lord, and upon thy household who have attained this manifest grace. Convey My greetings to My loved ones, then mention them with this wise remembrance.</p>

<p>Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen and been illumined by the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful. By the mystery of existence! Today whosoever hath attained unto the divine Word, he possesseth true wealth and genuine riches. The arena of the world hath not been, nor is it now, capable of manifesting the bounties of God except in limited measure. However, the hand of power shall reveal that which is now concealed. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Most Great Ocean and drunk therefrom by the leave of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Repeatedly hath been revealed for thee that whose fragrance hath encompassed the world. In these days Asad, upon him be My glory, mentioned thee in Our presence. Again hath this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet been revealed and sent, that thou mayest inhale from it the fragrance of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and be of them that render thanks.</p>
<p>Beware lest the happenings of the world sadden thee, or the doubts of them that have denied God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: My God, my God! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I heard Thy most sweet call and turned unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens and Lord of the Kingdom of Names. I beheld the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and turned toward them through Thy grace and bounty. Were it not for Thy grace, who would bring me nigh unto Thee, and were it not for Thy bounty, who would guide me to the Dayspring of Thy signs and the Dawning-Place of Thy mysteries? I am he who, O my God, hath clung to Thee and committed all affairs unto Thee and placed his trust in Thee. Do with me, through Thy generosity and bounty, whatsoever Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily Thou knowest better than I, and Thou knowest what harmeth me and profiteth me. I testify that Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Informed, and that Thou art the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. O Lord! I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hand of Thy bounty, whom nothing whatsoever, no matter or decree, hath deterred from turning unto Thee and clinging to the hem of Thy mercy. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Loving.</p>

<p>Your numerous letters were considered in the Most Great Prison and your complaints were heard. However, God is witness and testament that this Wronged One has desired the good of all the world, and in all Tablets has mentioned that which leads to the upliftment of souls and the exaltation of being. Some have followed the commandments, while others have remained occupied with their own desires and deprived and veiled from that which was ordained by God. If thou wouldst reflect a little and observe with a pure eye, thou wouldst attain certitude of the grace, generosity, bounty, kindness and mercy of God - a certitude which no doubt can seize nor uncertainty erase. Thou must exert utmost effort and striving to preserve that which hath been revealed unto thee, that it may endure for thee. Be not grieved by the afflictions that have befallen thee, for greater ones have been visited upon this Most Great Wronged One. I swear by the Beloved of the worlds that every abasement suffered in the path of God is pure glory, and every hardship that appeareth will become the essence of ease. Be not saddened by any matter. With complete sincerity, be engaged in the remembrance of the Intended One in the nights and days, and be detached and severed from all else. Concerning Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, thou hadst written: None should speak of him except in goodly terms, and that which hath appeared from him is in the hand of God, his Lord and the Lord of the worlds. Should He wish, He will accept him, and should He wish, He will reject him. He shall not be questioned about what He doeth. There is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty. The favor of God, both before and after, hath been with him. He, verily, giveth good reward unto them who follow the Command of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Glory be upon him and upon thee and upon those who have clung to the hem of God’s pure and luminous garment.</p>

<p>O friends of God, upon them be the Glory of God! He is the Wise Counselor! The Wronged One proclaims: O people of God! Know ye the worth and station of this glorious and mighty Day, and arise to redeem that which hath slipped from your grasp. The Day is the Day of deeds, not words. We cherish the hope that ye will aid the Cause of God through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, through goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. O Joseph! The Wronged One hath remembered and continueth to remember His loved ones from the prison-chamber. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having sent down unto Thy loved ones Thy verses and manifested unto them Thy clear tokens and illumined their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O Ocean of Bounty, by Thy Most Great Signs, to enable me and Thy loved ones to stand firm with supreme steadfastness, and ordain for me and for them that which befitteth the heaven of Thy grace and the sun of Thy mercy. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Abu’l-Qasim and remind him of the verses of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O people of God! This day unity and concord are the helpers of the Cause. Blessed is the soul that is occupied with bringing hearts together for the sake of God. God willing, may all be enabled to achieve this mighty deed. At this moment We make mention of him who hath been named Mirza Baba, that he may hear the call from the Supreme Horizon and be numbered among the successful ones. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and the might that emanateth from His presence. Beware lest the cawing of the ravens or the oppression of the aggressors deter thee from God, the Lord of all worlds. We make mention of Our loved ones in that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of My handmaidens who have believed in the All-Informed Single One. We seal this epistle with mention of him who hath turned toward My horizon and soared in the atmosphere of My love, who hath been named Shafi’ in My Mighty Book. The Glory from Us be upon My loved ones and My handmaidens, and upon him who hath been named Ahmad-i-’Ali, from God, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Hidayat, upon whom be the loving-kindness of God! He is the All-Guiding, the All-Informed. The purpose of God - exalted be His glory - in creating, at the primal stage, hath been and continueth to be the knowledge of Him. And since the door of knowledge of the Hidden Essence, the Concealed Mystery, is closed, He hath sent forth from the realm of the unseen to the plane of existence holy souls who are the Manifestations of His Cause, the Daysprings of His decree, the Rising-places of His revelation and the Recipients of His knowledge. And He hath made recognition of them, obedience and disobedience to them, turning toward or away from them, and belief and unbelief in them, to be the standard. Whosoever turned toward them was accounted among those who drew nigh, and was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God’s Book as one of the believers. However, at the time of the appearance of these Manifestations of the Cause, most of the people of the world were found to be heedless, veiled, turning away and denying. The cause and reason for these thick veils have been the divines of the age, as every person of insight and understanding hath testified and continues to testify to this fact. We beseech God to rend asunder, with the finger of His power, the veils of the world and not to deprive His servants of the ocean of inner meanings. Mention of thee was made before this Wronged One in the Most Great Prison, therefore this Tablet hath been sent down purely for the sake of God, that perchance through its fragrance the seekers and wayfarers may find their path to the True City. This is the day of the most great bounty and the most mighty grace. Blessed is the one who hath arisen to serve and hath freed the helpless people from idle fancies and vain imaginings. God willing, through the efforts of His chosen ones and loved ones, thou shalt loose the fetters of those who are bound and teach them to soar, until time remaineth, undertake a deed whose fragrance of eternity will be diffused. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist thee and aid thee and give thee to drink of the Kawthar of immortality from the hand of bounty. Verily He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>Let His honor Aqa Muhammad-Rida take note. Your letter arrived and was read and presented, and this is what was issued from the Source of Utterance from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Bestowing:</p>
<p>O Rida! May you be the recipient, through the infinite favors of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, of divine grace. God is Our witness and fair-minded people bear testimony that whatever this Wronged One has spoken has been for the good of the friends of God. The one true God has commanded His servants to engage in consultation, that all may hold fast to His cord and act accordingly. You and all the friends must in all conditions fix your gaze upon God and place your trust in Him. The world has had and has no value. Be not grieved, for if one were to become the apparent owner of the whole earth, he would surely spend it all rather than see even one of the friends saddened, let alone anything beyond that. We enjoin upon you that which shall profit you in every world of the worlds of your Lord, the All-Numbering, the All-Knowing. The counsel that shone forth from the horizon of the will of the Lord of all beings was not given as an absolute command, but rather was offered purely out of wisdom and goodwill. Whatever appears beneficial after consultation may be acted upon.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote about Abdul-Rahim, he too has presented his requests. However, a true friend has always wished to see his loved ones united. Yet due to certain outward worldly matters, this quality is rarely observed. Therefore it is best that you travel together, and after arrival at the mentioned place, there is no objection if each person acts according to his own will in matters of outward affairs. These matters, if carried out in a spirit of joy and fragrance, are praiseworthy. The Glory be upon the people of Baha.</p>

<p>O Nabil-i-Qabil-i-Ba’ [upon him be 966 (Baha’u’llah)], thy call hath reached the ears of the Wronged One of the world in the Most Great Prison. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Qiblih of creation, and We behold thee steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve that which hath been bestowed upon thee. Today the station of steadfast souls is not known. By the life of God! It shall soon be made manifest through the truth from the presence of the Mighty, the Ancient. The servant present before the Countenance was present, and he presented the letter thou hadst sent to him, and he acted according to thy testament. This word dawned from the heaven of thy love: “O my God! I have cast away what is with me in hope of what is with Thee.” Praise be to God that thou wert assisted to utter this exalted word and send it to the Most Holy Court. We have repeated this word which thy tongue did speak. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. God willing, the fruit of this word shall appear for thee and thou shalt attain unto it. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed, and He is the Speaker, the All-Seeing. Say: Glory be unto Thee! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, detached from all else save Thee, and Thou hearest my lamentation and my cry, and Thou witnesseth what condition I am in through my love for Thee and for Thy chosen ones and Thy pure ones. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to open before my face the door of Thy glory and providence. All my limbs, members, organs and veins testify to Thy power and Thy sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Powerful. O my Lord! Aid me to perform a deed whereby Thy Cause may be exalted and whereby my remembrance may endure in Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion. O my Lord! I am the poor one who hath clung to Thy All-Bountiful Name. Write down for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in the hereafter and in this world. Verily Thou art the Possessor of the throne and the dust.

Say: O people, hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised up in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious - verily, there is none other God but I, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Be thou a herald of this Name amongst the servants, then draw hearts through this wondrous Remembrance. He verily aideth whom He willeth through a sovereignty from His presence.

Is there any doubt concerning His Manifestation? Open your eyes that ye may behold Him shining from the horizon of His Cause, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. Is there any uncertainty about His sovereignty after it hath encompassed all who are in the realm? Fear God and follow not the wrongdoers. Grieve not over anything. We hear thy call. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. Those who have disbelieved - God will soon seize them with a might from His presence and will exalt the names of those who have turned to the lights of the Countenance when it shone forth from this luminous horizon. Be as thy Lord hath been. The oppression of those who denied the All-Merciful did not prevent Him from utterance. He speaketh from the horizon of tribulation and calleth the people unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Be thou steadfast in such wise that nothing shall prevent thee from God. Thus hast thou been commanded by the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed art thou in that thou hast spoken of the Most Great Name and illumined thy heart with this wise Remembrance. By My life! There hath been ordained for thee that which none comprehendeth. Were We to reveal it in the realm, thou wouldst hear from all things saying: This is the bounty and mercy of God upon him who spoke His Name. He verily recompenseth the doers of good. Subdue hearts through this Most Great Name and faces through His mighty remembrance.

Did We not inform you of a Day when God would come upon clouds of light? Then shall no soul’s belief profit it. Even so was this matter inscribed by the Finger of grace upon the Tablets. But when He came with the truth, ye denied and disbelieved in Him, and were negligent concerning His Cause, and were far removed from the shores of justice. By God, the True One! On that Day no soul’s belief shall profit it except by entering beneath this shade which hath been, in truth, extended. As for thee, remain steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause. Beware lest thou associate aught with Him, for this would be a grievous sin. Recite each day that which hath been sent down from the heaven of Command, that He may preserve thee in truth and establish thee upon the straight path. Know thou that the verses are like unto the spirit, and through them doth God quicken those who have believed and turned unto Him. Thus hath the matter been decreed. They who have deprived themselves thereof are as the dead, not the living, and their names are not mentioned before the Throne. Say: The dead are they who have not been quickened today by the breezes of the All-Merciful and have not drunk the choice wine of verses from a wondrous cup. Thus doth God distinguish between the fortunate and the wretched, between light and darkness, through a word which hath been differentiated from the Mother of Verses.

<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In the name of the Ever-Abiding One! This is a Book from the Wronged One to him who hath believed in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, that the rapture of the Call may seize him and bring him to a station wherein he beholdeth naught in existence save the effulgences of His Worshipped Lord, and speaketh amongst the peoples that which the Most Great Name hath spoken: that there is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>We have recognized thy turning unto God and thy directing thyself toward His Face; wherefore have We sent down unto thee this Tablet. Thy Lord, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Blessed is the soul that hath turned in such wise as beseemeth turning unto the All-Possessing, the Most High, and blessed is the breast that hath been illumined by the lights that have shone forth from this manifest horizon.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Deprive not yourselves of God’s bounty in His days, and follow not every rejected idolator. No Book have We sent down but the people denied it, and no Messenger have We raised up but they opposed and turned away from him. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled aforetime, yet most of the people understand not. This is a Day wherein We have made the highest among the people their lowest, and their lowest their highest, and We have made those who were oppressed the inheritors of the Kingdom, even as We promised them aforetime. Thy Lord, verily, is potent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>Arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, then unlock the cities of hearts with the keys of His Name, the Guardian over the seen and unseen. Beware lest the conditions of creation hinder thee or the turning away of those who have denied the Promised One grieve thee. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before His Face, and for that which hath been sent down unto thee - that which the treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf, then give them the glad-tidings of this Remembrance whereby spirits have taken flight and minds have been attracted. The glory of God be upon thee and upon them from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down in truth unto those who have chosen a path unto God and followed the Truth when it came from the Dayspring of the Unseen with clear sovereignty. Say: By my Lord, the All-Loving! The Promised One hath appeared, and on His right hand are the hosts of divine revelation and inspiration, and on His left hand is the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the All-Praiseworthy. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great News, for which the Concourse on High and the Prophets and Messengers yearn to attain. Turn unto Him with your hearts, for He is the One with Whom God made His covenant before the creation of the heavens and earth. O people! Do ye disbelieve in God in Whom ye had believed? This is naught but manifest calumny. Cast not behind you that which God hath entrusted unto you; turn unto it with an illumined heart. Unite in the days of God - thereby will His Cause be spread amongst His servants and His sweet savors waft over all lands. Hearken unto that wherewith ye have been counseled by the Pen of Revelation from the presence of One mighty and beauteous. Differ not in the Cause of God, for thereby are gladdened the hearts of the idolaters. Gather ye together in spirit and fragrance, then recite the verses of the All-Merciful - through them shall the gates of true knowledge be opened unto your hearts. Then shall ye find yourselves possessed of steadfastness and behold your hearts in manifest joy. Grieve not at anything. Remember My tribulations and afflictions, then My imprisonment and trials. Thus do We impart unto thee that which shall tranquilize thy heart and cause thee to be of them that are firmly established. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having caused His Pen to move in the prison in remembrance of thee. By My life! This is naught but a supreme bounty. Seize thy chance in these days. Arise to aid thy Lord amidst all peoples. He, verily, aideth whomsoever He willeth and ordaineth for every soul that which beseemeth it. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down from the heaven of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower, that it may attract one of His loved ones in these days wherein the Lord of Lords hath come upon clouds of glory. Arise and say: O people! By God the Truth, He Who was promised hath come with wondrous sovereignty, and all who are in the heavens and on earth were struck with terror save those who approached God with humility and turned unto Him. Say: Beware lest ye pause upon the Path - pass ye beyond it and be not of them who halted and failed. Rend asunder the veils of glory by My power and sovereignty, then burn away the barriers. Say: This indeed is He Who hath come unto you once again with His Most Great Name, and upon His brow hath been inscribed by the Pen of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. This verily is the Beloved of the heavens and earth, through Whom the trumpet was sounded and the mountains were moved and the fruits fell from the trees and faces fell prostrate in the dust before God, in Whose grasp is the kingdom of verses and Who ruleth the beginning and the return. Say: O people! Deny not Him in Whom ye believed and from whom the Beauty of the All-Merciful took your covenant in the realm of the Bayan. Fear God, O ye who are endued with insight! Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, then convey unto the people this Revelation which hath caused flesh to creep and the feet of them that doubted the meeting with their Lord to slip, and hath brought joy to the eyes of the loved ones. Be not silent in thy Lord’s remembrance, and regard not those who disbelieve save as ashes scattered by the tempests of self and desire, carried wheresoever they list, finding no rest on the Day of Reckoning. In the Mother Book hath been ordained for thee a station from which the fragrances of sweet herbs are wafted. Gird up thy loins to assist the Cause of God and fear not them that have joined partners with God their Lord - they are naught but in perdition. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon them that have believed in God and have detached themselves from every doubting idolater.</p>

<p>This is a Book from the Primal Point unto him who hath believed in God and His signs, that he may call to mind within himself the Most Great Remembrance, Who was visible from the horizon of the Cause, and may detach himself from whatsoever beareth the name of a thing, and be drawn unto a praiseworthy station of holiness. O servant! Hearken unto that which God calleth thee from the direction of the Throne, then remind the people of that which thou art capable, for this is what the Tongue of Ancient Days commandeth thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from every rejected soul. Say: Verily the Primal Point, in His latter Manifestation, speaketh with the Most Glorious tongue, saying: “O people! Did We not give you glad tidings of My appearance after Me? Yet when He appeared with the truth and came unto you with all of God’s clear tokens, wherefore did ye disbelieve in Him and turn away from His beauty and wage war against His person? Therefore fear ye God and dispute not against His Self, and be ye steadfast upon the straight path of truth. By My life! Whoso turneth away from Him hath turned away from the beauty of God from all eternity, and whoso turneth unto Him hath ascended unto God and chosen for himself a beloved station beneath the canopy of his Lord’s protection.” O people! Fear ye God, then be ye ashamed before Me, and commit not unseemly deeds within your souls, and withhold not yourselves from the Law which hath truly flowed from the right hand of this Throne whereon the Ancient Beauty hath been established, from the presence of the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. And thou, O servant, strive within thyself lest the clamor of the idolaters affect thee. Rather, it behooveth thee to ascend unto a station wherein thy word will influence the hearts of every remote doubter. Purify thyself with the living waters from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily in the inner meaning of these words flow mysteries, if thou be of them that know. And glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward the shore of might nigh at hand.</p>

Verily it is a revelation sent down through grace from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And therein is set forth that point of sorrow whereby the hearts of the lovers were consumed, and by reason of which the leaves were severed from the trees and the faces of the mystics turned pale, and the breezes of the spirit were withheld from the paradise of eternity, and then the holy fragrances were cut off from the hearts of the Messengers, for therein is mentioned that which causeth the winds of separation to blow upon the temples of all beings. And therein hath the nightingale of separation warbled in the region of Iraq with such a melody that thereby were the pillars of the Word scattered and the realities of the Concourse on high were separated. Say: The Bird of Oneness hath flown from branch to another branch, and thereby are the spirits of the lovers brought to naught. Say: The Holy Nightingale hath winged its flight unto the paradise of transcendent glory. By God! The temples of the people of eternity have donned the garments of separation, inasmuch as the Dove of Constancy hath ascended from the region of Iraq, and this is a strange sorrow. Say: O people of the earth! Ye have been heedless of that which God hath graciously bestowed upon you, and thus have ye remained in manifest error. Say: Now hath the heavenly table been withdrawn from your midst, and this is an abasement unto all created things. Therefore take ye cognizance within yourselves and fear God, your Creator, then have mercy upon your souls and be not of the heedless ones. Arise to redress what ye have missed and make good wherein ye have been negligent, and turn unto God, the Mighty, the Generous. Then be patient and grieve not at the separation, and be content with what hath been ordained for you by the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. For He is more knowing of all things and ordaineth the measures of the Cause, and this is what hath been decreed in the preserved Tablets of might. Then gather ye together in the Cause and be as mountains in the Cause of God, such that your feet shall not slip upon the path even should all who are in the kingdoms of creation combine against you.</p>

<p>O Thou, the Creator of every wondrous creation</p>
<p>This is what hath been revealed from the heaven of eternity, and in it there is set forth the station wherein the Beauty of god hath mounted the Throne of a Great Name. He verily hath been promised in all the Scriptures under every name, if ye are those who know. In the Bayan he was named as He who shall be made manifest, and He shall appear in the Mustaghath with evident authority.</p>
<p>Say: By God! This is the day the like of which the eyes of the unseen have not witnessed; how much less the eyes of those who have shut themselves out as by a veil. Blessed is he who appeareth in utmost humility in this day in the presence of God, and readeth this Tablet before his Throne, so that the hearing of the Lord may listen to its melodies, which have been altered in the past betwixt heaven and earth. In this manner shall this Name be mentioned in a seat which god hath sanctified beyond the description of the people of the world. Our intention in whatever hath been revealed in this Tablet is none other but My own Self which is supreme over all creation.</p>
<p>Whosoever awaiteth a Manifestation after Me is indeed among the lost. And He who shall be manifest after the thousand years will speak in My Name. And He who shall come in the time of the Mustaghath will bear witness unto Me, and proclaim that I am God, the Lord of heaven and earth. No one hath wholly comprehended this Revelation, except to a prescribed measure. He verily knoweth all things. Hold fast after Me unto the Branches that have branched from this Ancient Root. From them will the fragrance of My garment be shed throughout the world, and none shall inhale it, save those who turn their faces towards Him, and remain steadfast.</p>
<p>It behooveth you, O people of Baha, to be firm in the Cause of god in all circumstances, and beware lest ye follow every ignorant transgressor. After the Aghsan, a lofty station hath been ordained for the servant in attendance before the Throne. It is seemly that ye should reve the Kith and Kin among whom was manifested the Beloved of the Worlds, and who believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Thus was it revealed in the Bayan, and in this luminous Tablet. Whosoever turneth away from them is of the disbelievers and who joined partners with God, and is among the truly lost, unless he expresseth repentance, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>

The Hour hath struck and God, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Choosing, hath come. Say: O people! Believe in Him through Whom the earth and heaven were illumined, and Who hath established Himself upon the Throne which no vision can perceive.

Know thou, moreover, that whatsoever the people flee from, We desire it in the path of God, as they who are endued with insight do testify. Would that this blood might be shed in His path!

I am content with what He hath been pleased to ordain for Me, and I thank Him for that wherewith I have been afflicted at the hands of these wicked ones. Say: O people! Deny not Him Who was promised you in the Bayan and Who calleth you unto God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling. Beware lest ye slay Him with the swords of your rejection. Fear God and be not of the companions of the Fire. Stand thou firm, then, in the love of God and shun them who have disbelieved and associated partners with God after their Lord, the All-Merciful, had come unto them and the Cause had been decided in truth. There is no God but Him. His is the command and the creation. All who are in the heavens and on earth glorify Him by night and by day. Take comfort in thy Lord, then withdraw thyself from the wicked ones who have openly denied God - they are but in perdition.

Hearken unto My call even as thou didst hear it time and again, as beareth witness to this the Lord of all creation while sorrows encompass Him in this mighty prison. We sent thee a Tablet before, and before that another Tablet - verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By My life! The Pen loveth him who is steadfast in the Cause of his Lord, and the Tongue desireth to speak that which draweth it to the ultimate Goal and the Divine Lote-Tree - He is the Attractor, the All-Wise. We were seated in the house when the servant who was present brought thy letter and read it before Us, and We answered thee with this perspicuous Tablet. Verily We answer thee at all times, as testifieth He with Whom is a preserving Book. O thou who gazest upon the Face! By God, the tale of the sacrifice hath returned - God hath manifested it through a clear command. By My life! The Most Great Sacrifice hath appeared. Woe unto the people who imagined they had gained, when by God they are in manifest loss. The Most Exalted Pen hath not rested in these days, and hath revealed that whereby the dwellers of Paradise, and the Concourse on High, and the inhabitants of the Cities of Names have lamented. The heart of Baha hath been so distressed that all things have been seized with perturbation, and were it not for My Name, the All-Composing, all would be numbered among the dead. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Pen of thy Lord. We send thee what We have revealed. Verily thy Lord mourneth and saith: “Praise be to God for what He hath ordained and decreed.” Verily He is the Beloved in His Cause, and the One to be obeyed in His judgment, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have remembered Him even as the Most Exalted Pen hath made mention in this mighty prison.</p>

<p>O Haji Aqa, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the nights and days, the people of Baha beseech God that He may not afflict His servants with vain imaginings like unto the vain imaginings of the Shi’ih sect. They considered themselves the most just of all people, yet they committed manifest injustice in their killings, such that the people of the cities of justice and fairness remain bewildered. We hope from God that the people of God will arise with utmost effort to protect His servants, lest another party appear like unto that party and again bring forth that which causeth the fire of hatred and animosity to be kindled. Thy name hath come before the Wronged One, Who maketh mention of thee in this perspicuous Book. Today is the day of teaching. Each one of the loved ones must turn to this Most Great Cause and with wisdom, utterance, spirit and fragrance guide the heedless to the horizon of awareness. Thus doth the Dove of Utterance warble upon the highest branch of possibility, by the command of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor ’Aziz, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In His Name, through Whom was broken the seal of the Choice Wine!</p>
<p>O ’Aziz! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from this spot wherefrom the Call hath been raised, as a token of grace from God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and the eye that hath seen, and woe unto the heedless! Say: He Who was hidden from eyes hath come, and He through Whom the fragrance of God, the Lord of this exalted station, was diffused, hath appeared. The Promised One hath come with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth. Should anyone ask thee about the Glory, say: Verily it is under the claws of hatred, as attesteth My perspicuous Book. The winds of oppression have encompassed the Lamp of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Say: My God, my God! Aid Thy servants to arise to serve Thee and assist them to be steadfast in Thy love. Verily Thou art the Powerful One, to Whose grace the beings bear witness and to Whose grandeur all created things testify. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ancient of Days.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty! O beloved of the heart! Your adorned letter arrived and from its delicate expressions were inhaled the fragrances of love and affection. Praise be to God that you have attained the most great favor time and again and have been blessed with the bounty of nearness and presence, which is the most glorious of divine bounties. There is no favor in divine knowledge greater than this, and no bounty higher or more excellent than this. We beseech His infinite grace and favor that He may ever cause that beloved one to abide beneath the shade of the Tree of divine protection and preservation, and guard him from the evil of the people of tyranny and pride, and adorn him with the robe of grace and mercy, and sustain him from the Salsabil of generosity and loving-kindness. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth and is gracious and all-knowing toward His loved ones. Although after prolonged days of separation the period of reunion also passed briefly, yet thanks must be offered that in these times, despite the multitude of enemies and the opposition of the people of tyranny and wickedness and the paucity of helpers and the attacks of the wicked, He made possible the means of meeting beneath the Tree and made His loved ones happy with this bounty. His is the praise and glory and grandeur and majesty and power and eternity. My God and my Lord and my Support! I beseech Thee by Thy comprehensive grace and Thy mighty favor to assist Thy loved ones in remembering Thee and praising Thee and thanking Thee in the places of Thy bounties, and preserve them in the shelter of Thy protection from the evil of the most wretched among Thy creatures, and grant them the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Furthermore, the press of occupations prevents lengthy writing. Convey to the friends of God, one and all, wondrous and sublime remembrances, especially to Mirza Ali-Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God. The rest of the spirit and glory be upon thee and upon thy family.</p>

<p>with Wisdom and Utterance!</p>
<p>O Hasan! Hearken unto the Call of Husayn Who hath been incarcerated in the Prison Fortress of ’Akka by reason of that which the hands of the heedless have wrought. If one were to question them, “by what reason have ye imprisoned Him?”, they would reply: “Verily, He hath come with a new Shariah and this new Shariah doth not accord with the Law under which we have been. To this matter testifieth our Book which is called the Qur’an, a Book that is from God, the Lord of all mankind. See that which the All-Merciful hath revealed therein: ‘Verily He is the Messenger of God, and the Seal of the Prophets.’”</p>
<p>To this We reply: “Indeed thou speaketh the truth. We do testify that through Him, Messengership and Prophethood have both been sealed and any one claiming after Him this most exalted station is in manifest error. Nevertheless, O Questioner! Hearken unto My voice which sayeth:”Open thine eyes that thou mayest behold the Most Great Beauty, through Whom speaketh the Lord of divine decree. By God! Through Him the ‘Hour’ hath appeared, and the ‘Resurrection’ hath come to pass, and the ‘Moon’ hath been cleft asunder and thou wouldst behold all in a ‘continuing Regeneration’ if thou be of them that possess insight.</p>
<p>“Verily, through His Advent hath come to be fulfilled the Advent about which glad tidings have been given by the Messengers of God from all eternity and there hath come to pass about which God hath revealed in the Qur’an: ‘On that Day they shall all rise before the Lord of mankind.’ Truly the Cycle of Prophethood hath been rolled up and He Who hath sent down the Prophets hath come, arrayed with a manifest and perspicuous sovereignty. He, verily, is the One at Whose Advent all created things have given this utterance: ‘The Kingdom is God’s, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the All-Praised.’ He is the One for Whom the necks of God’s Chosen Saints have been outstretched in longing and ardent expectation and every Prophet hath awaited His Presence in this wondrous Day. He is the One through Whom the ‘One Unseen and Hidden’ hath been made manifest, the One Whom no one hath known save He Himself, the one King over all mankind. Peruse ye the Qur’an and all God’s Books revealed in the past that haply ye may recognize this Day, illumined by the Countenance of thy Lord, the Manifest, the Perspicuous One.”</p>
<p>Thus have We illumined the horizon of the firmaments of this Tablet with the Luminary of Our Word, a Word through which God hath brought into being all creation from all eternity to all eternity. Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds!</p>

<p>O Samandar! If thou wert to become aware of My grief, thou wouldst surely weep for My sake at what hath been inflicted upon Me by those who claim to love Me. The oppressor hath committed that which hath caused My heart and My Pen to lament, and tears have fallen from the eyes of justice in My days. Commerce and occupation have diverted him from the remembrance and praise of God, and prevented him from justice and fairness in His days. By the life of God! He hath denied My favor, My grace and My loving-kindness, and hath clung to that which hath erased the white spot of love from his heart. We opened before his face the gates of blessing and bounty, yet he denied them and rejected God’s grace and favor, and said that which none before him had ever said. The Most Exalted Pen of God beareth witness to this in this mighty, exalted station.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have made mention of those whom thou didst desire Us to remember, and have sent down for them that which hath caused the ocean of forgiveness to surge before the face of the All-Merciful and the fragrance of pardon and generosity to waft from the right hand of thy Lord’s bounty, the All-Giving, the Merciful. We have sent down clear verses for him who was named Muhammad-’Ali who hath ascended unto God, and We make mention at this time of My handmaiden who hath sought the Supreme Horizon. We beseech God, exalted be He, to send down upon her a blessing from the heaven of His grace and a mercy from the clouds of His generosity, and to cause her to enter the most exalted Paradise. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. And We make mention of him who was named Husayn-’Ali and give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s loving-kindness and grace which encompassed him when the Pen moved to make mention of him. We testify that he attained unto the light of reunion and drank the choice wine of nearness from the hand of bounty and favors. Upon them be My glory and My loving-kindness, and the glory of those in My Kingdom, and the glory of those who have turned unto the Countenance and circled round the Throne, and the glory of those near ones and the sincere ones, and the glory of all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p>

<p>O seeker! Hear the Call from the upraised Lote Tree beyond the crimson sea upon the luminous spot, that there is no God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed. He hath cast aside what the people desired and hath manifested what He desired as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Neither the doubts of the divines nor the authority of princes can hinder Him. He summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the worlds. He desireth naught save to manifest that which draweth all nigh unto Him. To this testify the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, then those who circle round the House at morn and eventide. This is not the day of questioning - when thou hearest the Call from Mine exalted horizon, arise and say: “Here am I, O Desire of the world! Here am I, O Thou in Whose grasp lieth the reins of the heavens and earth!”</p>

We answer thee with this perspicuous Book, which God hath made a guide for His servants and a light for those who have lost their way, and a fire that proclaimeth: “There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beautiful.”</p>

I testify to that which Thy Most Exalted Pen and the Tongue of Thy Grandeur have spoken, O Lord of all beings and King of the throne on high and of earth below. And I testify to Thy oneness and singleness, and to that which Thy Messengers and Thy Chosen Ones have brought. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by the Most Great Name, whereby the limbs of the idolaters trembled and the faces of the monotheists shone forth, to make me turn toward the horizon of Thy Manifestation and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Orient of Thy inspiration. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward the lights of Thy countenance and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to withhold me from the ocean of Thy utterance and the sun of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace.

Be thou vocal in My praise, hold fast unto My cord, cling to the hem of My mercy, be detached from all else save Me, and be adorned with the fear of God, the Lord of all worlds.

Although the Truth, exalted be His glory, is manifest with utmost revelation and wondrous new rivers flow from the right hand of the Throne, all remain deprived and forbidden. This has been and will continue to be the cause and reason for this most great veil. O ’Ali! Bestow upon all contingent beings from the pure waters of the Kawthar of divine knowledge, that these earthly, transient conditions may be entirely removed and hearts may become powerful and firm through divine might. One who is sanctified from selfish conditions and shows perfect love and kindness to all people in the world will surely not be seized by fear nor disturbed by the conflicts of the earthly realm. Convey greetings from the Truth to all and say: if you truly succeed in hearing a single call, or drink but one drop from this ocean, you will surely behold the entire world as a handful of dust. By My life! Then neither sorrows would seize you nor would you experience any disturbance. Thus has your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, testified. God willing, preserve all your stations through the Name of God. Say: Beware, beware lest you deprive yourselves of that which has been ordained for you in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. All tribulations and afflictions that have been visited upon the path of God are remembered with Him and recorded in the Book. Know your worth, for you have attained to that which the distinguished and the pillars have been observed to be heedless of. Say: Give thanks unto your Lord, the Generous Bestower. O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be the Glory of the Lord of Destiny from the prison, and He says: The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the Name of God and acted according to what the All-Merciful has revealed in His perspicuous Book.</p>

<p>O Fadlu’llah! The Kingdom of grace is manifest, the Most Exalted Pen is speaking, and the horizon of the heaven of utterance is illumined and radiant with the Sun of meanings. Yet the people are seized with such a drunkenness that pen and tongue are powerless to comprehend or reckon it. Blessed is the soul that arose for the sake of God, spoke for the sake of God, and engaged in service to His Cause for the sake of God. Such a one is among the people of the Crimson Ark, whose mention was recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’.</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! Arise to champion the Cause of God with unity and harmony. A Cause has appeared that has had and has no likeness or parallel. Say: Fear the one true God and deprive not yourselves of the breezes of His days. By God! That which had never appeared in creation has now appeared. Blessed is the soul that has not been held back by doubts or allusions. Today the rain of generosity is pouring down, the sun of grace is shining forth, and all things are crying out “Come! Come ye!” Deprive not yourselves. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who summons you while under the talons of hatred, as beareth witness to this the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.</p>

Blessed is the speaker whom the roaring of the divines did not deter, and blessed is the one who turned toward God, whom neither the opposition of the clergy nor the might of rulers held back from the Truth. Great indeed is this Day - all the pens of the world are powerless to describe and incapable of reckoning it. Thus did the Pen speak when the Ancient of Days was seated upon the throne of utterance with manifest sovereignty.</p>

Fate prevented him from attaining the presence of the Lord of all beings, and he ascended on the path to the abode of the Guide, where the mercy of his Lord embraced him, until it caused him to enter the Most Exalted Paradise, as a bounty from His presence. Verily, He is the One Whose grace hath encompassed what was and what shall be. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to forgive him through His bounty and to send down upon him, in the nights and days, mercy from His presence. Verily, He is the Possessor of Bounty and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen.

<p>O Muhammad Taqi! God shall increase thy recompense on account of thy son who hath ascended unto Him. My son, Mihdi, in like manner, took his leave of this world soon after Our arrival in this prison.</p>
<p>O Muhammad Taqi! The world is sorely agitated and enshrouded with dust. Its ordeals have taken precedence over its peace, its wrath hath surpassed its grace, and its afflictions have exceeded its delight. It is the object of desire of the heedless, while the discerning despise it. Peace and security are found therein as rarely as the philosophers’ Stone, whilst its calamities continue to mount beyond enumeration. Man is compelled to behold in this world what he wisheth not to see, and he is obliged to associate closely with those whose presence he abhoreth. Had this world any significance, thou wouldst behold Me established upon its thrones, and had it any value, its Creator and Sovereign would not have turned away therefrom. Leave it to its people that its sadness may not overcome thee or its vanities please thee. Its glory is abasement, its riches are poverty, and its constancy is ephemeral. Where is the splendor of Parviz and his golden hoard, where is the leisure of the powerful and their tall mansions, where is the wealth of the tyrants and their serried hosts? Wert thou to see the palace of Khosrow today, thou wouldst find it barren save for the reverberations of the echo and the spider’s web.</p>
<p>Profit by their example, O thou endued with understanding, and grieve not over that which hath befallen thee. Thus do We comfort and console thee and admonish thee to be patient and long-suffering. Verily, thy Lord is the Ordainer, the Unconstrained.</p>
<p>We do not mean by “the world” anything more than its people, for as it is in itself, it is the ground which supporteth My steps, the pasture for My flock, the panorama of My chosen ones, the dawning-place of the evidences of My power, and the manifestation of My most excellent names and exalted attributes. Verily, thy Lord is the Expounder, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, rest upon him who hath ascended unto the realm on high and entered beneath the shelter of the providence of his Lord, the Master of this world and the next, the King of the Throne above and the earth below, and upon those who have not allowed the affairs of this world to alarm them in the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

He mentions thee with a mention before which all mentions bow down, and turns to thee from His Most Great Prison as a bounty from Him, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Master of all necks. When the Promise came and the Promised One appeared, each party clung to what it possessed of idle fancies and vain imaginings. They cast the command of God behind their backs, hastening to the dawning-places of conjecture. They are indeed among the wayward in the Book of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not those who have turned away from the Countenance, who followed every heedless doubter. Cast aside what ye possess. By God! The horizon of Revelation hath been illumined, the Desired One hath come, and that which was hidden from time immemorial hath been manifested. Fear God and refute not the truth by what ye possess. Answer Him Who hath stood before all faces and called all to the horizon of proof. Say: By the life of God! The proof hath been perfected, the bounty completed, and the heavenly table sent down. Draw nigh, O people, with humility and contrition. Let not the riches of the world and the might of nations prevent you. Turn with radiant faces to the Most Exalted Horizon. This is what ye have been commanded by Him with Whom is the Mother Book. This is a Day wherein all things proclaim: The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Most Glorious, the All-Forgiving. This is a Day whereof God gave glad-tidings to His servants aforetime through the tongue of the Messengers, and revealed its mention in the Books, Psalms and Tablets. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the trace of the Most Exalted Pen and been mentioned by the Lord of all being while He was in the hands of those who denied God’s favor after its revelation and rejected Him Who came from the horizon of proof with verses that equal not what the princes possess. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thus hath the Treasury of Knowledge revealed the pearls of utterance and the Sun of Proof its effulgence and lights. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the Robe in the evening and at dawn.</p>

<p>O Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. O Mahmud! The All-Loving remembereth thee from this praiseworthy station and summoneth thee unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have heard thy cry and lamentation in the days of thy Lord and We know thy condition. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He hath heard thy call and hath answered thee with that which all the treasures of the earth cannot equal. Rejoice thou and be of them that are thankful. The world and whatsoever is therein shall perish. Where are the Caesars and their palaces? Where are the Pharaohs and their might? Where are the tyrants and their dominion? They have returned from their palaces to their tombs. Verily thy Lord is the Remembrancer, the All-Wise. Where is the Prime Minister of Iran and his pride? Where is his grandeur and his power? Where is his beaming smile and his decisive command and his pampered form? He hath returned to his abode, fearful, agitated, trembling from the fear of God, the Lord of all worlds. We bear witness that he showed a measure of love and in his final days there appeared from him nothing that would sadden the Ancient Beauty in this mighty Revelation. O Mahmud! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee. Rather rejoice in this clear remembrance. Give thanks unto God for having made known unto thee this Cause from which every doubting learned one hath been debarred. Verily thou hast been remembered before the Wronged One and the glance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing, hath been directed towards thee. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of the world! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name through which every door was opened and every tongue did speak and every poor one was enriched, to ordain for me what beseemeth Thy greatness and Thy power and Thy generosity and Thy favors. O my Lord! I am he who hath turned unto Thee and hath placed his trust in Thee. Ordain for me what shall profit me in Thy worlds. Verily Thou knowest what is within myself while I know not what is within Thyself. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

<p>O Thou Whose remembrance is the delight of the souls of all them that yearn after Thee, Whose name is the exultation of the hearts of all who are wholly devoted to Thy will, Whose praise is cherished by such as have drawn nigh unto Thy court, Whose face is the ardent desire of all them that have recognized Thy truth, Whose trial is the healer of the sicknesses of them who have embraced Thy Cause. Whose calamity is the highest aspiration of such as are rid of all attachment to any one but Thyself!</p>
<p>Glorified, immeasurably glorified art Thou, in Whose hands is the empire of whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth, Thou, Who through but one word of Thy mouth, caused all things to expire and dissolve asunder, and Who, by yet another word, caused whatever had been separated to be combined and reunited! Magnified be Thy name, O Thou Who hast power over all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth, Whose dominion embraceth whatsoever is in the heaven of Thy Revelation and the kingdom of Thy creation. None can equal Thee in Thy created realms; none can compare with Thee in the universe Thou hast fashioned. The mind of no one hath comprehended Thee, and the aspiration of no soul hath reached Thee. I swear by Thy might! Were any one to soar, on whatever wings, as long as Thine own Being endureth, throughout the immensity of Thy knowledge, he would still be powerless to transgress the bounds which the contingent world hath set for him. How can, then, such a man aspire to wing his flight into the atmosphere of Thy most exalted presence?</p>
<p>He, indeed, is endued with understanding who acknowledgeth his powerlessness and confesseth his sinfulness, for should any created thing lay claim to any existence, when confronted with the infinite wonders of Thy Revelation, so blasphemous a pretension would be more heinous than any other crime in all the domains of Thine invention and creation. Who is there, O my Lord, that, when Thou revealest the first glimmerings of the signs of Thy transcendent sovereignty and might, hath the power to claim for himself any existence whatever? Existence itself is as nothing when brought face to face with the mighty and manifold wonders of Thine incomparable Self.</p>
<p>Far, immeasurably far, art Thou exalted above all things, O Thou Who art the King of Kings! I entreat Thee by Thy Self and by them Who are the Manifestations of Thy Cause and the Day-Springs of Thine authority to write down for us that which Thou hast written down for Thy chosen ones. Withhold not from us that which Thou didst ordain for Thy loved ones, who, as soon as Thy call reached them, hastened unto Thee, and when the splendors of the light of Thy countenance were shed upon them, instantly prostrated themselves in adoration before Thy face.</p>
<p>We are Thy servants, O my Lord, and in the grasp of Thy power. If Thou chastisest us with the chastisement inflicted upon the former and the latter generations, Thy verdict would be assuredly just and Thine act praiseworthy. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. None other God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Should the effects of the Most Exalted Pen be limited to but a single word, that word would endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. Every person of insight hath testified to this, and every person of understanding hath borne witness. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to such favor on a day when the people of the earth were seen to be heedless and turned away.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and that what hath flowed from Thy Pen is better for me than whatsoever wealth and children Thou hast bestowed upon me. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all things, to assist me unto that which shall be a light unto me in every world of Thy worlds. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I testify that I know not what profiteth me. Thou art more knowing than I. Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy trusted ones who turned with radiant faces toward Thy most exalted horizon while the people were in manifest rejection. Then I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy love, and resolute in Thy religion. Thou art verily the Almighty, the Powerful, the Glorious, the All-Wise. Furthermore I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to ordain for me to attain Thy presence and to stand before Thy door, or to inscribe for me from the Pen of Thy grace the reward of attaining Thy presence.

<p>In the Name of the Peerless Object of all desire! O Muhammad-Husayn, upon whom be the Glory of God! This Day is the Day whereof all Prophets and Messengers have, from the Lord of the worlds, given glad-tidings unto all peoples. Even as the proof of the Interlocutor of the Mount was manifested through the rod, so hath the proof of this Wronged One shone forth through the Pen. With but a single rod did He smite the swords of the world, and with but a single Pen hath this Revelation [conquered] all peoples. And in another instance, the proof of Moses was the Torah, and the evidence that remained of Christ was and is the leaves of the Gospel, and the enduring testimony of the Seal of the Prophets was the Book of the Furqan, which distinguished between truth and falsehood. Glory be to God! Now there hath appeared and been made manifest that which equalleth all the heavenly Books of the past and future, that concerning which every person of insight hath testified that it hath no peer or likeness. Nevertheless, the people remain veiled from the divine Day and deprived of the sealed wine. Today, whosoever desireth to enter the depths of the ocean of divine oneness must sanctify his heart from the stories of old, that the effulgences of the Sun of Truth may shine upon it and illumine it. O Muhammad-Qablih-Husayn! Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils and turned toward the horizon of thy Lord’s Revelation, the Lord of all men. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Desire of the nations, for having given me to drink from the ocean of Thy knowledge, and made me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, and guided me to Thy path. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word, which Thou hast made as a light unto them that have drawn nigh and as a fire unto them that have turned away, to make me speak forth Thy praise and call out Thy Name amidst Thy creation. O my Lord! Leave me not to myself. Preserve me through Thy power that hath encompassed all created things, and through Thy command that hath pervaded all existence, from vain imaginings and idle fancies. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Thus do We cast upon thee that which shall make thee steadfast in the Cause. Those who believed not in God and in what was revealed unto Ali before Nabil - these have denied God’s favor and turned away from a Beauty mighty and luminous. And when it is said unto them: “By what proof did ye believe in God?” they will say: “By what was revealed unto him.” Yet when that by which they seek to prove their faith is recited unto them, their faces turn black. What aileth these people that they can scarce comprehend any utterance? Thus have We expounded the verses unto thee and revealed unto thee that which shall make thee steadfast in the Cause, though all the world should oppose thee. Free thyself from the veils of fancy and desire that thou mayest soar with Me in this atmosphere that encompasseth all created things. We have sent unto thee that wherewith We have cleansed Our hands, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord, and be filled with joy and gladness supreme.

I beseech You, O King of Kings, Merciful to the servant, Sovereign of the realms of might and kingdom, by Your Beloved One through Whose advent You honored the heavens of Your power and spread the signs of Your oneness among Your servants, and by the waves of the ocean of Your knowledge among religions in the contingent world, to assist Your servants in that which You have commanded them in Your Book, then enable them to perform what You have ordained for them through Your binding command and Your firm decree. By Your might, O Ultimate Goal of the mystics and Purpose of the sincere ones, this Wronged One has in all conditions held fast to the cord of Your commandments and ordinances. I beseech You to enable Him to perform such deeds whereby You distinguish between the obedient and the rebellious, truth and falsehood, light and darkness. O my Lord! Enable Your servants to do what You love and are pleased with, and ordain for them the good of this world and the next. I testify that You have commanded Your creation to that which draws them near to You and preserves them from the evil of self and passion, and from tyranny and wickedness. I testify that Your power has encompassed all created things and Your mercy has preceded all contingent beings. I beseech You not to disappoint those who have set their faces toward the gate of Your grace, nor the sincere ones from the wonders of Your bounty and generosity. Verily You are the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Your letter was received. God has commanded all to righteousness and piety, and forbidden them from tyranny and wickedness. O servant, patience and protection of the child is necessary. Peace be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>In the name of the peerless Lord! Numerous Tablets were previously sent through messengers, with the purpose that you might arise to serve the Cause of God and quicken lifeless, withered souls through the divine fragrances. These days have no likeness or equal. Soon all that is visible will become non-existent and lost. It is necessary, nay incumbent upon one such as yourself to offer in these days, through the blessed name of the Self-Subsisting, the sealed wine to the heedless servants, that perchance those who are lost in the valley of error and deprivation may turn to the horizon of the All-Merciful and drink from the water of life. The Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Lord of Names, is imprisoned in ’Akka and, despite countless afflictions, summons at all times the people of creation to the truth. The more severe the trials, the louder His call. It hath been heard: “Tribulation hath not prevented the Baha from that which God hath commanded Him, the Lord of Names. He speaketh at all times: ‘There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.’ Arise to make mention of God and to aid His Cause in such wise that souls and minds will take flight. We love to see thee among those whom no blame of the blamer nor scorn of the scorner nor rejection of any heedless one deterreth in God. The world and all that is therein shall perish, and there shall endure for thee what appeareth from thee in service to thy Lord, Who overshadoweth all that was and shall be. Remind the servants with joy and fragrance, that perchance they may arise from slumber and turn unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus have We illumined the horizon of utterance with the sun of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that it may attract thee to the praiseworthy station. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have cast away the world and turned toward God with befitting submission.”</p>

<p>Today all enkindled souls who have drunk from the cup of divine love and partaken of the ocean of inner meanings must arise to serve the Cause and guide people to the Most Great Announcement and the Straight Path. This exalted rank and most high station has been and continues to be reserved for the learned ones - those scholars who have turned to the supreme horizon and attained the highest summit, which is the station of recognition of God, exalted be His glory. They are as lights for the darkness of the earth and as stars for the heavens of understanding. Every learned one who today has attained the divine fragrances of these days is as the eye for the temple of the world. Trusting in the All-Merciful, he must engage in teaching the Cause with the utmost joy and delight. This is the deed that will accompany him through all worlds. Some scholars today have deprived the helpless people of the Euphrates of divine mercy and the fountain of heavenly grace, while barring themselves from the eternal outpourings of God. Others have succeeded in hearing the rustling of the Divine Lote Tree and the scratching of the Supreme Pen, and have arisen to serve the Cause in such wise that God Himself bears witness: these are the people of the Crimson Ark whose names have been inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! God willing, you will, through divine confirmations, illuminate the horizons of those regions with the light of faith and bestow the water of steadfastness, that perchance the weakness of the people may be transformed to strength and their agitation to tranquility. Verily your Lord has power over all things. He does what He wishes and ordains what He desires. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>O Ali, son of him who ascended unto God, upon both of you be the Glory of God! Today the clouds of oppression have veiled the rays of the Sun of Justice, and outward means have so deluded the heedless that they have risen up to contend and dispute, and with utter tyranny have arisen, vainly imagining they can extinguish the light of the Divine Unity and quench the fire of the Divine Tree. Far, far from it! After all the strivings and endeavors of Pharaoh and his people, Moses appeared from his very household, despite his will. The hand of God is above their hands, and He is the Subduer over His servants, and He is the Mighty One whom neither the might of the world can weaken nor the clamor of the nations frighten. Verily He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is he who remembereth thee - verily for him is a station with God, the Lord of the worlds. And blessed art thou for having heard and turned and responded to thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O friends! We counsel all to that which is the cause of the exaltation of the Word of God. The hosts which have been and shall forever be victorious and triumphant are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Blessed are they who with these hosts have conquered the citadels of hearts. Beseech ye God to protect His friends from harmful deeds and to confirm them in that which befitteth His days. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>We have indeed mentioned thy father in numerous Tablets with a mention that nothing on earth can equal. To this testifieth He Who speaketh in every state that there is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Those who turned away after the clear proofs came unto them wander in the wilderness of doubt. But those who turned towards Him - upon them hath shone the Sun of Certitude from the horizon of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Can those who turn away find any refuge? Nay, by the Lord of the heavens! They have taken their own desires as a god besides God. Soon shall they find themselves in the lowest depths. When it is said to them “By what proof did ye believe in the Bayan?” they say “Because we found from it the fragrance of the All-Merciful.” Say: Why then did ye turn away from Him by Whose single word was suspended all that was revealed in the Bayan? They are like those who grasp the letters but cast away the meanings. Verily they are in darkness.</p>
<p>If they deny My mention, can any mention of them remain in the Bayan? Nay, by the Knower of hidden things! The entire Bayan is adorned with My Name and embellished with My mention. Ponder, O people of fairness! The Bayan is as a niche and My mention is its lamp, which the All-Merciful hath lit in creation. Say: Hasten unto it, O followers of religions! Whoso denieth Me hath denied God and His Messengers. To this testifieth He before Whom the verses bow down.</p>
<p>This is not the day to tarry. Hasten with your hearts toward the direction of the Throne. This is the Purpose with which the Tablets have been sealed. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having cast aside the servants and taken hold of the Lord of all being. Hold fast unto Him - verily He will protect thee in truth. Thy Lord is the Judge in the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>Can what We have kindled be extinguished by the waters of rejection? Nay, by the Causer of causes! Soon shall its lights encompass the horizons. Verily thy Lord is the Protector over what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. What thou didst send hath been presented before the Throne and We have accepted it.

Within His grasp lies the dominion of all things, and in His right hand the reins of all beings. Can anyone oppose Him? Nay, by His Own Self, the Mighty, the Bestower! They that have turned away, these shall have no mention with God - verily they are among the dead. Soon shall the breezes of torment seize them from every direction. Thy Lord is indeed severe in punishment.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear the call of this Wronged One, Who hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities because He summoned mankind unto God, the Subduer of winds. From the horizon of the prison He calleth unto all who are in earth and heaven, saying: The Promised One hath come with sovereignty and majesty. Turn ye unto Him, O people! Beware lest ye follow every doubting idolater. They that have followed Satan have no portion this Day save that they are companions of the fire - they walk in the valley of fire and perceive it not. From their mouths issue forth flames of fire yet they know it not. God shall soon seize them with His might. He is verily the Powerful over what He willeth, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Grieve thou not over anything. Trust in God in thy affairs. Say: O my Lord! I have turned my face unto Thee and raised unto Thee the hands of my hope. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the servants and all who dwell in the lands to send down upon Thy trusted ones that which will gladden their hearts and tranquilize their souls.

He hath made mention of thee in such wise as all the treasures of the earth cannot equal, as doth testify He Who speaketh that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thy letter hath arrived and was presented by the servant in attendance. We have answered thee through this wondrous letter. O Andalib! Thy letter arrived and was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and in these days of sorrow became a source of joy and gladness. And this utterance of thine was most acceptable: “My God! I disavow that worship which leadeth me to pride, and I desire that sin which bringeth me to contrition.” Although all that thou didst write was a cause of joy and delight, yet unto this utterance We accorded a special station. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. O Andalib! We have made thee to be aided in My remembrance and praise and service to My Cause, and a bearer of glad-tidings amongst My servants. In all conditions fix thy gaze upon the Truth and speak for the sake of Truth. Ere long shall the saplings that have been planted bring forth wondrous and sublime fruits in the world. This is a glad-tiding from Our presence that thou mayest rejoice and be among the thankful ones. Multiple Tablets have been revealed in thy name. God willing, thou shalt attain unto them all and act according to that which befitteth thee and My Cause. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor.

He hath ordained for thee from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall gladden the hearts of them that are nigh. Blessed be thy father and thy mother. God hath brought forth from them a righteous deed. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon whosoever hath heeded thy word in this mighty and sublime Cause.

At times He calleth out with the perspicuous tongue, and at other times He pointeth with the finger of certitude, summoning all unto God, the Lord of all men. Were We to recount what hath befallen Us, the heavens would be cleft asunder and the mountains would crumble. They who denied Him prided themselves in their titles. The mute one named himself the Most Holy and claimed within himself what the slinking whisperer claimed, while another named himself the Sword of Truth and declared “I am the conqueror of lands.” God raised up one who smote him upon his mouth, that all might be assured that he was but the tail of Satan, severed by the sword of the All-Merciful. He had awaited the days of his glory and manifestation according to the promise of him who denied God, the Cleaver of the daybreak. Thus doth God seize him who turneth away from Him and riseth to waste His Cause amongst His servants. When they perished, the spring breezes wafted and the gates of heaven were opened and the clouds rained down. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the knowledge of God in His days and hath detached himself wholly from all else. Say: Doth not the Lord of the heavens and earth suffice you?

O My handmaiden!

She chose the polytheists as a helper for herself instead of God and set aside her Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, and severed her connection with God and clung to relationship with the polytheists. Alas for her in that she exchanged the beauty of the All-Merciful for a son of the world and sold the Joseph of God for dirhams and dinars.

We have been informed of what befell you in the path of God, and We were present when thy father was martyred for his love of God, the Creator of the heavens and earth. Blessed is he in that his face was crimsoned in the love of God and he attained unto this glorious and sublime station. Think not that he is dead. By God! He is alive in the Most Sublime Horizon within the kingdom of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Whereupon the Supreme Pen addresseth him from the presence of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious: Upon thee, O thou who art martyred in the path of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, be the glory of God and His praise, and the glory of all who dwell in the Kingdom of Names, and the glory of all things at all times. I testify that thou didst fulfill the Covenant of God and His Testament, and didst speak His praise, and wert steadfast in His Cause whereby hearts were troubled and the tribes did wail, except such as held fast to the cord of the loving-kindness of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. Blessed is he who visiteth thee, by virtue of what hath been revealed in this imperishable, mighty and wondrous Tablet.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses and made mention of thy father, that Our successful servants might visit him. The glory of God rest upon him and upon thee, from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Send thou this Tablet to thy place that the servants of God there may read it and be numbered among those who remember.</p>

O thou who art lost in love for Me! Walk thou in the paths of My love in quest of My beauty. O thou who art attracted to Me! Be not still, but hasten unto Me in thy longing for My presence.

<p>In His Name, the One Who standeth without transition! O Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned towards the court of the Ancient of Days and set his face toward his Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One, that the Call may draw him to the Dayspring of Names and cause him to speak in praise of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Thy letter had previously come before the holy presence, and We answered thee with verses that all contingent beings cannot equal, but they reached thee not until numbered years had passed. And now thy letter hath come again and been honored by the glance of thy Lord’s grace, the Mighty, the Bountiful. O servant! Say to the concourse of the Jews: Your appointed time hath been fulfilled - where then is the Promised One? Bring Him forth if ye be of the learned! Among them are those who are perplexed within themselves, whose inner voice addresseth them saying: “The Promise hath come to pass, yet we see not the Promised One.” Say: Break asunder, O company of the froward, the chains of limitation! Verily He ruleth upon the throne of David with majesty and power. All the appointed times have ended, yet the peoples await the appearances of their vain imaginings. Say: He hath appeared in truth with a sovereignty that no veils can obstruct. My people are asleep. Blessed art thou for having been awakened by the Call when it was raised from the Divine Lote-Tree planted in the white spot, and for having hearkened unto it while most of the servants turned away. The Holy Land hath been honored by the advent of the Lord of all creation, and the Mount hath been illumined with the lights of the Manifestation, yet the people remain veiled by following vain imaginings. Say: Rend asunder that which preventeth you from the Dawning-Place of Beauty, and turn ye to the Kawthar of reunion bestowed by the Lord of the beginning and the end. Thus hath warbled the Dove of Utterance upon the branch of inner meanings and exposition, as a grace from the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Quickener of the dead!” Be thou assured by thy Lord’s favor, then stand firm in the Cause and be a herald of this Name through which religions have been overturned.</p>

<p>O Word of Victory! Bear thou witness even as God hath testified in the heaven of eternity that there is none other God but Him, and that ’Ali is the Manifestation of His Cause unto all created things, and that He hath appeared with the truth through clear signs which have rendered every person of great learning powerless to comprehend them. He hath delivered the messages of His Lord and hath made clear unto the servants that which He was commanded by One Who is All-Wise, All-Knowing. Through Him were made manifest the laws of God and His religion and His proof unto His creation and His grace unto all, whether small or great.</p>

Hearken unto the call of the Spirit from this blessed, divine and eternal Leaf, Which moveth in this Paradise and causeth the spirits of those near unto God to move with It. And when It moveth, there riseth from It the melody of the Spirit which draweth unto itself the hearts of them that have believed in God and His signs, and who have been illumined by the lights of His countenance. Thus doth the Dove make mention of thee on this night and give thee glad tidings of a holy and luminous paradise.</p>
<p>Know thou that We have heard and understood the afflictions and tribulations that have befallen thee, and that which hath come upon thee according to what was ordained by thy Lord’s Pen on a preserved tablet of glory. We have been partners in thy suffering and have grieved for thy sake. Be thou patient, then show forth yet more patience, for He will surely reward every patient and grateful one.</p>
<p>Blessed be they both in that they have drunk of the cup of camphor from the hands of light and have been made joyous in the holy paradise, and have found rest beneath an all-encompassing shade in a garden whose breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, wherein the Beauty was witnessed from Its horizon. Thus have We imparted unto thee that which will bring tranquility to thy spirit and gladden thy being, and cause thee to remain steadfast upon the path of love.</p>
<p>Then remind, from Us, thy brother and those who were with thee, that the grace from this servant may reach them and all the worlds in abundance. We beseech God at this moment to unite us with thee, for verily He hath power over all things. May the Spirit, glory and splendor rest upon thee and upon all who have believed in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy! O Nabil-i-’Ali! Hearken unto that which the Pen of Glory addresses thee with from the prison precincts on this night. Verily, He is the Stranger in the lands of destiny and the Wronged One in the hands of enemies, in the path of God, the King, the Mighty, the Beloved. By God! No morning dawns except that calamity overtakes Me, and no evening falls save that another tribulation touches Me. It is as though trials were created for My wronged Self alone, and whenever I move, affliction moves with Me, and when I rest and sleep, it never rests. Thus has the matter been decreed by the Pen of mighty destiny. As for the Youth, He shall never be dismayed by what befalls Him in the path of God, but rather shall drink from the cups of destiny the sealed choice wine of holiness. However, when We see those who were created by a word rise up in tyranny and calumny, and commit that which causes the Cause to be lost, My soul is troubled thereby, My skin crawls, and My wounded heart is agitated. Would that God might raise up one possessed of discernment who would perceive the fragrance of sorrows from the garment of the All-Merciful and become aware of what hath befallen Him at the hands of these ungrateful ones. Say: Through the garment of the former did Jacob’s sight return after he found therein the fragrance of his Beloved. Thus was the matter inscribed by the finger of mighty glory. And were the fragrance of sorrows to waft from the garment of God, those who have turned to God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, would surely perish thereby. And thou, O youth, though We have sent down unto thee words of sorrow, grieve not in thy soul, but put thy trust in God. Verily, He will protect His Cause and aid it, for He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. He doeth by His sovereignty that which every accursed polytheist is powerless to achieve. Rejoice thou in the joy of God, then stand firm in the Cause, and He will verily aid thee with the truth through victorious hosts. And glory be upon thee and upon every patient and grateful one.</p>

Whoso waiteth after this is among the distracted ones. Say: Through my manifestation the mention of God was exalted, and through it were created temples whose number none knoweth save God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. O concourse of the Spirit! Draw nigh with joy and fragrance unto the Temple of the All-Merciful. This behooveth you, if ye be of them that know. Beware lest ye be hindered by those servants who worship vain imaginings and are not among the perceiving ones. Say: Cast away vain imaginings - the All-Knowing hath come upon the clouds of glory, and they who are sincere in faith behold and say: Blessed be the Self-Subsisting Who hath come with manifest sovereignty. Say: Turn not unto the world and what is therein. Cast it behind you, turning unto your Ancient Lord. Say: Abandon the churches - the Church of God hath appeared upon the temple of man. Turn ye unto it, then remember it with this wise remembrance. Therein is raised the call of the Bell in His Holy Name, while ye remain dead within the veils of your selves. Arise from the couches of desire, turning unto God, the Lord of Names. This is what ye were promised in the Tablets, were ye of them that see.

As to those who seclude themselves in churches - did We create them for eating and sitting idle? Nay, by My mighty and loving Self! Rather for this Day wherein He Who was hidden hath appeared with His Name, the Protector of the worlds. Say: Present yourselves before your Lord and withhold not yourselves from that for which ye were created. This is of My grace unto you, if ye be of them that perceive.</p>

<p>As We were walking in the prison, there came from the heaven of utterance the Bird of Divine Knowledge, warbling in such wise as to draw unto it the hearts of those who have turned unto God, the Lord of Lords. We heard what it spoke and sent it to the Concourse on High with such mention as caused the sweet-scented breezes of the All-Merciful’s utterance to waft throughout all possibility. O Abdullah! Thou wert mentioned before the Wronged One and present before His face, as the Mother of the Bayan doth testify from the most exalted station. The Pen hath borne witness to thy presence before the countenance of the Ancient King. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Possessor of all existence. Grieve not at anything, for verily He is with thee and will guard thee with the hosts of the unseen and will inspire thee with that which will gladden thy heart and the hearts of them that are possessed of understanding. We have desired to give thee glad-tidings of a mercy that hath preceded existence. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. God hath forgiven thy father, and at My mention of him the oceans of gifts and favors surged. We adorned him at the time of his ascension with the ornament of My love and sent down for him that which brought solace to all eyes. We beseech God to send down upon him, at all times, a mercy from His presence, a blessing from His side, and sustenance from His court. He is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. He hath been mentioned by one who hath loved Me and soared in My atmosphere and arisen to serve Me and to make mention of Me amongst My servants. We testify that he hath taken for himself, beneath the canopies of My grandeur, a station whereunto none hath attained save him who hath sacrificed his spirit and all that he possessed in the path of God, the Lord of all religions. The glory shining forth from the horizon of My utterance be upon him and upon thee and upon all who have not been hindered by the veils of glory from turning to the All-Possessing, the Most High.</p>

<p>O Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious! We summon the servants unto God, their Lord and the Lord of all worlds. They have risen up to harm Me and hasten in the wilderness of error - nay, they are among the heedless ones. The Promised One hath appeared, yet they remain behind a thick veil, and the Desired One remembereth them, yet they persist in grievous delusion. Say: Turn ye towards the Supreme Horizon. He Who is the Manifestation of your Lord, the Lord of Names, hath appeared. Beware lest the veils of glory prevent you - rend them asunder through His Name, the Strong, the Trustworthy. Those who have disbelieved are the most ignorant among men, even should they possess all the knowledge of the earth. Thus hath the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, decreed. And they who have believed are the greatest in rank among men, the most perspicacious in mind, the keenest in vision, and the purest in heart. Thy Lord, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. The shepherd hath been mentioned before the Throne, while forgotten was he who possessed the treasures of the earth and enjoyed a mighty portion. This is a Day wherein We have made the highest among the people lowest, and the lowest highest. Thy Lord, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. How many were possessed of glory who were turned away from the door, and how many were abased who entered and attained, exclaiming: “Praise be to God Who hath made me to achieve this noble vision!” All affairs are in the grasp of thy Lord’s power - He turneth them as He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise. O servant! Give thanks to thy Lord for having been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen and for having attained unto this wondrous remembrance. None can draw nigh on this Day save through the heart. Thus hath the Lord of the worlds decreed. This earth hath been shaken by what the hands of the hypocrites have wrought. We, at the very center of tribulation, summon mankind unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Arise to make mention of Him and to praise Him, then be steadfast in the Cause through His Name, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Most Laudable. Glory be unto them that have turned towards Him and have said: “I believe in Thee, O Thou the Beloved of them that know!”</p>

<p>In the Name of the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing! God willing, may you gaze with the eye of the heart toward the most exalted horizon and hear with the ear of the spirit the call of the Beloved of all possibility. All people were awaiting the days of meeting, the appearance of the Dawning-Place of the Cause, the Lord of Names. But when the breeze of joy wafted and the Sun of manifestation rose from the horizon of the world, most of the people clung to their own vain imaginings and remained deprived of the Lord of all beings. Today the outward ear and eye do not suffice, for most souls are accounted as deaf and dumb before God, though outwardly possessing both. Strive that you may receive your portion of God’s infinite bounties. The world and all that is therein shall pass away, but there shall remain unto thee this mighty Tablet. Reflect upon the time of the appearance of the Divine Messengers and the Emissaries of God - most people did not even count those Dawning-Places of Divine Unity and Holy Manifestations among the believers, let alone any station above that. They have lost indeed who denied God’s manifestation and His sovereignty. Woe unto them for what they have earned in their vain life. God shall soon seize them with His wrath as He seized their like before. He is verily the Seizer, the Mighty, the Powerful. None should test his Lord. Reflect upon God’s manifestation and what hath appeared from Him - then shall you find yourself in a spirit of joy and fragrance and be assured through the grace of your Lord, the All-Bountiful. We have enjoined upon all what is right and forbidden what is wrong. Blessed is he who hath taken hold of God’s command and cast away all else - he is of the people of truth in a clear Book. Rend asunder the veils in the name of thy Lord and be of those who are firmly established. This is a Tablet that all the treasures of the world cannot equal. Read it by night and by day - through it will God uncover what was hidden from thee. He is verily the All-Bounteous, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

How excellent is the state of him who hath discovered from its fragrance the One to be recognized, and whom the congestion of self and desire hath not debarred from inhaling the divine fragrance. Render thanks unto the Adored One of all worlds that He hath enabled thee to attain unto this supreme bounty and mighty gift, and strive thou to remain steadfast in His love, for this station hath been and shall ever remain the most exalted of all stations.

It is most evident that whatsoever hath been and is mentioned hath for its purpose the elevation of God’s loved ones to holy spiritual stations, that through divine grace they may abide eternally in the immortal Kingdom. The world hath never had, nor doth it now possess, any worth. Had it possessed worth even less than an atom, the Ancient Beauty would never have been seen imprisoned in this most great humiliation - though this humiliation is the pride of all glory, and this prison the cause of freedom for all the peoples of the world. Ere long will its fruits be made manifest in the world of earthly dominion. God willing, mayest thou drink forever from the cup of the grace of the Lord of Glory.

<p>In the Name of the One Friend - O Sadiq! May you, God willing, attain to the Dawning-Place of truthfulness and be enabled to make mention of Him. The acceptance or rejection of all things hath ever been within the grasp of God’s power. Whatsoever He hath accepted hath been and shall ever be accepted by all, and whatsoever He hath rejected hath been and shall remain rejected. Today the truthful one is he who recognizeth the Dawning-Place of truth and cleaveth fast unto Him. Should someone perform all good and praiseworthy deeds, yet remain heedless of the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Day-Spring of inspiration, he would be accounted among the heedless before the Divine Throne. Likewise, should someone discourse upon all the divine Books and remind people of all the counsels sent down, yet fail to acknowledge the truth, he was not and is not truthful. God willing, mayest thou remain steadfast and firm in the Cause of the Lord of all beings with complete truthfulness. Strive thou to ignite those who are as extinguished lamps with the fire of divine ardor, and to give drink to those who thirst from this most pure wine which floweth from the direction of the Most Great Scene of Vision. Should anyone possessed of insight be found today who would read but one Tablet from among the divine Tablets and discover its warmth, he would arise with his whole being to serve the All-Merciful, closing his eyes to the world and all who dwell therein and opening them unto Him alone. O Sadiq! The Most Great Ocean is surging, the heaven of bounty is upraised, and the Sun of loving-kindness is shining. Say: O servants! While time remaineth, deprive not yourselves of the Most Glorious Wine, nor remain heedless, through vain imaginings, of the Dawning-Place of certitude. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless. God willing, mayest thou be so enkindled by the fire of the utterance of the All-Merciful that its warmth shall influence those who are with thee, that all may attain to the most great bounty and turn their faces toward the Countenance of the Ancient of Days.</p>

All people dwell at rest in their homes, while these Birds of the realm of detachment remain imprisoned and alone in their nests of solitude. In such circumstances, both the benefit and harm of friends and foes alike remain far removed from this most holy and exalted Sanctuary.</p>

His grace has ever been and will ever be upon you, God willing. However, O Ali, I swear by this Silent Speaker that if you were to become aware of the grief of these days that has befallen the Beloved, you would flee to the wilderness and detach your heart from all who dwell on earth. Yet my grief has rent asunder the garment of remembrance and cast off the robe of utterance from its temple, for it cannot be known through remembrance and utterance, nor can it become manifest. None save the Ancient Being is aware of it, nor can any reckon it. O Ali, forget not the days of attainment to My presence, and erase not the words of the Beloved from your heart. Consider the whole world as non-existent save those who have entered beneath the shadow of your Lord. Associate with My loved ones and be detached from My enemies. Be confident in God’s grace, for His bounty has seized you and will continue to seize you. Each day you are remembered before God. The glory from Us be upon you and upon your brother who was named Muhammad, that he may be among those who rejoice.

<p>O handmaiden of God, Ibn Abhar, upon whom be the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of destiny, He Who is sovereign over whatsoever He willeth! This is a letter from the Wronged One of the horizons to a leaf among the leaves of the Tree of divine knowledge, that the rapture of the utterance of the All-Merciful may carry her to a station wherein neither the insinuations of the wicked nor the doubts of the evil ones shall grieve her. O My handmaiden! By My life! Thou hast ever been and shalt continue to be beneath the glances of the loving-kindness of the Goal of the world’s desire, and thou shalt abide in the paradise of mention before His countenance. Time and again hath thy name flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and thou art mentioned in His presence. The princesses and noblewomen of the earth have not attained unto this station, save whom God willeth. Rejoice thou in My remembrance, for nothing in all existence can equal it. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of remembrance and utterance, and in Whose right hand are the reins of the kingdom of divine knowledge! I beseech Thee by the vessels of the ocean of Thy grandeur, and by the suns of the heavens of Thy grace and knowledge, to send down upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will preserve me from the mention of any save Thee and draw me nigh unto the pavilion of Thy glory and the tabernacle of Thy majesty. O my Lord! I am Thy handmaiden and the daughter of Thy handmaiden. Ordain for me from the Pen of generosity that which shall profit me among the peoples. Verily Thou knowest what is within my soul and my inmost being, and Thou knowest that which benefiteth me and preserveth me and draweth me nigh unto Thee. Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He pleaseth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O my Lord! Aid me to remember Thee and to praise Thee, then number me among Thy handmaidens who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and who have offered up their spirits in Thy love and Thy good-pleasure. O my Lord! I am the poor one who hath clung to the hem of Thy generosity and held fast to the cord of Thy bounty. Do with this handmaiden of Thine as beseemeth Thy generosity and grace. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!</p>

<p>Dispel my grief by Thy bounty and Thy generosity, O God, my God, and banish mine anguish through Thy sovereignty and Thy might. Thou seest me, O my God, with my face set towards Thee at a time when sorrows have compassed me on every side. I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all being, and overshadowest all things visible and invisible, by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts and the souls of men, and by the billows of the Ocean of Thy mercy and the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy bounty, to number me with them whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from setting their faces toward Thee, O Thou Lord of all names and Maker of the heavens!</p>
<p>Thou beholdest, O my Lord, the things which have befallen me in Thy days. I entreat Thee, by Him who is the Day-Spring of Thy names and the Dawning-Place of Thine attributes, to ordain for me what will enable me to arise to serve Thee and to extol Thy virtues. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, Who art wont to answer the prayers of all men!</p>
<p>And, finally, I beg of Thee by the light of Thy countenance to bless my affairs, and redeem my debts, and satisfy my needs. Thou art He to Whose power and to Whose dominion every tongue hath testified, and Whose majesty and Whose sovereignty every understanding heart hath acknowledged. No God is there but Thee, Who hearest and art ready to answer.</p>

<p>The Most Great, Most Holy, Most Glorious! The verses of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise, have been sent down unto the Leaf who, when she heard the call from the direction of supreme glory, turned and said: “Here am I, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!” We have sent thee each year that which hath diffused the fragrance of the garment of the Beloved among the worlds. Blessed is he who hath found its perfume and been so attracted as to speak His praise, detached from all else and turning to the Qiblih of existence and the Eye of the seen and the unseen. Verily, he is of the people of Baha, as inscribed in a Tablet by the Most Exalted Pen. Exalted is this holy, mighty and inaccessible station! The clouds pour down rain - blessed is the soil that hath been watered and hath cried out: “Praise be unto Thee, O Quickener of mouldering bones!” Can His outpouring ever be suspended? Nay, by the Beauty of the Beloved! Yet the people are in grievous error. Doth it befit anyone to pause when the All-Merciful calleth out in His loudest voice: “To Me, to Me, O people of earth and heaven!” Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh, and woe unto every heedless one who is far removed. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having been oft-times remembered before the All-Merciful, and for having had revealed in thy name Tablets that surpass all that existeth on earth. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Blessed is she who, being veiled, hath heard and responded, and woe unto him who, wearing a turban, hath grown proud and turned away from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. How many adults have been held back through following their desires, and how many children have attained the lights of guidance! Thus hath the decree been fulfilled and the Cause been made manifest from One Who is powerful and ancient. O My Leaf! Hearken once again unto the call from the direction of My grace and bounty: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Stand firm in the Cause, then remind My handmaidens on behalf of thy Lord. We have sent unto them that which shall gladden their eyes and attract the hearts of those who are endued with understanding. The glory that proceedeth from God, the Mighty, the Most Praised, be upon thee and upon them.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Wise! Exalted is He Who hath ordained for the people of Baha that which He hath not ordained for the people of creation. They are the dawning-places of certitude amidst all possible things. These are servants who have broken the chains of limitation through the shining of the lights of divine unity from the horizon of their Lord’s favor, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. These are the fruits of the Tree which hath been raised up in truth, and the lamps of guidance for all who dwell on earth and in the heavens. We beseech God to assist them in teaching His Cause through such detachment that the fragrance of the All-Merciful may waft therefrom throughout all worlds, and to protect them from the odors that emanate from the intimations of those who have denied God, the Revealer of verses. So mighty is this Cause that whenever mention is made of its greatness, the Pen is overwhelmed and swoons away, and when it recovers, it says: “Blessed is he who hath turned to the Face, detached from all else.” Reflect, O people, on what hath appeared in this Revelation that ye may behold yourselves in the most exalted station. Those who have remained remote, they have clung to idle fancy, turning away from guidance. We testify that they are among the people of error. We have summoned all people in every condition unto God. Among them are those who turned away, those who hesitated, and those who turned to the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. They who turned to Him are among the gems of creation, while they who turned away have no portion of the choice wine of their Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. God’s proof hath been perfected unto His creation and His testimony unto His servants - to this doth testify your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Whoso hath attained unto the remembrance of God in His days, he is of those who have attained unto all good and for whom there is a goodly end. O servant! Hearken unto the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, which hath been raised up in the Most Great Prison while the Ancient Beauty was in the hands of the wicked. We have created all things for the days of God, which have appeared and shone forth, yet the people remain heedless and veiled. Be thou therefore ever gazing toward the court of thy Lord and speaking His praise amongst His servants.</p>

<p>In the Name of the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous!</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, that the Dawning-Place of Revelation went forth from His inhabited house, directing His steps toward the house of His brother who was named Kalim, and there He secluded Himself for eight days and nights, which We completed with another night as a bounty from Our presence. And therein We opened the gates of reunion to the faces of the loved ones, and gave all to drink from the ocean of Thy reunion and the springs of Thy nearness and good-pleasure, such that whoso desired was present each day before the throne of Thy mercy, and each night before Thy countenance, and in every moment there shone upon them the lights of Thy face and the suns of Thy grandeur and power. O Lord! Make this reunion the fountain of steadfastness for their souls and the pure wine of certitude for their beings. O Lord! Illumine their hearts and sanctify their souls and make firm their feet, for Thy path is exceeding narrow, narrow - nay, finer than all that is fine. I beseech Thee, O Cleaver of the dawn and Subjugator of the winds, by Thy Name through which the luminary of prosperity shone forth upon the people of Thy kingdom, to make them detached from all else save Thee, taking refuge in Thy presence and clinging to the hem of Thy mercy. Then enable them, O my God, to arise to serve Thee. O Lord! Make known to them the excellence of Thy days, lest anything prevent them from that which hath been ordained for them in Thy dominion and Thy realm of might. Then send down upon them a blessing from Thy presence and a grace from the heaven of Thy bestowals. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Thou knowest, O my God, that in these days when his house was illumined by the lights of the Sun of Thy countenance, the Speaker arose to serve Thee and to circle round Thy throne. O Lord! Ordain for him and for those with him that which befitteth Thy grace and Thy favors and Thy generosity and Thy loving-kindness. Verily, Thou art He through Whose Name were raised the banners of bounty above the world and the standards of triumph amidst the nations. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p>He is the Ever-Abiding! These are the verses of holiness which have been sent down from the heaven of the Command to all who have believed in God and have attained. They speak amongst all created things with words that draw souls unto themselves and cause them to overflow. O Beauty of Victory! Hear the call of thy Lord from around this Tree which hath been raised up in truth, that the call may bring thee within the sanctuary of grandeur and guide thee to the place of security - that station wherein all faces are turned toward the Face of God and wherein all things are transformed and colored anew. O servant! Be at rest within thyself, then stand firm in the Cause in such wise that no wind shall move thee and no polytheist shall cause thee to slip, and purify thy face for God Who hath perfected His favor unto thee and made it to overflow. Say: O people! Dispute not about the verses of God when they are sent down in truth, nor about this Beauty through Whom the suns of the Command have shone forth and reached their fullness. We did aforetime send down unto thee Tablets wherein by a single letter hearts are guided and made to overflow. Beware lest thou cast the Book of God behind thy back or follow in this any polytheist who hath turned away and transgressed. Arise in the Cause, then stand firm and say: O people! If ye deny these verses, then by what sign did ye believe in God’s Messengers? Then shall ye hear from them what thou didst hear from the people of the Furqan when ’Ali came with clear signs and they said “This is naught but sorcery” whereby the hearts of those near unto God were cloven asunder. Even so did they speak before and do they speak in these days wherein the Calf doth call out and bray. Then make mention from Our presence unto thy brother Rida and say: O servant! Be thou content with thy Lord’s decree in this conclusive Proof, with whose appearance none was content save whom thy Lord willed. Thus doth God render vain the deeds of those who denied His grace and turned away from His beauty, then followed every base and clinging thing.</p>

<p>A Tablet revealed for Mirza Qasim. The Book hath been sent down from the presence of One mighty and all-knowing unto him who hath migrated unto God and whom tribulations have touched in his Lord’s path, even as was ordained for him in a preserved tablet. O servant! Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast attained the presence of the Beloved and heard with thine ears that for which countless souls have died in their yearning. Say: He hath appeared in truth from a glorious horizon. Say: O people! Do ye worship the calf and forsake Him by Whose command the sun hath dawned from the horizon of the name of the Most High, through Whom the Books have been sent down throughout all ages, and through Whom the treasuries of the Cause have appeared from One mighty and powerful? Fear ye God and deny not Him in Whom ye have believed, and all that ye have heard that He hath appeared from Our presence - thy Lord, the All-Knowing, is witness to what I say. Aid thy Lord with whatsoever thou canst, then shun every sinful idolator. Verily he who speaketh falsehood, he is Satan himself - guard yourselves against him, O My loved ones, and make for yourselves a path unto God. Say: With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth and the knowledge of all things, and He doth encompass all the worlds. Leave the creatures to themselves, then leave them in their vain imaginings and turn with a luminous face toward the dawning-place of a mighty Name. Say: He hath come without clouds or mists, and speaketh now amongst mankind with manifest sovereignty. Thus have We remembered thee in this Tablet that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and convey the Cause of thy Lord unto those who dwell in these regions, that they may take the All-Merciful as their friend. And when thou returnest with God’s Tablet unto thy dwelling-place, convey Our greetings unto those servants who have drunk the living waters from the cup of their Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Bestower, and who have remained firm upon the straight path. And the glory be upon thee and upon every pure and sincere believer.</p>

<p>The whole world was brought from nothingness into being for the presence before the Throne of the One Who conversed on Sinai. And when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace, all turned away and denied. Blessed is he who was not kept back from turning towards God by the opposition of the divines and rulers, and blessed is the steadfast one whom the winds of hatred and animosity did not disturb. Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and there was revealed from the Supreme Pen that which shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. We counsel thee to preserve it. One word from the exalted utterances that appears from the Dayspring of the pronouncement of the Lord of Names is, in the sight of God - exalted be His glory - superior to all that is observed on earth. All things that have been created - the ornaments of the world and its adornments, and likewise wife and children - all are divine bounties, but they are not lasting. The exalted word, however, is everlasting and enduring, and in every one of the divine worlds it is a steadfast helper and an unwavering companion to its possessor. It has been and ever shall be. “Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord’s sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.” We beseech God to assist thee and ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and profit thee. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy wisdom. I beseech Thee by the light which hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy grace to preserve me through Thy power and might, and to ordain for me that which will make me independent through Thy riches and steadfast in Thy Cause. Furthermore I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Educator of the nations, to ordain for me goodly offspring who will remember Thee among Thy creatures and aid Thee in Thy realm through wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>

<p>The essence of praise and its purest form befitteth Him Who is such a Sovereign that the kings of the world have gloried and continue to glory in being His servants. The order of the world and the tranquility of nations have depended and depend upon obedience to His commandments and prohibitions. Whosoever raised the standard of rebellion cast away his head, and whosoever held fast to obedience and submission won the prize. Consider the kings: some among them and their subjects have clung to the cord of self and passion, calling it law and politics and freedom, until gradually the foundation of divine laws was shaken among them, and this became the cause of chaos and confusion. As ye have heard, diverse parties appeared, each following its own desires, until distinction was obliterated and the horizons were set ablaze by the fire of discord and dissension–a conflagration that turned hope to despair. Tranquility departed and perturbation took up its abode. The first matter that emerged from the consultation of these parties was the killing of kings. In short, both government and people were thrown into disorder. Later they observed that these affairs arose from the people’s lack of attention to religion, for verily trustworthiness, religiosity, virtue, character, and deeds spring from the fear of God. When this face is veiled, upheaval penetrates all affairs and assurance is transformed into perturbation. Therefore the kings of the earth generally perceived the cause and reason, and sought to hold fast to the cord of religion, although in truth some have been and are firm and steadfast in religion. Now it has reached the point where all have returned and repented. When any matter exceeds its proper bounds, its excellence remains concealed. At one time this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names–exalted be His glory: “Civilization and the like, should they pass beyond the limits of moderation, become the cause and source of universal loss.” Verily the servant beseeches God his Lord to guide them to His straight path, that religion may be wholly for God alone.</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the breezes of forgiveness have wafted over all creation and the waters of life have flowed among all religions! I beseech Thee by the rustling of Thy Divine Lote-Tree and the murmuring of the water of Thy mercy, whereby Thou didst quicken all who are in the heavens and on earth, to illumine the whole earth with the light of Thy knowledge and to attract them through the fragrances of Thy days. Verily Thou art He Whom the hosts of the world cannot hinder. Thou hast manifested in every age whatsoever Thou hast willed through Thy power and sovereignty. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones and chosen ones in prison through what the hands of Thy enemies have wrought–they who claim knowledge without any evidence from Thee. O Lord! Seize every ignorant one who hath been raised up in the name of knowledge, that Thy signs may appear in Thy dominion and the lights of Thy countenance in Thy lands. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And furthermore, O beloved of my heart! The breeze of your utterance hath passed by Me and hath wrought upon Me as the vernal breezes work upon the trees. By God! It hath gladdened Me to such an extent that I immediately took up the letter and turned towards the Most Exalted Goal, the Supreme Summit, until I attained His presence and laid it before Him. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which no one hath power to recount. By the life of my Beloved and your Beloved! The ocean of divine knowledge hath surged, and the light of utterance hath appeared in such wise as to illumine the earth and heaven. The servant found himself bewildered by the waves of the seas of utterance in the kingdom of proof. Though I cannot recount what I heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, yet I shall impart unto thee what the mirror of my heart hath retained from the Sun of Utterance. He said, exalted be His majesty and all-encompassing be His verses:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! He Who is the Lord of destiny remembers thee from His Most Great Horizon, and beareth witness unto thee as He bore witness before the creation of the heavens and earth that there is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people of the earth! Do ye desire to prevent God from exercising His sovereignty? Can a drop rise up against the ocean, or a mote contend with the sun? What aileth you, O company of oppressors? Fear God, and follow not your selfish desires. Follow Him Who hath guided you to His Most Exalted Path and called you to His luminous horizon.</p>
<p>Do ye imagine yourselves capable of extinguishing the Light? Do ye fancy yourselves able to quench the Fire of the Divine Lote-Tree? Nay, by My life! The ignorant divines have ever been and continue to be the cause of the people’s rejection. Yet God hath seized them with His might, for He is the Powerful, the Almighty. In this Most Great Revelation, God, exalted be His glory, hath not given, nor will He ever give, respite to the oppressors. Blessed is he who pondereth and is of the assured ones.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest toward My horizon! The very essence of being oppressed hath ever been and shall remain influential in the world. All the chosen ones and near ones are commanded to exercise patience, calm, love and kindness. God Himself standeth ready to requite the deeds of the oppressors and will not withhold the reward of them that are assured. Verily, He doth not suffer the recompense of the righteous to be lost.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! It behooveth thee to remove the garments of ignorance and heedlessness from the temples of My servants. Replace the ancient garments of ignorance with the robes of divine knowledge and wisdom, that the people may be sanctified from the conditions of self and passion and turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>O Taqi! Give thanks unto God for having opened before thy face the door of knowledge, illumined thee with the lights of utterance, and caused thee to speak His praise. Counsel the servants on My behalf to pure righteousness. Say: Rejoice, and be not grieved by what hath befallen My Name and My loved ones, upon them be My glory. The ignorant one hath kindled a fire through following his evil self, but God hath extinguished it through His power. Be thou assured and of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>One must enlighten people with utmost wisdom and utterance, and guide them to the city of knowledge. In the first encounter with the peoples of the earth, one should speak words from which the fragrance of love wafteth. If in that land some good lieth concealed, it will be made manifest through these waters of utterance, and if some light be hidden, the splendor of glory will appear from its countenance. In such case, the utterance of the exalted Word is permissible, and this too only after much emphasis and taking of covenant that the pearls of divine knowledge be kept hidden from the treacherous and thieves, and not be presented before every false pretender. If the loved ones exercise some discernment, they will distinguish the polytheist from the monotheist. These are they who see with the light of God - they are those of whom He saith: “They are given insight from God.”</p>
<p>The teachers of the Cause must meet certain conditions, as revealed in the Tablets both past and present. They must exert their utmost effort in preserving the Tablets of God. Time and again hath this most exalted Word shone forth from the horizon of utterance of the Lord of all being, yet until now no steadfast doer hath been observed. All who were seized in the past and since were found with the writings, save whom God willeth. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land - that is, those who possess a single countenance. Say: Beware lest the manifestations of power frighten you.</p>
<p>And furthermore, all were seized along with the Writings except whom God willed. Convey greetings from the True One to the friends in that land - that is, to those souls who are of one countenance. Say: Beware lest the manifestations of power and might frighten you, or the deeds of the ignorant sadden you. I swear by the Sun of the divine horizon of knowledge that that imprisonment and incarceration was the greatest profit for the friends and manifest loss for the heedless. Fear of what and anxiety from whom? Be sanctified and purified from hatred, malice, oppression and corruption, and with the utmost assurance remain settled and at rest in your place. The divine eye does not slumber and His power is not prevented by the might of pharaohs. By My life, the oppression of God’s chosen ones in that land is more beloved in God’s sight than a hundred thousand treasures, and its effects have appeared as you have seen and will appear. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and He is the All-Knowing, the Informed, and He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty. Soon these earthly temples who are occupied daily with cursing will be seen to perish, and the divine Cause will appear like the sun from the horizon of will. Verily He has power over all things. Look and remember when the Messenger came, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him the Interlocutor. Whenever a Prophet came, the divines first rejected Him, then those who followed them without any proof or Book from God, the Lord of the worlds. O thou who art mentioned before the Face and who standeth before the Gate! Be wakeful and vigilant in thy Lord’s Cause, then place resolve on thy right hand and prudence on thy left, and trust in God above thy head and wisdom before thy face. Thus doth He teach thee by Whose name the ocean of knowledge was set in motion. Rejoice in the utterance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose manifestation appeared that which was recorded in the Books, the Psalms, the Scrolls and the Tablets. Praise be unto Thee, O Cleaver of the dawn and Sender of the winds.</p>
<p>O My Beloved! For what purpose were ears created, and for what day are they beneficial? In the beginning of existence, the Tongue of Divine Power spoke the blessed word “Look and thou shalt behold Me,” and from the tongues of the realities of all things arose the cry “The Lord of Names hath come!” The attraction of the Manifestation hath seized all - some are aware, some heedless. Yet heedlessness endureth not. The effulgences of the Orb of consciousness shall, by the command of the Lord of the Manifestation, seize him and guide him to the straight path. Indeed, if there be in the essence of contingent being even a mustard seed’s weight of the power of recognition, it will surely be made manifest. This is the meaning of the blessed verse: “And if there be the weight of a mustard seed and it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, God will bring it forth.” They have risen to harm the friends and chosen ones of God, and without fault or error have wrought that which caused the Concourse on High to lament and weep. Yet they gained naught save the exaltation of God’s Cause. Nevertheless, they have not awakened and do not awaken. His Holiness Ismullah (may the Most Glorious of all Glory rest upon him) showed utmost love and kindness toward all the people of the world, and beseeched the Lord of all beings day and night to adorn mankind with the ornaments of trustworthiness, religion, chastity, and that which would benefit their souls. Yet there befell him that whose dust of sorrow reached the pure hem of the Lord of Destiny. And His Holiness ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar (may the Most Glorious Glory of God rest upon him) spoke with such perfect truthfulness that even the most impure could perceive its truth. Yet there befell him what befell him. Likewise the souls mentioned with them and other friends (may God’s Glory rest upon them all) were all seized without crime. The weight of these deeds rests upon the shoulders of the divines of the earth, for they are the primary cause. What hath been gained and what shall be gained from this seizing, reviling and harming? By the life of my Beloved and your Beloved, soon shall the sincere ones behold them in evident glory. These souls are the manifestations of the mercy, kindness and favor of God, exalted be His Glory. He hath preferred them and elevated them. Can anyone erase what hath been written by the Supreme Pen? Nay, by His Self, the One Who dominateth the seen and the unseen. At the beginning of the tribulation, this blessed word shone forth from the Tongue of the Lord of Oneness - exalted and glorified be His utterance: “O servant! The fire of sedition is ablaze, but the Hand of Power shall extinguish it.” This utterance hath repeatedly appeared in both Arabic and Persian from the Dawning-place of verses and the Day-spring of evidences. Blessed are they who attain! Those souls who are engaged in serving the prisoners and the captives are truly worthy of a hundred thousand favors. I beseech God, exalted be His Glory, to accept their service and to send down for them from the Kingdom of Utterance that which is adorned with the ornament of His presence. The handmaidens of God who have arisen to render this service are mentioned by the Supreme Pen with such praise that all the treasures of the earth cannot equal it. This servant beseecheth God to confirm all the friends in that land, both men and women, in serving these souls. Each of the friends of God who are scattered throughout the lands should assist these holy souls. The purpose of assistance is that they may share in the bounties and that the signs of unity may be manifested from them. Otherwise, verily He is the Helper of him who hath no helper and the Succourer of him who hath no succourer. He is powerful over what He willeth, and He is the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Indeed, concerning what you wrote about the lack of response to your esteemed letters, God is witness that this servant has been occupied day and night in the presence of His Countenance with the revelation of verses. Every fair-minded soul has been and is a witness to this and bears testimony thereto. Whenever opportunity arose, this servant has not been remiss in responding to the letters of the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory. In all matters patience, quietude, and forbearance have been observed, except in such special instances as your letters, which, when received, were presented at the Throne and answered point by point. However, during the recent upheaval, for a time the response to letters from the loved ones was delayed, and this too was in accordance with wisdom. Thus did the Lord of the world and the Desire of the nations command Me. Whatever reached the beloved Mahbubi, his honor the Name of Generosity, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, was given to this servant, and all attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and implore Him to assist this servant to serve His loved ones. His honor the Name of God, upon him be nine times [Baha] of Abha, has repeatedly mentioned that beloved one and has expressed great satisfaction. God willing, he shall be blessed with the good of this world and the next. If there has been or will be some delay, it matters not, for after this dryness comes the spring of mercy, and after these clouds comes the rain of bounty. Let him act according to that which he is commanded and make it manifest. Would that the people knew and understood! As to what you wrote regarding the Name of God’s instruction that you should send a petition to the Most Holy Court every month and number your future petitions - the servant bears witness that he spoke the truth and that from it wafted the fragrance of his love for His Presence. Take heed! What station could be greater than that the mention of that beloved one should repeatedly come before the Most Holy Court and attain unto the honor of being heard? But this word of that beloved one which you have mentioned is also pleasant and sweet, that even if I should send petitions throughout the duration of the kingdom of earth and heaven and receive no reply, I would not transgress the command of His Honor the imprisoned Name of God, for he is certain that whatever they have spoken is from the divine, unseen inspirations. After this word was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, the Kingdom of Utterance spoke this most exalted word. He says, exalted be His glory and universal His bounty: “O servant present! Verily the Truth has testified that he spoke the truth. Ask God to make him a leader of My servants through My Name and their guide through My wise remembrance. Give him the glad tidings of My word, My grace and My mercy, then attract him through My sweetest utterance that he may soar on the wings of longing in this atmosphere. And I am the All-Bountiful. O Muhammad-Taqi! The doors of grace have never been closed to your face, for verily it is open to those who enter, and His house is witnessed by those who circle round, and His Cause is known to those who hold fast, and His robe is wide and long for those who cling to it. You were mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One on a day when your letter was not present at the Throne and your call did not attain the honor of being heard. Our mercy and grace have preceded you, and We shall assist you through a command from Us, and verily I am the Helper, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>O son of him who hath circled round My Cause! This recent sedition hath not been, nor is it, of great moment. The fear of some hath been without cause. However, sedition is that which appeareth contrary to the good-pleasure of God. Soon shall the raven croak. The harm that hath ever been inflicted upon the Divine Lote-Tree hath come from heedless souls who have attributed themselves to the Truth and have committed that which hath caused the Cause to be wasted among the servants. Ask thou God, thy Lord, to protect His loved ones from the evil of these people. We pray for Our loved ones in Ta and its surroundings. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>This lowly one submitteth that God, exalted be His glory, hath answered all servants and handmaidens before their supplication, and His favor hath encompassed all before its manifestation. That same primal Word which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered encompasseth all: “This is a Book from the All-Merciful unto all who are in the lands,” and likewise His word, exalted be His glory: “O My loved ones in the lands.” This verse hath encompassed all. The steed of hope is galloping while despair with its hosts is put to flight. Thus hath the standard of hope been raised high and the banner of despair been lowered. Today there is no place or station for despair and despondency, for the rain of mercy hath ever been pouring and the seas of hope are surging. For years people possessed but a portion of the Qur’an, yet all held fast to it. Now some suppose there may exist several times as many books as the Qur’an. By the life of your Beloved and our Beloved! A bounty hath been manifested that hath had and hath no likeness or peer. A hundred thousand earths and horizons and heavens would be needed to recount but an atom of the effulgences of the Sun of His favor. Otherwise, whatsoever existeth is unworthy of this station. We beseech God to cause to appear from the hearts, in service to that Beloved One, that which is sanctified from despair and despondency and the like. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! We have previously made mention of thee in such wise as to cause eyes and visions to be gladdened, and We revealed for him who ascended that whereby the treasures of knowledge and inner meanings and the repositories of utterance were made manifest in all creation. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Knowing. By God’s life! We were with him when he ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, and the people of Paradise inhaled from him the fragrance of My raiment. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur bear witness from the most exalted station. We verily honored him and adorned him, and revealed for him that which the near ones shall remember throughout ages and centuries. O handmaiden of God! Rejoice in thy Lord’s favor, for there hath been sent down from the Kingdom of grace that which was the spirit of life unto temples and bodies. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He is with you and He is the Watchful, the Self-Subsisting. Hold fast unto goodly deeds and unto that which thou hast been commanded in the Book from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath held fast unto My commandments, and the servant who hath clung to the hem of My laws. We counsel every servant who hath turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, and every handmaiden who hath heard the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree, to hold fast unto that whereby the Cause of God hath been raised up amongst mankind. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon those who have heard and responded and held fast unto that which they were commanded in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the distress of that honored lady, God willing, His grace shall encompass her condition. The people of the earth, though some have usurped the rights of God and some have hoarded wealth, and the heedlessness of the rich hath reached such a state that they shun the poor, yet still they make accusations and every year busy themselves kindling the fire of oppression. These souls act with the utmost kindness and mercy, while those souls act with the utmost oppression, pride and dominion. However, that which hath no connection to God hath been and shall ever be transient and ephemeral. How many days have they partaken and do partake of this world? Where are their fathers and their great ones and their ministers of old who arose to oppose and disputed the signs of God, the Lord of all worlds? And where are their treasures and their riches, and where their influence and their power? Let them look into the graves; perchance they may repent and return unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. But their unworthy deeds have blocked the paths of awareness and awakening. They are afflicted by their own deeds until they return to their abode. The Command is in His grasp; He doeth and judgeth as He pleaseth, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And regarding the property, let them consult. If that assemblage be adorned with the friends of God, exalted be His glory, it is assuredly more luminous, excellent and radiant, and let them act according to whatsoever emerges from that assemblage. Thus hath He Who is our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth decreed.</p>
<p>As regards what you wrote concerning that leaf’s attention to serving that loved one and the honored Name, upon him be the Glory of God - this matter was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence - may my spirit be sacrificed for all in the kingdoms of command and creation. He expressed great favor, saying, glorified be His majesty: “Blessed is she and those who arise to serve My loved ones. They are indeed leaves of My most exalted Paradise. God will surely reward them with the most excellent reward. Thus has the matter been decreed from God, the Lord of Lords.”</p>
<p>Blessed are those souls who in the days of testing arose to serve to the extent possible. In truth, that service was for the Cause of God and for the love of God. The Truth, exalted be His glory, Himself gives glad tidings to His leaves and handmaidens of special rewards. Those handmaidens who have been mindful of the circumstances of the Name of God and those with him have ever been and are beneath the gaze of His favor.</p>
<p>O son of him who ascended to My Most Glorious Horizon! Some women in that land are observed to be two-faced. God has concealed and continues to conceal this. Pray that He may adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness and cause them to attain the exalted station. Say: God, then leave them to their vain imaginings.</p>
<p>The believing wife, upon them both be My glory and mercy, is mentioned before the Wronged One. She attained the presence when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra. We have mentioned her and do mention her as a grace from Us, and I am the All-Remembering, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Blessed are the leaves and handmaidens who today are occupied with serving the Cause and are moved to assist God’s loved ones. We have adorned their heads with crowns of utterance from the All-Merciful, and We shall soon send down for them that from which the sincere shall find the fragrance of My loving-kindness. And I am the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate.</p>
<p>As for mentioning the honored beloved, the son of ’Ayn-?a, upon them both be the Glory of God and His favor - praise be to God, from the first days he attained recognition of the Beloved of the worlds and has ever been and is mentioned in the Most Holy Presence. This lowly one presented at a special time in the Most Holy Presence whatever you mentioned regarding them and Haji Muhammad Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of our Lord’s gracious favor. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O ’Ayn-Qubl-?a! The servant present submitted your letter sent in his name to the Most Holy Presence and it attained the honor of being heard. Praise be to God, from the first days you have been adorned with the mention of the Truth, exalted be His glory. He loves whoever loves Him, remembers whoever remembers Him, and turns to whoever turns to Him, as a grace from Him. And He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of the Merciful One who migrated out of love for God until he arrived at the luminous Spot and heard the Call from the Dawning-Place of grandeur: “Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Generous.” Behold, then remember when thou wert standing before the Countenance and didst hear the call of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have made mention of thee in such wise that nothing on earth can equal it, as doth testify to this He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. And We make mention of thy brother who was with thee and attained unto that which was promised by the tongues of the Prophets and Messengers. And We make mention of your mother who attained unto the recognition of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. She is the one at whose mention My Most Exalted Pen is moved, as doth bear witness to this the Lord of Names in His exalted station. And We make mention of My handmaidens from whom the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned have slipped, as have those of every heedless ignorant one. And We make mention of the daughter of My Name, the Wronged One, who was named the Most Truthful in My Great Tablet. He cast the world behind him, turning unto the Lord of Eternity and Sovereign of nations, until he attained the presence of the Countenance and heard the call of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. O Leaf! We wish to behold thee steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the clamor of all who dwell on earth shall shake thee nor the signs of those who have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment shall veil thee. Verily thy brother hath attained to the service of the Cause. We have aided him and raised him up through a command from Us. Recognize thou his station. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. He arose to serve My Cause, spoke in My praise, traveled through the lands for My Name, soared in My atmosphere, and guided the people to My path, bearing hardships for My mighty, powerful Cause. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones! Give thanks unto your Lord, the Most Merciful, for this manifest bounty.</p>
<p>O My loved one and he who is mentioned before My Lord! From the wondrous and exalted verses, the favor of the True One, exalted be His glory, is evident and clear regarding them. May they, God willing, be assisted to act righteously and remain unperturbed by the vicissitudes of the days. And concerning what they wrote to His Holiness Ismu’llah Jamal, upon him be all the Most Glorious of Glory, that “through various means we attained deliverance from imprisonment” - after this gained the blessing of reaching the hearing of the True One, exalted be His glory, He said: “The intermediary they took walketh outside the path.” Then He said: “The brothers and souls from that household who are steadfast have all been and are under the protection and safeguarding of the True One, exalted be His glory.” When His Honor Haji, upon him be the Glory of God, intended to return, at the time of farewell he attained the presence, and after being dismissed, the word “protection” regarding him and his brothers was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names. This is a bounty that sufficeth him and His all-pervading Self over all in the heavens and earths. These matters of imprisonment and arrest had and have no importance, for praise be to God, the friends of God have been and are of pure breasts, illumined hearts and radiant faces, and such souls, by the life of the Beloved, are victorious. Blessed is the mother, for she hath arisen to serve the Cause and the friends of the True One. Every good deed manifested by them is mentioned before the Throne and adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Assuredly the True One, exalted be His glory, will exalt that household, for it hath been the dwelling place of His friends and chosen ones. I beseech and implore the True One, exalted be His glory, to protect that household from certain winds and wholly sanctify it from whatsoever is unseemly, that all souls dwelling in that house may be associated with the True One alone and be mentioned by His Name. These games of men - now arresting, now imprisoning - will all soon return to nothingness. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of proof that hath risen from the Most Great Prison that all they now possess and in which they take pride and glory is and was unworthy of mention. All is seen as perishable and non-existent. I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to adorn the people of that household, as He mentioned from the beginning unto the endless end, with this most exalted, most holy and most glorious ornament. Verily, He is powerful over all things. This servant conveyeth greetings and praise to each one - to the exalted matron, the mother, upon her be the Glory of God, and their honors the brothers, and the leaf, daughter of His Holiness Ismu’llah Al-Asdaq, upon him be all the Most Glorious of Glory, and likewise the handmaidens in that household who hold fast to the cord of the True One, exalted be His glory, and seeketh confirmation for each one. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of him named Tahmasb from the region of Dar al-Marz, that after two days of arrival in the land of Ta he ascended to the most exalted holy precincts - this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court. His blessed and exalted Word: “There hath befallen My loved ones there that which hath caused the Holy Spirit and the dwellers of the precincts of intimacy to lament. Blessed is every one who hath turned unto God and been touched by tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of Names, and woe unto every oppressor who hath oppressed and thereby earned for himself a grievous punishment. By the life of God! He hath lost in this world and in the next shall see himself among the most lost.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! Upon thee be My glory, My mercy and My loving-kindness! Behold and then call to mind when the idolaters in the land of M rose up against My loved ones and My chosen ones. They seized them, reviled them, beat them and plundered them. Say: O concourse of idolaters! Ye have committed that which hath caused the Supreme Horizon to darken and the denizens of the highest Paradise to lament. God hath lifted the Pen from children, yet through your tyranny there befell them that which caused the Temple of Justice to cry out from its exalted station. Ye have earned for yourselves that which shall never be touched by the fragrance of forgiveness throughout the duration of the names of your Lord, the Most Merciful. He Who speaketh from this station doth testify to this. Woe unto him who hath wronged the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, and unto those who followed them without clear proof or a Book from God, the Lord of the worlds. We make mention of each one of them even as We mentioned them before, and I am verily the All-Hearing Witness. We were with them when the oppressors advanced upon them, and We heard their cry, and We recount from Our Most Exalted Pen what befell them on this straight path. Say: O My loved ones in that land! Remember what the oppressors inflicted upon God’s Messengers and His chosen ones of old, and what befell Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him the Interlocutor. There hath befallen you what befell them. The Tongue of Grandeur doth testify to this, seated upon His mighty throne. Blessed are ye, and blessed is he who loveth you, and he who hath aided and will aid you, and he who remembereth your tribulations in this Announcement whereby the mountains were crushed and the pillars of every distant realm were shaken.</p>
<p>O son of him who turned to My most exalted horizon! The world hath become pregnant through this oppression, and soon shall its signs appear. The heedlessness of the servants hath reached such a state that were God to seize them all and spare but a few, those few would again rise up in sedition, except whom God willeth. How many wicked and oppressive souls who later rose up against God Himself with utmost tyranny and injustice, and the hand of divine wrath seized them all and returned them to the lowest of the low. Yet despite this, the rest of the people never became aware nor drank from the fountain of knowledge. The veils of glory have prevented their eyes from beholding the lights of beauty, and the cotton of heedlessness hath deprived their ears from hearing the Most Exalted Word. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who in R and Sh and the land of M were afflicted with great tribulations in the path of the Lord of Oneness. The denizens of the Kingdom of Names, the Concourse on High, and the highest Paradise send their prayers upon them, and behind them the Tongue of God, the King, the Just, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Kingdom that whenever any of them ascended, the exalted hosts, the cherubim, and the near-stationed angels all descended to receive his purified spirit and ascended with him. Verily the Truth with His tongue maketh mention of him who hath ascended and will make mention of him who will ascend, and mentioneth in this station His servant Nasir who ascended unto God in the prison of R and Sh. O Nasir! Hearken unto what the Wronged One mentioneth unto thee from the precincts of the prison, and congratulateth thee on the favors and bounties of God and what He hath ordained for thee in a clear Book. I testify that thou didst hear the Call and answer God, the Lord of Names, and didst make His love thy highest aim. I have made My ultimate goal thy love and good-pleasure, and to act in accordance with what He hath revealed in His mighty Book. By My life! If people knew thy station and beheld God’s bounty towards thee, they would sacrifice their souls and all they possess in thy path. To this testifieth every atom and, beyond them, He Who speaketh that there is none other God but Me, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Nasir! The denizens of the Kingdom stand astonished at thy steadfastness, thy firmness and thy constancy in this mighty Cause. There befell thee and thy noble person that which caused the Maidens of Heaven to swoon upon hearing it, and those who circle round the exalted Throne. Say: O oppressor! Thou hast committed what neither Pharaoh, nor Nimrod, nor he through whose tyranny the hearts of the dwellers of Paradise were melted and the hearts of them who are nigh unto God were consumed, had committed. Remember what befell Husayn and his companions at the hands of those who denied God’s right and His sovereignty, who disputed His signs and disbelieved in Him when He came from the Dawning-Place of utterance with a perspicuous command. By God! The Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, fruits and branches weep with the weeping of those who are bereft.</p>
<p>Ye have heard My voice which was raised in sorrow. Should ye hear My sweeter voice once again in mention and praise of you, We would give you glad-tidings of the greatest joy which hath come to you from God, the Goal of them who know. O My Most Exalted Pen! We have caused thee to hear what hath befallen My loved ones in the land of Mim, then Ra and Shin. Dost thou wish to hear the lamentation of the loved ones from another city? He saith: O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! My heart hath melted, my breast is aflame, my limbs tremble, and my being is convulsed by what I have heard from Thy most sweet tongue concerning what hath befallen Thy chosen ones. O Lord! The universe is nigh to swooning and returning to nothingness. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, the manifestations of Thy justice, the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity, and the effulgences of the sun of Thy bounty, to have mercy upon Thy servants. Thou art He before Whose utterance the waves of the ocean of utterance bow down, and before Whose manifestations of will the wills of the world prostrate themselves. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Pen! Be not disturbed by what thou hast heard. By My life! What I have mentioned to thee of the ocean of tribulation is but a drop, and of the oppression of the wicked but a letter. I have not recounted to thee what the Nightingale sang upon the prison branch in the land of Ra and Shin, nor what the Dove sang in the land of Alif and Ba. We behold thee, O My Pen, silent, speechless and bewildered, not knowing what the polytheists have wrought with the Book of God and its people. Were We to recount it to thee, thou wouldst, by the Lord of the worlds, be struck unconscious. We have veiled from thee what hath befallen those whom God hath made the letters of His Book and the signs of His Cause. Hold fast unto the cord of patience until God shall issue His decree and manifest what He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! We have received thy letter, and what thou didst compose and send hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant present before the face of thy Wronged and Exiled Lord hath chanted it. Blessed art thou, and blissful art thou and they who have attained unto imprisonment in the path of God, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, and the Lord of this exalted Station. Blessed art thou, O Land of Alif and Ba, in that God hath adorned thee with the lights of the countenances of His loved ones, through whose names the horizon of steadfastness was illumined and by whose mention all things have spoken. The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Great. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a command from Him in this station which hath been built in His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We have heard the lamentation of the people of earth and heaven, wherefore We stayed the Pen and chose silence, and I am the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! This letter was written six years ago and reached this point, and then due to the imprisonment of the friends in those days and the sorrows that befell them, the tongue remained silent and the pen stayed still until those days and nights ended, reaching this time when the moment for remembrance and utterance has come, for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne. In truth, thy letters arrived one after another and set in motion the cord of love and faithfulness. Therefore at this time, when one hour and nine minutes have passed from Thursday night, the 24th of the month of Sha’ban al-Mu’azzam 1306, I am present before the face of the Goal of the worlds, and thy detailed letter which arrived in these days was, after permission was granted, presented and attained the honor of being heard. His word, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O son of him who turned to My Kingdom and attained My grace and acceptance and soared in the atmosphere of My love! Hear My call on this night wherein sorrows have encompassed Me from all directions because of what the hands of the wolves have wrought in the land of Sad. By My life! The dwellers of My Kingdom and the people of My Dominion have lamented at their tyranny, and then those who circle round God’s throne, the Lord of the Frequented Fane and the Praised Station. Say: O people of the earth! Be fair in the Wronged One’s Cause and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who speaketh in every matter: “Verily, I am God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.” O thou who gazest upon the Face! By My life! My grief from the deeds of My loved ones exceeds what hath come upon Me from Mine enemies. My heart and My Pen bear witness unto thee - the Pen through which the Trump was blown and all in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Lord of the worlds and the Master of existence. The Day hath come, yet the people perceive not. The Call hath been raised between earth and heaven, yet they hear not. They have cast aside what God made as a healing for their ills and have taken what harmeth them. Verily they understand not. Blessed is the servant who hath forsaken all that is in the world, taking what was given from God, the King, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Loving. O Ibn Abhar! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of this Scene. There hath appeared in the Great City that which hath caused trustworthiness, religion, truthfulness and faithfulness to cry out. By God’s life! Justice lamenteth and equity weepeth, and the Wronged One saith: “Be fair, O people, and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come from the heaven of bounty with a clear proof.” My Most Exalted Pen moveth only toward that which elevateth the station of man in the contingent world, but the people have turned away from what behooveth them and have turned to every ignorant remote one. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou knowest and seest what hath befallen Thy Cause at the hands of them who have attributed themselves to Thee. They have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of justice and equity to lament in Thy days, hath disquieted the hearts of Thy loved ones and chosen ones, and hath caused grief to take hold of the inhabitants of Thy kingdom, Thy realm and Thy dominion. With their tongues they confess what hath been sent down from Thee, yet their deeds give them the lie. Then, as to those who have circled round the throne of Thy grandeur and held fast to the cord of Thy grace - O Lord, aid them to turn unto Thee and to acknowledge before Thine eyes what they have committed. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all worlds, to ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and purify them from the promptings of self and passion. Thou art, verily, the Lord of all created things, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Hear thou the voice of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. In the great city there occurred that which inflicted humiliation upon the glory of God and encompassed the Concourse of the near ones with profound sorrow. The Afnan, upon them be My glory and loving-kindness, desired to open an establishment for commerce in that city. Permission was granted, and this Wronged One’s purpose was that perchance the fragrances of trustworthiness, faith, truthfulness and sincerity might be diffused, and that the deeds and conduct of His loved ones might guide the manifestations of His names. However, self and passion prevailed, and the temple of tyranny drew the sword of cruelty against the temple of godliness. Treachery prevailed over trustworthiness, and falsehood over truth, bringing about that which causeth perpetual grief to endure. For the sword of oppression, through inequity, fell upon the head of justice, although no harm had come to that person from any quarter. The utmost consideration and love were shown to him, yet the fire of greed and covetousness so inflamed him that night and day he warred against his brother with arrows of rancor and spears of hatred, that perchance the commerce of that land might be confined to him alone. In short, he made peace with the enemy and assailed the friend, heedless that his affairs were manifest and evident in the presence of God. In his own estimation he interpreted the concealing grace and kindness of God, unmindful that this is the Day which hath been mentioned aforetime in these blessed words: “Lo! if it be but the weight of a grain of mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it forth. Verily God is Subtle, Informed!” We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to regard His servants with the glance of His loving-kindness and bounty, and to enable those who have turned away to turn unto Him, those who have denied to acknowledge, those who have associated partners with God to recognize His unity, and the oppressors to act with justice. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Bountiful, and He is the All-Generous, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Blessed is the sprinkling that has been shed upon the friends and loved ones from the ocean of divine favor. In truth, were the eye of fairness to be opened and the ears of justice attentive, one would hear all things proclaiming the glad-tidings of the Days of God. Today the very atoms of all created things give voice to His praise and glory, yet most of the people on earth remain heedless. The wonder is that until now they have failed to recognize the purpose of the Sovereign of being and the Lord of the seen and unseen, imagining that this most great Revelation would bring harm to the world and its peoples - even though the signs of God’s infinite mercy and the manifestations of the Sun of divine grace and favor have encompassed all. Through pure and goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct, His purpose stands clear and evident. This evanescent one beseeches the Eternal Truth to enable all to attain unto that which leads to their exaltation and glory, and to inspire in them whatsoever is His wish, that all may arise with complete assurance to accomplish that which is befitting, and that the entire earth, despite its diverse regions, lands and places, may be seen as one country, one land, one homeland and one realm. This is the greatest bounty and the purpose of the Ancient King. We hope His will shall encompass all and bring to light that which is now concealed. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Concerning what you wrote regarding matters that would bring comfort and cause prosperity, wealth and employment for the friends - these points were presented in detail before His Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. Here is what He says, exalted be His glory and mighty be His utterance:</p>
<p>O Ibn Abhar! In all matters one must consider their consequences. Every matter which today is conducive to the exaltation of the Word of God, the attraction of hearts, the magnetization of souls, the elevation of station, the uplifting of rank, and the benefit of existence - to this must one hold fast. The first command that hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning these stations is the ordinance of consultation. You and those few who are numbered and accounted before God as Hands of the Cause, as well as those assured souls who act and speak purely for the sake of God, must arrange an assembly wherein they shall consult together. Whatsoever the opinions of these souls shall settle upon, to that must they hold fast, placing their reliance in God. Assuredly in this way they shall be inspired with that which is the cause and source of success and prosperity. Verily God will accomplish His purpose. God hath ordained a measure for all things. Convey My greetings to the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One, and remind them of that which hath been revealed. We beseech God to make all aware of the station of this Most Great Cause, the excellence of these days, their recompense and reward, and the manifestations of their signs and fruits throughout centuries and ages. For were they to become aware, they would arise with heart and soul to serve in every aspect and station. That which hath been revealed in every aspect and station is beyond the power of all to reckon. However, if the people of Baha, who in the Books and Tablets have been designated as the party of God, should resolve to reform the world and its peoples, they shall assuredly be aided and confirmed. Verily God is the Strong, the Dominant, the Powerful. No matter can frustrate Him, no force can weaken Him, no rejection of the rejecters nor oppression of the oppressors can prevent Him, and nothing escapes His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid one of His loved ones to compile all that hath flowed from the Supreme Pen in various stations concerning the absence of conflict, contention and corruption, as well as counsels, consummate wisdom, and the unity and concord of the servants. Verily He is the Helper, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Great. Likewise the mention of those souls who in this Most Great Revelation, with perfect attraction and enthusiasm, with longing and yearning, have sought the station of sacrifice and have offered up their lives in the path of the love of the Beloved of the worlds - these matters are acceptable and praiseworthy before God.</p>
<p>If through the favors of the Desired One of the worlds unity and concord be realized, the doors of glory, mercy, comfort and wealth shall be opened before the faces of all. This evanescent servant, and that beloved one, and the other loved ones must beseech God, exalted be His glory, to enable all to attain unto this most exalted station and this supreme rank.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding the two souls and their arising in love, fellowship and service - after being submitted before the Most Holy Court, these exalted words were revealed from the Tongue of Grandeur, exalted be His utterance: “We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid them and those who have desired to do good in this most mighty, most luminous and most glorious path, in accordance with what He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for them what He hath ordained for those who circumambulated around the Will in the beginning and the end.” Their intention, even before their deed, hath been honored with the mention of the Wronged One. Blessed be they both! In all circumstances, one must hold fast to that which was previously mentioned. Verily He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing, the Helper, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Aqa Muhammad Husayn and his wife, upon them be the glory of God, praise be to God that they have attained to the mention of the Goal of all the worlds. The effulgent rays of the Orb of grace have ever shone resplendently upon His loved ones without cessation or delay. The pen can never adequately describe this station, nor can the tongue make mention of it. The servant beseeches his Lord to aid all to draw nigh unto His loved ones and to serve His chosen ones. Verily He is the Answerer of prayers and the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p>You made mention of the Kitab-i-Iqan and its publication and distribution. This is a momentous matter, a great bounty, and a perfect good. I beseech and implore God that He may aid all to do what is befitting in this day. After these matters were presented before the Divine Throne, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these exalted words, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! We beseech God to adorn thy head with the crown of detachment, thy heart with the ornament of patience and forbearance, thy temple with the pearls of wisdom and utterance, and to cause to flow from thy tongue that which will attract the servants to the Creator of all existence. Say: O people of God! The power of piety and contentment is mightier and more penetrating than the hosts of earth and heaven. Blessed is he who hath laid hold on these and attained unto them. Piety is the lord of deeds and virtues, and hath power to transform the servants. It is a blessed captain with a vast domain and a wondrous command. Its hosts too are blessed and propitious - they are goodly deeds and radiant attributes.</p>
<p>You made mention of the Books - who can reckon them? If people were granted but a drop from the ocean of fairness and attained unto a single Tablet, all would turn, detached from all on earth, to the horizon of the heaven of the Manifestation. Thus hath spoken the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O My beloved! The fire of tyranny, injustice, ignorance and unwisdom melteth man’s being. By the life of God, our Lord and your Lord! In the nights and days, verses have descended from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all beings like rain - nay, even more copiously. In truth, all are powerless and incapable of gathering and preserving them. They have been so widely dispersed that none but God, exalted be His glory, can hope to gather them all together, save whom God aideth through a power from Him and a strength from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding Mashhadi Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, and his arising to serve the Cause, his assistance, and his conduct in accordance with God’s good-pleasure, exalted be His glory - after these were presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused the realities of all things to be attracted. Exalted be His utterance and sublime His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Generous</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down from the All-Knowing to him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Wise, that he may drink from the words of the All-Merciful the wine of understanding and may thank Him with his outer and inner tongue. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Muhammad-’Ali! The path of guidance is as clear and evident as the sun, and the Divine Lote-Tree standeth adorned with delicate, ripe fruits before the faces of the world. Blessed is the servant who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having remembered thee from the prison and revealed for thee that which hath cooled the eyes of understanding in all creation. Blessed be the All-Merciful, the Manifestation of whatsoever He willeth through His all-pervading grace. When thou hast attained unto the fruits of knowledge from the All-Merciful, say:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I testify that Thou art my Creator, my Fashioner, my Sustainer and my Helper. Thou didst raise me up among the dead and adorn me with the ornament of life. Thou didst give me to drink from the Kawthar of divine knowledge and didst strengthen me to stand firm amidst all creation. Thou didst adorn me with the pearls of resignation, reliance, and devoted attachment. I know not, O my God, by which of Thy bounties I should remember Thee, thank Thee, and praise Thee. Through Thy great mercy Thou didst awaken me when I was asleep, cause me to speak when I was silent, draw me near when I was far, and bestow Thy favors upon me when I was hesitant. O my God, I am surrounded by the bounties of remembrance, nearness, care and kindness. I beseech Thee, O Transformer of all things and He Who is established upon the throne of manifestation, by Thy power before which the might of the world hath bowed down, and by Thy strength which hath encompassed all nations, to make me hold fast unto Thee and be detached from all else save Thee. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee to make me among those who move only by the winds of Thy Will and Purpose. O Lord! Thou seest the stranger seeking the most exalted homeland, and the lover drawing nigh unto the station of nearness and meeting. Ordain for him that which will make him renowned among Thy servants and distinguished by that which befitteth Thy Manifestation, Thy sovereignty and Thy days. O Lord! Forgive me and those with me, then accept from me what I have done in Thy love and Thy path. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Bountiful. O Lord! Thou seest Thy handmaiden turning toward Thy most exalted horizon, hoping from the ocean of Thy bounty that which will cause her to hold fast unto Thee and Thy verses. O Lord! Aid her to remember and praise Thee among the handmaidens that she may draw them unto the court of nearness, holiness and eternity. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all servants and the Speaker on the Day of Reckoning.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Mashhadi Agha as a favor from our Lord, the King of the Kingdom of Names. Glorified be His station, His majesty and His utterance.</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Agha! Today the world is illumined by the lights of the countenance of the Ancient King, and the Sun of utterance is shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of the Mother Book. The ocean of knowledge is surging and the heaven of wisdom is upraised. Is there any possessor of sight who will behold, any possessor of knowledge who will understand, any possessor of ears who will hear that which the Lord of Destiny uttereth from His Most Great Prospect? Is there any just one who will show justice regarding this Most Great Cause and this Mighty News whereby the heart of every wise one was troubled, the foot of every learned one slipped, and the face of every denier was darkened? Nay, by My true Self, save him who cast away vain desire, seeking the path of guidance. He is of the people of Baha in the crimson scroll. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this exalted station. Thank thy Lord for having mentioned thee in such wise that thy mention shall endure throughout the eternity of His mighty and wondrous kingdom.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of him who is named Rahim, that he may drink the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and be of those who are firmly established. Today steadfastness, after the recognition of God, is the most excellent of all deeds. O Rahim! Hold thou fast unto it and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations, for having mentioned me in Thy Most Great Prison when I was in the hands of the heedless. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Thou hast been mentioned by one who hath quaffed the sealed wine from My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and who hath been seized by the intoxication of the Kawthar of My utterance, to such extent that the reins of choice were taken from him, causing him to soar in the atmosphere of My loving-kindness, to hold fast unto the cord of My love, and to be immersed in the ocean of My mercy. We make mention of thee through My grace, for I am the All-Bountiful. Hearken unto the Call from the Supreme Horizon; verily it draweth thee unto Him and bringeth thee nigh unto a station which God hath made the circumambulation point of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Highest Heaven. Verily, He is the One Who doeth what He willeth, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>When thou hearest the Call, say with utmost lowliness and supplication: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and glorification be unto Thee, O my Heart’s Desire, and splendor be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose manifestation the mountains were moved and the earth was shaken!” Blessed art thou for having inhaled the fragrance of the breeze of God as it wafted with grace, and for having turned toward the Horizon of Revelation on a Day wherein most men were prevented from turning unto Him.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy wife who hath shattered the back of vain imaginings through the name of her Lord, the Master of the Beginning and the End, and We give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all ages. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden, for having turned unto God when most people were in doubt and error.</p>
<p>And We make mention of thy sister whom God hath assisted to celebrate His praise and commemoration, and caused her to speak that which hath stirred the hearts of the valiant. O My leaf! Hear My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, He will assist thee in that which will draw thee nigh unto Him, despite every learned one who hath forbidden and every woman who hath forbidden. Verily thy Lord taketh whom He willeth through His command; He is severe in punishment.</p>
<p>Say: “My God, my God! Unto Thee be glory and splendor, and unto Thee be bounty and generosity. I beseech Thee by the oceans of Thy grace and the stars of the heaven of Thy bounty and generosity to forgive me and my sister, through Thy loving-kindness which hath preceded all created things and through Thy favors which have encompassed all beings. Enable us to remember Thee and to praise Thee in all conditions.”</p>
<p>Splendor be from Us upon thee, O Ibrahim, and upon those with thee, and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath prevented from God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, and who have uttered the praise of their Lord at eventide and at dawn, at night and at day’s end.</p>
<p>The splendors of the Sun of Grace and the effulgences of the Luminary of Mercy have encompassed the world. What else can this evanescent servant say? Every letter of the letters and every word of the words, with utmost eloquence and power of expression, invites the servants to the most exalted Paradise and bestows the water of life upon the people of contingent being. Will the earth bring forth that which hath been deposited therein? In truth, this matter appeareth difficult, except through the assistance of the Hands of His power. His hands are outstretched, and in His grasp are the keys of the heavens and earth and every wise command.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Ustad Ibrahim, upon him be the glory of God. He is the All-Wise Expositor.</p>
<p>O people of God! The divine Tree of Love is adorned and manifest with the fruits of wisdom, utterance, knowledge and understanding. By the life of God! It standeth before all faces, yet the unjust people are heedless, nay, rather, disbelievers. Today the Hand of God bestoweth the Kawthar of eternity. O ye that thirst, hasten! O ye that are heedless, become aware! O Ibrahim! The great bounty is manifest and the Beauty of the All-Knowing is evident. Say: O people of the world! The Most Great Name hath rent asunder the veils and with the hand of power hath removed that which barred the way, and like unto the sun is visible and manifest. Deprive not yourselves and forbid not yourselves from the Countenance of the All-Merciful because of the sayings of this one or that. Soon shall perish that which hath occupied you and prevented you from attaining unto and drawing nigh unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy sister who hath drunk the choice wine of certitude and hath attained unto the recognition of God in His glorious and wondrous Day. O My leaf! He who hath loved Me hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee. Say: My God, my God! Assist Thy leaves to accomplish that which Thou hast ordained for them, that they may be stirred by the winds of Thy Will and the breezes of Thy Purpose. O Lord! Thou seest a handmaiden among Thy handmaidens who hath attained unto Thy days and desireth from the ocean of Thy bounty the pearls of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the Hands of Thy Cause and the effulgences of the lights of the Luminary of Thy justice to make me steadfast in Thy love. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, son of Muhammad-Hashim Mishki-baf, upon them be the glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer and the Speaker.</p>
<p>Give thanks unto thy Lord for having aided thee to turn unto Him, for having shown thee His path, for having guided thee through His grace, and for having illumined thy heart with the light of His knowledge, and brought thee out of darkness into light. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Kind, the Forgiving. O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! We counsel thee with that whereby thy station shall be exalted among the servants, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of men have slipped save whom God hath willed, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy mother and upon My steadfast handmaidens who have adorned themselves with the ornament of chastity and fidelity and have acted according to what was commanded in the Book of God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The tongue of justice declareth: Is there anyone in the world who can reckon the waves of the ocean of the bounty of our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven? Nay, by His own Self, the True One! We are all powerless.</p>
<p>And concerning what ye mentioned about Ustad ’Ali-Muhammad, son of Ustad Mahdi-Banna, upon them be the glory of God, after being presented before the Throne of the Lord, exalted be His glory, these manifest verses were revealed from the Kingdom of grace. His word, exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name that is sanctified above all names</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Lord of all desires, Who hath made the hearts of His loved ones repositories of the pearls of His love, such that the pharaohs of the world and the tyrants of the nations are powerless and incapable to possess or transform them. The heavenly sustenance hath ever been and shall be the food of enkindled souls. They drink from the Kawthar of utterance and are nourished by the bounty of recognition. O ’Ali-Qabli-Muhammad! Thy name hath attained the honor of My hearing and thy heart the light of My knowledge. We beseech God, exalted be He, to give thee to drink from the cup of His grace, the Salsabil of His bounty. Verily, He is the Generous Giver. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of thy son who was named ’Abdu’r-Rahim and give him the glad-tidings of his Lord’s mercy which hath preceded existence in both the unseen and visible worlds. O ’Abdu’r-Rahim! Be steadfast in the love of thy Lord, speaking His praise with wisdom and utterance, clinging unto Him, placing thy trust in Him, and committing all thy affairs unto Him. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of thy brother Qasim who hath ascended unto God. God hath forgiven him through His mercy and grace. We beseech Him to cause him to enter Paradise. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Responding One. Blessed is he! We testify that he hath attained the mention of My Most Exalted Pen in My Great Prison.</p>
<p>This is what hath been revealed for the son of Jinab-i-Dhabih, upon them both be the glory of God, His mercy and His loving-kindness. He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O youth! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Some time ago thy letter attained the Most Holy Court and an answer was revealed, but its dispatch was delayed. If God should will and desire, it shall be sent this time. Thou hast ever been and art remembered. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee, make thee successful, and honor thee with beholding His signs. Verily, He is the Helper, the All-Wise. Make mention of the kinsmen on behalf of the Wronged One and remind them of the verses of God. Verily, He is the Hearing, the All-Seeing. God hath forgiven the one for whom thou didst seek forgiveness, Muhammad-Rida. Verily, He befriendeth whosoever befriendeth Him and answereth those who call upon Him.</p>
<p>The Tablet for that honored one was revealed during the presence of the beloved of hearts, His Holiness ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. This servant beseeches his Lord to honor thee with it and grant thee the bounty of meeting him. Verily our Lord is the Generous, the Bountiful. The mention of that spiritual beloved hath ever been in the heart. The Forgiving Lord knoweth and He is the Witness.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of the handmaiden of God, Sarih Khatun, who is related to Jinab-i-Qurratu’l-’Ayn Aqa Mirza Mustafa, upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God. After being presented before the Most Exalted Horizon, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these blessed words, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>O My leaf! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. The calamities of this world, however severe and great they may be, shall pass away and come to an end. However, the calamities that cause endless tribulations are those of turning away from the Truth, which transform the realm of joy into sorrow and melt the soul. Praise be to God that that leaf hath clung to patience and held fast to the hem of forbearance. Beautiful patience is among the great divine favors. Pray for the handmaidens of God. We beseech from the Truth that He make all of them dawning-places of sanctification and daysprings of purification, and cause them to be the means of deliverance and success for the people of the earth. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>We hope that through the grace of the Desired One of the worlds, the handmaidens of that land and other regions who are associated with the Truth and have attained unto the blessed word “O My handmaiden” may become sources of goodness among women. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful, and He is the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>
<p>The mention was made of Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim and Aqa Mirza Abdul-Wahhab, upon them be the glory of God. After being informed, He turned toward the Most Exalted Station and was honored to hear these words - exalted be His utterance and glorified His praise:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor</p>
<p>O Ibrahim! Verily the Friend calleth unto his Glorious Lord from the fire, and the Beloved, amidst His enemies, speaketh saying: “O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Thou seest the Wronged One in the hands of the enemies of Thy Cause, and beholdest what hath befallen Him in Thy path. There hath descended upon Him that which hath descended on no one before. The wolf hath seized His flock, the oppressor hath sunk His ark, and the serpent hath opened its mouth and swallowed one of His loved ones. I beseech Thee, by Thy Name through which Thou hast illumined the world, to assist Thy loved ones to stand firm in Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest Thy servant who is named Ibrahim turning to the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. Illumine him with the lights of Thy knowledge, then grant him the food of Thy heaven, then ordain for him and his wife that which will draw them near unto Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Aqa Muhammad Husayn, son of the wronged one who hath been raised up:</p>
<p>He is the One Who ruleth over all names</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Verily, He calleth thee from the horizon of the heaven of grace with that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to make every one who hath turned unto Him a herald of His Name, one who uttereth His praise amongst His servants, one who is illumined by His attributes amongst His creation, and one who acteth in accordance with that which will attract the servants unto Him. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. Say: O people of the earth! Behold and then judge with fairness that which hath appeared in truth from One mighty and powerful. By God! The door of the treasury hath been opened by the hand of power, and the pearls of knowledge and wisdom have appeared from One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which will elevate your stations in the earth. He, verily, is the Counselor, the All-Informed. We have borne hardships and tribulations that ye might draw nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken while in His Most Great Prison. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, by His generosity which hath encompassed existence and by His bounty which hath encompassed the world, to forgive everyone who hath turned unto Him with evident submission. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee. Convey My greetings unto their faces and remind them of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty, and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>The mention was made of Baba Khan, upon him be the glory of the All-Merciful, who is named Fath-’Ali Khan. On this day, which is one of the days of the revered month of Sha’ban, two hours before sunset, having turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and the Supreme Summit, it was presented before His presence and was honored to be heard, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed especially for him from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will, that the verses might attract him to a station wherein nothing whatsoever shall prevent him from drawing nigh unto Him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken, exalted be His proof and glorified His sovereignty:</p>
<p>In His Name, Who calleth from the Divine Lote-Tree and Who was manifested upon the Mount</p>
<p>Verily We desired to send unto thee from the Most Great Ocean pearls of wisdom and utterance, and from the palm tree of knowledge fresh and tender proofs, and from the Sidrat al-Muntaha a fruit from among its fruits, that these may draw thee unto the station of sanctity and nearness and immortality, and assist thee in serving the Cause in such wise that nothing among all things, no name among all names, and no mention among all mentions shall prevent thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. The call of the Tree hath been raised amidst all religions, and the murmur of the Kawthar of utterance hath been heard throughout all creation, and the warbling of the nightingales of knowledge upon the highest branches. Blessed is the soul that hath turned towards it, and the eye that hath beheld the signs of the Most Exalted Pen of God, and woe unto every heedless doubter. We have heard thy call, and thy name hath been present before the Wronged One. We have revealed for thee that which no mention can equal. Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair in this Cause and follow not the manifestations of fancy and idle imagination. Then turn thy face unto the people of the Furqan and say: Come ye, come ye! By God, the All-Merciful hath come with power and sovereignty. Cast away what ye possess and take what ye are commanded by God, the Lord of creation. The tales of old profit you not this Day. Purify your ears that ye may hear the call of God from the most exalted station. Say: O people of the Spirit! Fear ye God and refute not the truth by what ye possess. He Who was mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen and promised in the Books, Scriptures and Tablets hath come. Shatter the idols by the name of your Lord, the Lord of mankind. This is the Day whereon secrets have been unveiled, fruits have appeared, and the earth hath told its tidings before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Say: O people of the Torah! Open your eyes. The Revealer of verses hath come, through Whom the ocean hath surged, the fragrance hath wafted, and the Tongue hath spoken in the kingdom of utterance. The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords. By God! Neither the whisperings of your divines nor the Judaism of your leaders shall profit you. Cast away what ye possess and take what is with God, the Lord of the Final Return. Say: Fear ye God. He hath come with a light that hath outshone the sun and its splendor, and with a Cause before which all who are in the heavens and on earth shall not stand. If ye deny this Revelation and what hath appeared from Him, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Be fair, and be not of them who have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to what they possess of vain imaginings. This is He Who hath stood before the faces of the world and revealed what He desired. He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The might of the Pharaohs of the earth deterred Him not, nor did the hosts and factions frighten Him. He concealed not Himself for less than a moment. He revealed that which made the limbs of them that disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, to quake. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee in serving the Cause and to draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. When the breezes of revelation stir thee and the Kawthar of utterance taketh thee from the hand of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and made known to me Thy Most Great Path, and for having given me to drink the choice wine of Thy utterance from the hand of Thy bounty. O my Lord! I was asleep; Thy most sweet call awakened me. I was heedless; the dawning splendors of the morn of Thy Revelation aroused me. I was far; the hands of Thy grace and bounty drew me nigh. I beseech Thee by the Word through which the sincere hastened to the place of sacrifice and the unitarians to the Most Sublime Horizon, to make me steadfast, firm and upright in Thy love and Thy Cause. Thou art verily the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>All praise and bounty belong unto Him, and unto Him all generosity, mercy and bestowal. Through a hundred thousand proofs and evidences is His grace established, and none to this day has been able to reckon His endless showers of mercy, all confessing their powerlessness and limitation. When even these rains, which through the favor of the All-Powerful descend from the clouds, cannot be counted, how then can one enumerate the rains of mercy that descend at all times from the clouds of divine knowledge and wisdom? The way to enumeration is barred, and the path to limitation is closed. This evanescent servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to assist His Excellency the Khan in that which shall cause his mention to endure among all mentions. The Command is in His hands; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>You mentioned Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God. The hope of this evanescent one is that those loved ones who in this time have attained unto the Kawthar of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds and have drunk the wine of recognition from the hand of bounty, may hold fast with supreme steadfastness in such wise that all who dwell on earth shall find themselves powerless to prevent them, and that they may arise like unto kindled fire and the sun shining from the horizon of God’s will, turning their attention to the reformation and purification of the world and its peoples. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth; he is indeed of the people of this noble station.</p>
<p>After mention was made of the name of His Honor Asad and his desire for the forgiveness of the tailor who ascended in the prison, following the presentation of these matters before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, these most great verses were revealed from the heaven of supreme bounty. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh the Truth</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! Today the ocean of divine unity hath appeared before the face of the Lord and His servants, and each wave thereof with eloquent tongue uttereth the blessed words “God hath come with manifest sovereignty.” The people of the land pride themselves over the people of the sea through the light of attainment, and in utmost joy and delight are occupied with the remembrance and praise of meeting their heart’s desire, the Desired One of all worlds. From the homes of the hearts of those brought nigh and the sincere ones arise melodies and songs of the lovers in the paradise of the Beloved. The orator of the city of love hath been seized with mighty rapture and ecstasy until God, exalted be His glory, shall ordain what He willeth and manifest what He desireth. Say: My God, my God! I testify that this Day is Thy Day and this Cause is Thy Cause. Thou seest me, O Ravisher of the hearts of those brought nigh, O Ecstasy of the hearts of the yearning ones! I beseech Thee by Thy manifest light and Thy mighty, firm Command to make me of those who have been seized by the rapture of the call from the supreme horizon. O Lord! I am he who hath sought Thy station and presence before Thy face and standing at Thy door. I beseech Thee by the spirits that have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and by the souls that have shed their blood in Thy days, to assist me and those who have believed in Thee and Thy signs in that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy servants. O Lord! Thou seest how the wolf hath seized Thy sheep and how the grunting of swine hath been raised in Thy lands. I beseech Thee to conquer Thy cities through the hosts of utterance. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of your father and mother, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to forgive them both, and then him for whom thou didst seek forgiveness, through His mercy that hath preceded all created things and His grace that hath encompassed all contingent beings. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. O my Lord! Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy bounty. Ordain for them that which will draw them nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>The purpose hath been achieved and the prayer answered. God hath forgiven you and those who emigrated with you. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. He doth not suffer the reward of the righteous to be lost. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of them that know Him.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention concerning Aqa Muhammad-Hashim, son of Haji Mulla Muhammad-Amin, after learning of his circumstances, We approached the presence of the Lord of Creation and presented his case, which was honored to be heard. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-before-Hashim! Reflect upon the cause of rejection, opposition, rancor, hatred, tyranny, wickedness, and loss of the former people. For if one becomes aware of its reason and cause, he will not slip from the straight path nor remain heedless of the momentous News. In brief, certain tales and titles deprived those souls from the Supreme Horizon and afflicted them with grievous misfortune. I speak the truth when I say that this is a great Day and His grace is infinite. Whosoever desires to enter the depths of the sea of oneness must purify his heart from the stories of old and exalted titles. The word “successorship” adorned the realm of fancy and built the cities of vain imaginings. O people of God! Know ye the value of this Day. Reflect upon the ignorance of the Shi’ih. When the Qa’im appeared in truth and unveiled the mysteries for the triumph of truth - He Who had been the object of devotion of hearts and minds throughout ages and centuries - the divines of that sect gave Him no chance to speak or show the way. With the sword of malice, the spear of hatred, and the arrow of cruelty, they removed from their midst that Manifestation of Divine Power and that Dawning-Place of His decree and destiny, through an oppression at which the Pen is ashamed to recount and the Tablet is powerless to bear.</p>
<p>Now consider the Sunnis, when someone in Sudan claimed to be the Mahdi, most people in various lands accepted him and arose to serve him with such vigor that caused the limbs of armies to tremble. By the life of God! Had they received what was revealed in the Seven Proofs from the Tablets sent down to that people, all would have turned to God and would have been engaged in circumambulating the dawning-places of divine verses and the repositories of heavenly knowledge. Now observe in what station the Cause stood and in what station the Shi’ih. They prided themselves before the world with the name of successorship, while that very pride and vainglory became a barrier between truth and falsehood and deprived them of drawing nigh unto God. We hope that henceforth they will not remain deprived of the truth because of such mentions, nor be bereft of the shore of the divine ocean of knowledge. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, and He is the Munificent in both beginning and end.</p>
<p>We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee in His remembrance, to aid thee in remaining steadfast in His love, to cause thee to hear His verses and to show thee the signs of His Pen. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.</p>
<p>His honor the Perfumer - upon him be the Glory of the Self-Subsisting - hath in these days repeatedly been mentioned in the presence of Him Who is the Lord of all mention. In truth, from the beginning of days until now, he hath been occupied with that for which every existing thing was honored with the garment of being for this most exalted station. Blessed be he!</p>
<p>The statements regarding the guidance of faithful and devoted souls, and likewise the mention of their purposes and aspirations before the Most Holy Court and seeking permission for these matters were presented before the Throne, and this response has appeared from the horizon of the will of the Lord of Creation. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Make mention of the people of God in that land on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Blessed are ye for having attained to the grace of these days and for being illumined by the light of recognition. The preservation of this lofty station and noble rank is essential, for the highway robbers have been and are lying in wait. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve you from the evil of His enemies and from those who have denied the Day of Judgment. By the life of God! Those who have drunk from the cup of utterance have ever been and shall ever be mentioned.</p>
<p>And regarding their seeking permission for attendance: in these days events have occurred that have caused the greatest sorrow and supreme anxiety. Were this Wronged One to mention what hath befallen Him, the tribes of the earth would be seized with trembling. Therefore, if the souls mentioned would share the expenses of the journey and deliver half thereof to Ali Haydar, in view of the absence of Amin, this Wronged One will reveal and send forth from the Most Exalted Pen mention of their turning and devotion and presence before the Face. The command is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. And afterward that which His will hath determined shall be commanded to the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>As to their desire that the friends, both living and deceased, be mentioned in the divine presence that they might attain His grace and be adorned with the ornament of forgiveness - this supplication hath been mentioned before the Mentioned One, and these exalted words have been revealed in response from the heaven of mercy. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Ibn-i-Abhar! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Verily We have heard thy call and thy mention and thy praise and thy request and what thou didst desire for the sake of God, thy Lord. We have answered thee that thou mayest give thanks to Him Who aided thee in turning to Him and in making mention of Him. He is the Helper, the All-Knowing. Well is it with what thou hast done in mentioning those who desired from the sea of thy Lord’s bounty the pearls of pardon and forgiveness. He hath forgiven them as a grace from His presence. By My life! When mention of them was made before the Face, the Sun of God’s loving-kindness shone forth. Verily the ocean of bounty surged and the fragrance of faithfulness wafted and the lights of His mercy which have preceded existence in both the unseen and visible worlds encompassed them.</p>
<p>O Asadullah! Rejoice in that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in such wise that the rains of grace and bounty have been showered upon thee and upon those who have ascended to the Supreme Companion, as a favor from God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Upon thee be the glory of God and His mercy and loving-kindness, and the glory of the Supreme Concourse, and the glory of those who have sacrificed their spirits and bodies and all they possessed in the path of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And We make mention from this Most Great Scene of him who was named Ja’far, who believed in God and held fast to His firm cord. O Ja’far! Verily the heaven desired thee and the sun turned toward thee and the light shone before thy face by virtue of the Ancient Face having turned toward thee from this manifest horizon. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having made thee in this time to associate with the Prophets and Messengers in a Paradise whose boundaries are not fixed, whose fruits never fall, and whose leaves are never still, moved by the breezes of will and purpose from the presence of One powerful and mighty.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn! Thy name hath been mentioned in the Most Great Vision, and the Lord of the world hath remembered thee with such remembrance as hath enraptured the hearts of those who desired to attain the presence of their Lord, the Mighty, the Great. We beseech God to send down upon thee, at all times, the rain of mercy and forgiveness. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>As to the honored Karbila’i Mahdi, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, that which was revealed concerning him two days ago is the cause of eternal grace and everlasting bounty. His Holiness Ismu’llah M.H., upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, mentioned him and he attained unto the remembrance of the Goal of all the worlds. Joy be unto him!</p>
<p>Likewise concerning the departed and elevated Hajiyyih, upon her be the glory of God, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed about that virtuous lady. God willing, that beloved one will attain unto it. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>And mention was made of the kinsmen. Praise be to God, both before and after, that which was revealed concerning them is such as crieth out in the Books. Blessed are they that hear and joy be to them that are turned unto Him. And this matter attained unto the hearing of the Lord of Names in the Most Exalted Horizon. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>“The suns of loving-kindness and favor have shone forth upon the kinsmen with such brilliance that all the pens of the world and tongues of nations are powerless to describe and praise it. We testify that they have drunk the choice wine of understanding from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and have attained unto that which none among the people have attained, save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, hath willed. Upon them be My glory and the glory of all who dwell in My Kingdom and My Dominion, and the glory of this Most Exalted Station, and the glory of the cities of justice and fairness at every morn and eventide.”</p>
<p>Unto Him be thanksgiving and glory and might and praise. Each of the mentioned names hath received their portion and share from the Luminary of the utterance of the Goal of all the worlds. Joy be unto every servant and maidservant who hath attained! And likewise those souls who have ascended and passed on have all attained unto the waves of the ocean of forgiveness of the All-Merciful Lord. This servant hath ever said and continueth to say that the time of death in these days is blessed, for one attaineth unto the pearls of the mention and praise of the Lord of all beings. Were they to become aware of the influences of these remembrances, all would seek and supplicate for this station.</p>
<p>And regarding thy mention of the friends of the earth, upon them be the glory of God, after being presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these manifest verses were revealed specially for all. God willing, they will attain unto them. His blessed Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Speaking, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O My friends in affliction! Hear ye the Voice of Him Who hath been cast into prison. He calleth the loved ones unto the Lord of Lords–they who have quaffed the wine of divine knowledge from the chalice of My bounty, despite every denier who hath rejected God in the end. O My friends! Hear ye My call which draweth you nigh unto the most exalted Paradise–that station wherein all things proclaim: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of all men!” Ye have attained unto My remembrance, both before and after, at whose revelation all verses have bowed down in humility. Blessed is the servant whom neither books have hindered from the Mother Book, nor scriptures and psalms from the Mother Tablet. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, whereupon the limbs of every obstinate infidel shall tremble. Can any remembrance compare with His remembrance, or any verses with His verses, or any revelation with His revelation? By God! When He appeared, Sinai cried out in most eloquent utterance: “O people of creation! The Summoner hath come with power, and He Who revealeth with might and sovereignty.” Cast aside the books of those who have turned away from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: O people of Iran! Fear ye the All-Merciful. Verily, the Proof hath appeared in human temple and proclaimeth before the faces of all religions. Hearken and hasten to God’s mercy and pardon, and follow not the sources of idle fancies and vain imaginings. The earth hath revealed its treasures, the heaven its suns, the sea its waves, and the light its radiance. Fear ye God and be not of them who have denied the Proof and Evidence. Say: By God! That which ye possess shall profit you not, nor shall your riches suffice you, nor shall your fancies save you. Cast aside what ye possess and take what ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of the Throne and of all ranks. There hath descended from the heaven of bounty the table of divine knowledge, and from the cloud of grace that blessing which God hath sanctified from decline […] God’s treasury of the pearls of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath seen, and woe unto every idolater who hath denied God when He came from the heaven of bounty with the standards of verses. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those whom the veils of the people of error have not withheld from the Dayspring of Revelation.</p>
<p>O people of God and His servants! Most people cling to vain imaginings, especially the people of Iran who have been nurtured on suspicions and fancies. The Book of God is manifest before all faces, and the Sun of Truth shineth from the midmost heaven, and the light of the Cause is radiant and resplendent, yet all remain heedless and veiled save those who have held fast to this mighty cord. O people of God! Hear ye the voice of the Wronged One, and purify your hearing and sight from the tales of old and that which is with the people, that ye may perchance attain unto the divine traces and hearken unto His Word. How many are those who read, yet are unacceptable before God! For if one were truly to hearken, he would find himself established upon the throne of steadfastness. The deniers of the Word and the clamorous ones have been and are lying in wait, and this is news which the Most Exalted Pen hath announced from Prison. Blessed is the servant who hath cast vain imaginings behind him, turning unto God, the One, the All-Informed. The world shall be seized by change and extinction. Take ye that which shall endure through the endurance of the Kingdom and the Realm. He, verily, is the All-Counselling, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We make mention of the handmaidens of that land and counsel them to be steadfast, chaste, and engaged in remembrance and praise. O handmaidens of God in that place! Blessed are ye, for ye have attained unto that which the divines of Iran failed to attain. They deemed themselves most profitable, yet were found to be most lost; they counted themselves most exalted, yet were observed to be most abased. Today even the Jews take pride over such souls, for those faithless people martyred the Desired One of the world. The deniers of the Bayan are seen to be more lost than those people, as doth testify unto this the Mother of Tablets in this exalted station. The mother and sister - upon them be My glory and loving-kindness - have been and are mentioned in the Most Exalted Paradise. The glory shining from the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O people of Ra, and upon those whom the hosts of names prevented not from turning to the Most Great Ocean, each drop whereof proclaims: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat.</p>
<p>We hope that the people of God in that land will spend all their time in matters that cause the exaltation of the Cause. Under all conditions hold fast unto wisdom and utterance, and engage in the salvation of souls for the sake of God. Soon shall the world and all that is therein pass away. Blessed is the soul that attaineth unto that which changeth not and which shall never perish. Verily our Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful, and He is the Kind, the Merciful. This servant’s request is that ye convey greetings to the loved ones of the land of Ta. Each one hath been and is mentioned in the Holy Presence. I beseech God to unite the loved ones and illumine them with the light of harmony, for this is the greatest means for the order of the world. For all I beg such success as will increase their piety, steadfastness, purity and detachment. He is verily the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Regarding the reprinting of the Book, the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken these exalted words: We previously made it contingent upon consultation, but in these days the printing of the Book is not permitted in that city, for mischief-makers are present who would immediately report it and exaggerate in their declarations, and this would cause an uproar among the ignorant. Until now they know not what this Wronged One’s purpose is, nor what His intention may be. They speak based on conjecture and soar with the wings of idle fancy. Leave them in their vain imaginings. Some time ago, permission was given to ?abibu’llah, but the intention was for a limited number. A detailed explanation of this matter was mentioned to ’Ali-Akbar. God willing, they shall also attain unto its reading and become aware of the intention. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to honor the people of the world through His might, to make them know His path and His Cause, and to aid them to recognize what He hath willed. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Today let not that Beloved One and the other loved ones be saddened by what hath appeared and continueth to appear from the heedless ones. By the life of our Beloved and the Beloved of all who are in the heavens and earth, the Cause of God shall soon be made manifest through His command, and the horizons shall be illumined by the light of His justice. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Although hearts are grieved by the deeds perpetrated in the great city, yet at one time this exalted word shone forth from the Dayspring of utterance, the Goal of all the worlds - His word, exalted be His glory: “O servant present! Now, as these are the days of Revelation, forgiveness and mercy and grace prevail and are manifest before all faces. When the Sun of Justice dawneth, its appearance will cause the deeds of all to be tempered with moderation, for it is the cause of the manifestation of unity and concord. Therefore one must not be saddened by the conditions and occurrences of these days.</p>
<p>In the days when the people of God were imprisoned in the land of ?a, how many souls arose to render service and from every direction showed forth love and affection! The men from one side and the women from another were engaged in nursing and service with complete love. God Himself is witness, and these services of those days have not been and will not be forgotten, and in the Crimson Book the name of each one hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. The reward of no one hath been or will be lost. We beseech God to adorn those souls with such an ornament that the world of deeds may be illumined and brightened thereby.”</p>
<p>These letters that were sent also testify to the service of all and to the mercy and favor of God, exalted be His glory, and to the acceptance of deeds. Blessed are they who serve and who bear in the days of God, the Lord of earth and heaven. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon every one who hath turned unto God, and every assured one, and every steadfast one, and every detached one, and every upright one who hath arisen to serve the Cause of God and hath detached himself from all else.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Intended One Who, through His sacred will, has bestowed perfect fellowship between the hearts and souls of all people, and from this fellowship complete unity is achieved, and this unity is the most mighty door for the tranquility of nations, and through this unity gathering is made manifest, and gathering is the cause and reason for the rectification of all affairs through consultation, whose decree has been sent down with utmost clarity in the [Divine] Book. Blessed is he who has attained unto that which God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, has desired.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Upon thee be My peace! The loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, have ever been and are those who “speak not until He hath spoken, and who do His bidding.” In the books of the past and future mention hath been made of these men. They are the dawning-places of divine attributes and the manifestations of heavenly characteristics. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect thee and to give thee to drink, in all conditions, from the hands of His bounty, the choice wine of His utterance. By My life! It will attract thee to a station wherein thou shalt behold in all creation naught save the effulgences of the light of His Noble Name.</p>
<p>This Wronged One hath ever mentioned and will continue to mention the loved ones, especially in these days when His Honor M. and H., upon him be God’s remembrance and peace and praise, hath made mention of the friends of that land and hath requested for each one of them Tablets from which the fragrances of bounty are wafted. We beseech God to assist him and thee in that which He desireth. Verily He is the Lord of creation and the Ruler in the beginning and in the end. Convey My greetings to the loved ones. We beseech God [to assist them] in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to open before their faces the doors of grace and bounty with the key of His Most Exalted Name. Peace be upon thee and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>Praise, glory, thanksgiving and splendor befit the Absolute Sovereign Who attracted weak creation through the light of utterance and adorned it with the ornament of supreme power. Through one blessed word He caused the new creation to blaze like a sphere of fire and sent it forth with a mission. He is the Powerful One Whom the might of the world did not prevent and the power and dominion of nations did not hold back from His purpose. Glorified be His majesty and universal be His bounty!</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned! Hear the call of the Wronged One. Verily He guideth thee to the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and teacheth thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him. He is, verily, the One with power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and was read by one of My Branches who was named the Light in the Book of Names. We have answered thee with this Tablet as a grace from Our presence and a favor from Our side, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Possessor of the Promised Day. When thou attainest unto My Tablet and findest the fragrance of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of Thy knowledge, guided me to Thy path, attracted me through Thy verses, and caused me to attain unto Thy days and to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Dayspring of Thy clear proofs. I beseech Thee by the Crimson Scroll and by what was revealed therein of Thy greatest signs, and by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which Thou didst break the seal of Thy Choice Wine, that Thou make me among those whom the oppression of the oppressors hath not prevented from drawing nigh unto Thee, nor the clamor of the heedless from turning to the door of Thy grace. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have desired from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. O Lord! Disappoint me not from the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bestowal. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Exalted be His Glory! The Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>O Friends of God, one and all! If a friend claims friendship with his tongue but commits an act that causes harm to the Beloved, what befits such a soul? Can the word “friend” be applied to him, or can he be mentioned by the name of “beloved” in the presence of the Beloved? No, by the Lord of the Great Throne! The true friend is one who becomes so intoxicated with the sweet wine of the love of the Friend that he desires naught but His good-pleasure - that is, he should have no wish, desire or thought of his own, but should see all things as consumed in the good-pleasure of the Friend. He moves not except by His leave, and desires naught save that wherein lies His good-pleasure. I swear by the Sun of Unity that has dawned from the Horizon of Divine Oneness that the turning of the loved ones to this direction causes harm to the very root of the Tree. Therefore my tongue bears witness that whosoever turns to this direction after what has been inscribed in this Tablet is not of Me, and God is sufficient as Witness.</p>
<p>O friends! How long will you remain heedless? Reflect at last! Consider the end of all matters at their beginning. It is known and evident that We have had and continue to have the utmost love for each one, and if We saw it advisable We would surely have summoned you Ourselves. Hearken unto this loving counsel: Move not without His good-pleasure and be not assured by any soul. Guard your tongue. Be not deceived by two words of seeming affection, and count not such ones among the faithful. The matter of this station is most severe - deem it not light. We beseech God to aid you to do what is right and proper, and to make you among those who choose what God has chosen for them. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>

<p>O Husayn, upon whom be the Glory of God! In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most High! This is a remembrance from God unto His servant who was touched with adversity in the path of his Lord and ascended unto God at a time when he was wronged at the hands of the oppressors, and who believed in God his Creator and recognized His Cause in days wherein all faces were turned away from the court of sublime glory and most of the servants denied God Who created and fashioned them - thus was the matter irrevocably decreed. O servant! How excellent it is for thee that thou didst fulfill thy covenant, and if there occurred to thy heart that which was not befitting God thy Lord, He hath verily forgiven thee in truth and purified thee at the time of thy ascension from the defilement of all the idolaters. The angels drawn nigh welcomed thee from the highest paradise until they reached thee between earth and heaven, and thou didst witness with thine own eyes the grace of God - thus did the mercy of sublime glory encompass thee. Would that thy people knew how thy Lord forgave thee and made thee among the honored ones in Tablets of resplendent glory, and how thy name flowed from the Ancient Pen and thy remembrance was recorded in a Tablet preserved from the eyes of all the worlds. We were with thee at the time when the clouds of death enveloped thee, and We took thee with the hand of mercy and caused thee to ascend to a station which We had ordained for thee before Adam was created from a handful of subtle clay. Therefore, walk thou through the levels of paradise and partake of the fruits of the holy Lote-Trees as thou pleasest, by the command of One Who is mighty and bountiful. And associate with the maidens in chambers of moist crimson ruby, then mention unto them what hath befallen this Wronged One in this Prison which was concealed from the eyes of the loved ones. And glory be upon thee, O servant who hath ascended unto God, and upon those whom God hath related unto thee, and verily He was their Guardian, then their Protector, then their Helper.</p>

<p>God makes mention of His servant that he may rejoice within himself, and this is indeed a mighty favor. Seek thou the grace of thy Lord at all times, for His mercy hath preceded all created things and His grace hath drawn nigh unto thee. Detach thyself from all else save Him. Those who summon men unto Satan, these are in darkness and grievous unbelief. Leave them to themselves, then turn with thy whole being unto God, in Whose grasp lies the kingdom of all things, and He will suffice thee against all who dwell on earth. He desires whomsoever hath desired Him, and loves whomsoever hath loved Him, and draws nigh unto those who have drawn nigh unto Him, and He is indeed merciful to His servants. Cast behind thee the customs of men and take hold of the ordinances of God through a power from Us, then shun every doubting opposer. Say: Fear ye God and hesitate not in this Cause whereof ye have been given glad tidings in a beauteous Tablet. Drink thou a draught from the living waters from the cup of thy Lord’s love, the Mighty, the Bestower. Then return to thy dwelling place and remind the people of this Cause at which all who are on earth have been dismayed, save those upon whom the breezes of thy Lord’s mercy have wafted, and who have been turned from the left hand of idle fancy to the right hand of certitude by a word from Him, and He is indeed the Observer of all things. Say: O My loved ones! Stand ye firm in the Cause and follow not every contemptible liar. Await ye the grace from the direction of God, your Lord, and His grace doth indeed encompass you. Blessed is he who hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings and delivered the Abraham of faith from the hosts of wicked unbelief. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen teach thee on this darksome night, that thine eyes may be solaced thereby and thou mayest stand firm in the Cause whereby the feet of every denying transgressor have slipped.

O servant! Remember what befell Us in the lands of exile through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought, and God is witness unto this. By God the Truth! Such afflictions have touched Us as none can reckon save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds. Twenty years have passed over Us, and none knoweth how they passed save God Who created all things by His command, and He, verily, is wise over all things. Yet We were patient in that which was decreed for Us - and patience is from none but Him, and He, verily, doth recompense the patient and the grateful. We give thanks for that which hath befallen Us, and We praise Him morning and evening. We have placed Our trust in Him in all matters, and We desire naught save what He desireth, and We will naught save what He willeth, through God’s might and His power. He is the best Helper and the best Supporter. And thou, O servant, walk thou in My footsteps and be content with what God hath ordained for thee.

And if harm touch thee, be patient; and if good touch thee, be grateful.

<p>The Most Great, Most Holy, Most Ancient. A remembrance from Us to him who has turned to the Ultimate Goal and attained the Supreme Horizon on a day wherein the Herald called out from every direction: “The Prison belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great,” that the magnet of remembrance and utterance might draw him to a station wherein he seeth naught save God and His Will, the All-Subduing, dominant over the worlds. This is the most exalted station, yet most of the people are heedless. O Muhammad! Blessed art thou for having attained, visited, beheld and heard that which the Dawning-Place of verses hath spoken from His noble presence. Glorify thy Lord with praise at all times and be thou of them that remember. Praise be to God that through the grace of the All-Merciful thou hast attained unto the water of life, entered the Most Great Scene and been illumined by the lights of the countenance of the Lord of Destiny. His is the praise in all conditions. The most meritorious of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, hath been and shall ever be the teaching of His Cause, albeit with wisdom as hath been revealed in the Tablets. By My life! It is the lamp of deeds and their garment and their crown. Whoso attaineth unto it hath attained unto all good from the presence of a Self-Sufficient, All-Praised One. God willing, your honor must engage in this matter with perfect wisdom. Although, in accordance with your request, permission was granted for you to direct yourself once again to the Prison, yet if you were to transform this traversing of a long distance into teaching the divine Word, it would be more excellent and more beloved, for praise be to God, you have attained His presence and drunk from the wine of reunion. This is what the All-Merciful hath testified. Know thou its worth and be of the thankful. Whatever Tablets you had requested have been revealed and sent, and later too, should there be need and should they desire it, God willing and should He desire it, they shall be sent. We beseech God to assist you through His sovereignty and to ordain for you what He loveth and what pleaseth Him. And upon thee be glory.</p>

<p>This is a mention from Us to him whose letter was present before the Countenance, that this remembrance may draw him nigh unto a station wherein he shall behold naught save the revelation of God and His signs. Thus did the Pen speak when the Wronged One was walking in His Most Great Prison. This is a day wherein the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary hath spoken in the highest Paradise - the Tree which was planted by the hand of might and bounty - proclaiming: “The King hath come! The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the Day of Judgment!” Blessed is he who hath heard the Call, and blessed the one with vision who hath beheld the Most Exalted Horizon. But woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Thy letter was present and the Most Great Branch presented it before My Most Luminous Presence. We answer thee with this clear remembrance. Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to acknowledge that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath uttered, and to confess that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which the seal of the Choice Wine was broken, to ordain for me by Thy Most Exalted Pen that which Thou didst ordain for Thy loved ones who violated not Thy Covenant and Testament, who concealed not Thy Cause, and who spoke with wisdom among Thy servants - the wisdom which Thou didst send down in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Word, whereby Thou didst open the gates of hope unto all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, to ordain for me that which shall profit me. Thou knowest what I have and what is in my heart, while I know not what is with Thee. Thou art verily the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>A remembrance from the All-Merciful to His servant, that He might draw him to the Dayspring of the Cause with a countenance illumined by the lights of the Throne. We make mention of thee in the prison, that thou mayest make mention of thy Lord in thy days, that perchance they that slumber may rise from their graves and find a way unto Him Who is the Lord of Grace. Say: O people! The All-Merciful hath come in the shadows of light, while the evil ones flee to the right and to the left. Say: There is no protection this Day save for him who hath laid hold on the cord of his Lord, the Chosen One. Thus hath the matter been decreed. And he who believed and then denied, in every age hath he been in doubt concerning the Cause. Say: O people! Doth He Who calleth you amidst the floods of tribulation desire aught for Himself? Nay, by His Lord, the All-Merciful! He desireth from you neither recompense nor thanks. He calleth you for the sake of God, and whoso hesitateth, he is indeed far removed from the precincts of nearness. Say: O people! Dispute not in the days of God. Sanctify your seats from the mention of those who have disbelieved. And he who layeth hold on the remembrance of the All-Merciful, he is indeed independent of the mention of all else. The heavenly table hath been sent down; abandon ye the carrion behind you. Drink ye from the Most Great Ocean, then forsake the brackish water. Arise to aid the Cause with wisdom and utterance on this Day wherein eyes are fixed in wonder while the idolaters are thunderstruck by this Light that hath shone forth upon the horizons. Thus hath the matter been ordained in the Tablet. Say: Had the idolaters heard the verses of God and found the sweetness of what they contain from the Kawthar of utterance, they would have cast away what they possess and would have turned unto a station known by the name of God. Thus have We sent down unto thee clear verses that thine eyes may be solaced thereby and that thou mayest remind the people of this Dawn which hath been witnessed from the horizon of God. And glory be upon thee and upon him who hath turned unto the Countenance. By God! He hath indeed been mentioned before the Truth as among the most exalted of creation.</p>

Say: We have lit the lamp of prosperity from before the One Who causeth the dawn to break. Verily it is the Most Great Sign for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Every rock hath been stirred by the breezes of Revelation, yet most of the people are as dead. Blessed is he who hath been born again through the breathings of the Lord of Names and hath found the fragrance of the verses from the garment of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O concourse of ardent lovers! The ocean of attainment hath surged, and this is that meeting with which the eyes of the Messengers of God have been solaced. Verily He is the Dawning-Place of the All-Merciful amidst all possibilities and the Source of Revelation unto all the worlds. Say: O company of the learned! Why have ye turned away from the Dayspring of divine knowledge after having been promised it in the Tablets of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed? By My life! They are worshippers of vain imaginings, save him who hath held fast to My Name, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath come with a mighty sovereignty. Say: O concourse of merchants! The Chosen One hath come with grandeur and power. By what proof have ye turned away from the Intended One? Hath this world prevented you from the Lord of Names, and have ye been withheld by following every heedless sinner? Cast away what ye possess and take what ye have been commanded by One mighty and powerful. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen command you from before the Creator of heaven, if ye be of them that know. The world and all that is therein shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Mighty, the Wise. O thou who hast turned towards Us! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having been mentioned before the Throne, and for this mighty Tablet having been sent down unto thee. When thou attainest unto it, impart what is therein unto them who have believed in God and are firmly rooted. Verily, glory be upon thee and upon them who have turned with their hearts unto the Beloved. They are indeed among the triumphant ones.</p>

O Lord! Have mercy on all who have circled round the Kaaba of Thy presence and cast aside their vain imaginings, turning toward the horizon of certitude through Thy bounty and favor. O Lord! This is Thy servant whom Thou hast named Jamshid in the kingdom of Thy names, and Thou knowest that he turned toward the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Source of Thine inspiration on a day whereon the souls of Thy servants were perturbed and the faces of Thy creatures were changed, save those who were illumined by the lights of Thy countenance and turned toward the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. O Lord! Ordain for him the best of what lieth with Thee in Thy Kingdom and Thy dominion, then open before his face the doors of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And Thou knowest, O my God, that he hath migrated unto Thee and tasted the sweetness of tribulations in Thy path. I therefore beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst send down the heavenly table to the sincere ones among Thy creatures, to make him in all conditions take refuge in Thy presence, seek protection in Thy court, hold fast to the cord of Thy favors and cling to the hem of Thy generosity.

When We entered the Most Great Prison, We summoned the kings of the world and all peoples to God, the Single, the All-Informed. Among the people were those who found the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and turned to Him, and among them were those who turned away, following every dubious learned one who cast the verses of God behind their backs and clung to the suppositions and idle fancies they possessed. By God! What they possess will not profit them - to this testify all things, and beyond them this truthful, speaking, trustworthy Tongue. Hearken to the call of the Wronged One and trust in God in all matters. He loves those who have turned to Him with radiant faces and clung to the hem of My All-Bountiful Name.</p>
<p>God willing, may you be successful through divine grace and remain steadfast in His Cause. The beginning of the matter is the recognition of God, and its end is steadfastness in His Cause, for the demons have been and are lying in wait. Be on your guard against them. Thus does He Who possesses the Mother Book teach you. Be not grieved by any matter. The grace of God has been and will be with you. Soon there shall be revealed to you what lies hidden in an inscribed Book. Divine joy and heavenly victory have been and will be made manifest. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing. Though for some days affairs may be observed contrary to what is pleasing, be not saddened. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings that ere long whatsoever hath flowed from the Divine Pen shall become manifest and evident. Be assured and be among those who render thanks.

Verily, My remembrance of him is better for him than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earths. God shall soon raise up this remembrance upon a countenance that, were all things to behold it, they would exclaim: “Blessed be God, the Most Excellent of Creators!” And verily, He shall be with thee in thy solitude, and in the hour when thou enterest a place wherein there is neither lamp, nor bed, nor helper, nor assistant. And He shall be with thee and shall not part from thee in thy exile and thy solitude. And when thou enterest the seat of thy Lord’s throne on a mighty day, then shall He walk before thee, and all created things shall be illumined by the lights of His countenance. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having migrated in My path and kept company with My noble one who hath traversed the way out of love for God, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful, and who hath passed through the lands out of love for God his Lord, and hath conveyed unto the people this mighty and wondrous remembrance. And in the hour when thou didst walk with him, the denizens of the all-highest Paradise and the Concourse on high did magnify thee.

And the glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and upon those who have turned with radiant countenance toward the Luminary of Paradise.

But the people of the Bayan recognized Him not, save a few among them who are of Our near servants.

Though I bear witness, O my God, that they who have left their homes, hastening toward the seat of Thy glory and gazing toward the horizon of Thy grace, are ever dwelling within the precincts of Thy mercy and drinking from the wine whose seal hath been broken by the hands of Thy power, yet I beseech Thee, O Thou the Beloved of Baha, to ordain for her the reward of those who have outwardly entered the pavilion of Thy grandeur, heard the melodies of Thy transcendent unity, and drunk from Thy hand the Kawthar of Thy mercy. O my God! Thou knowest the yearning of the lovers in their separation and remoteness from Thee, and the sighs of them that long for Thee when prevented from turning to the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to accept their deeds and to send down upon them that which will gladden their hearts at the descent of Thy decree and cause them to be content with what Thou hast ordained for them in Thy Tablets. Then send down upon her, O my God, from the wonders of Thy mercy that which will comfort her heart, tranquilize her being, and give rest to her body. Verily, Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>This is a Book which the Most Merciful hath sent down to all who dwell within the realm of possibility, summoning all to a station wherein the Light hath shone forth and where He Who conversed on Sinai hath been established upon the throne of Revelation, and the Tree hath proclaimed: There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: This is the Promised Day, did ye but know it, and this is the Day whereof God’s Books of old have given tidings, and this is the Preserved Tablet. Say: O concourse of earth! Deny not the signs of God after their revelation, and reject not Him Who hath come unto you from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Cast away your vain imaginings, then turn with your hearts toward the horizon of God, the Sovereign of existence. Say: O servants! By God, the Day of Reckoning hath come, and the Lord of Creation hath spoken forth from the Most Great Prison, calling all to the Frequented Fane. The heedless have caused Us to dwell in the most desolate of houses, yet God hath designated it as His Frequented Fane, to their utter shame - if they but understood. Had they known what they had wrought, they would have wept both night and day, at eventide and at morn. Thus have We lit the lamp of proof within the niche of utterance. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless one who remaineth veiled. O thou servant who hast turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He hath heard thy call and hath answered thee through this Hidden Tablet which was treasured in God’s knowledge from time immemorial. To this testifieth he who hath perceived the fragrance of the All-Merciful when He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>The servant who was present came before Us and presented what was in thy letter. Thereupon the ocean of thy Lord’s loving-kindness surged, and He revealed for thee that which shall bring solace to all eyes. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him. He shall assist thee in every world among the worlds of thy Lord. To this testifieth He Who proclaimeth in every matter that there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. When the fragrance of Revelation was wafted abroad and the breezes of God wafted forth at the dawn of His Promised Day, the people rose up in opposition, save those whom God willed - thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Among them were those who followed the divines of the age who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, and pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused those in the unseen realm and in the visible world to cry out. Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee that which nothing on earth can equal. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Most Kind, the All-Forgiving. Say:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name all things were attracted and through Whose love the hearts of them that dwell in the kingdom of names were consumed! I beseech Thee by the tears of them that are nigh unto Thee in their separation from Thee, and by the sighs of the sincere ones in Thy days, and by the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace, to make me detached from all else save Thee, holding fast unto the cord of Thy loving providence, steadfast in Thy remembrance and in the service of Thy Cause in such wise that the hosts of denial shall not prevent me from turning unto Thee and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy generosity. O Lord! I am he who hath turned toward Thy horizon and set his face unto the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thy Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. O Lord! Kindle me with the fire of Thy love in such wise that all the seas of the earth shall not quench it. Then make me so steadfast that neither the ascendancy of the nations nor the hosts of the world shall deter me. Thou art He through Whose Name the Resurrection came to pass and the Hour was made manifest. Nothing whatsoever can frustrate Thee, nor can the clamor of the enemies prevent Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest by Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou pleasest through Thy power and might. Thou knowest and seest my turning unto Thee, my humility, my submissiveness, my poverty, my need, my powerlessness and my lowliness, and Thou hearest my sighing, my crying, my appeal and my lamentation. I beseech Thee by the power of Thy Most Exalted Pen and its crackling in the kingdom of creation to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and profit me in the world to come and in this one, through Thy bounty and mercy. Thou knowest what I possess and I know not what Thou possessest. Verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Furthermore I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen, to make me in all conditions hold fast unto Thy Will, content with Thy good-pleasure, and speaking Thy praise. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom they that are in the heavens and on earth cannot weaken. Thou art, in truth, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>From the Burning Bush beyond the Radiant City upon the hallowed Spot of God’s Command, the Mystery of God hath, by the power of the spirit, been witnessed, and speaketh in truth saying: “O people of the Bayan! Have ye disbelieved in the One through Whom ye believed in God aforetime? Here is My Beauty, which hath been revealed through His grace; yet have ye allowed them that are the manifestations of names in the kingdom of creation to shut you out therefrom; notwithstanding that they were all created by His Word. He, verily, is powerful over all things.” O Most Great Name! We, verily, have made thee to be among the greatest of names, that thou mayest issue forth from the abode of silence, and rise above the dawning-place of utterance to proclaim a Cause that hath encompassed all worlds. Unloose therefore thy tongue in truth, and announce unto the people that whereof, by the power of the Spirit, He hath informed thee in this Tablet, which was sent down from the right hand of the throne. Beware lest aught deter thee from commemorating thy Lord. Burn away the veils of sorrows through the Name of thy Lord, the God of Mercy; then shine forth above the horizon of remembrance with a perspicuous light. Beware lest thou forget the occasion when thou didst enter into the Beatific Spot, and didst come before the throne; when We cheered thee with tidings of all good, and ordained for thee on earth an exalted station. Break not the Covenant thou didst enter into before God, neither violate His Testament, but be steadfastly loyal to thine undertaking. Be constant in thy love for thy Lord: beware lest thou withhold thyself from that which We have destined for thee, that thou mayest be reckoned in the Mother Tablet among such as are well grounded in their belief. Write then in vindication of this Cause whatsoever the Spirit infuseth into thy breast; He, verily, will inspire thee with the truth, and assist thee in a matter whose outcome hath been predetermined by the Pen of God. Spirit, Honour and Glory be upon thee, and upon those who are with thee at the dawning of the Cause; at the eventide of holiness; and at every moment.

<p>In the name of the one true God! Thou didst journey and emigrate until thou didst attain to a station that hath been recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in all the divine Books. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve that which He hath bestowed. Convey My greetings to the friends of God, glorified be His majesty, and command them on behalf of the Wronged One to the Most Great Steadfastness, that all may attain to that which is acceptable and beloved in the sight of God. The dust of irreligion hath seized the world and the clouds of idle fancies have obscured the Sun of Justice. Say: O friends! Hold fast unto God and fix your gaze upon Him. Today steadfastness is accounted as the greatest of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficing, the Most High. Hold fast unto it and be free and detached from all else but God. This is truly the Day of Divine Unity - deprive not yourselves thereof. Reflect upon the people of a former religion: after lamentation, weeping and expectation, they martyred the Lord of all beings, yet to this day they remain unaware of what they have wrought. Heedlessness and pride have so seized those souls that their condition surpasseth description by pen and ink. We beseech God to guide all and deprive them not of the splendors of the Sun of Truth. Convey greetings to all the people of the villages and say: “The mention of each one hath flowed from the tongue of the Wronged One and been recorded by the Supreme Pen.” Strive that ye may attain unto that from which the fragrance of eternity can be inhaled. We likewise make mention of the steadfast handmaidens and counsel them to celebrate the praise and glory of God and that which He hath revealed in His Perspicuous Book. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have turned with illumined hearts and upon those women who have turned unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>

Blessed is the soul that turned to you and visited your dust and remembered your days and what befell you from the enemies of the Self of God, your Lord.

The hearing ears have heard the cry of the rock, yet most people remain veiled and rejoice in what they have done. But after this joy shall come a sorrow and a tribulation that shall endure as long as God’s kingdom endures. They have lost, those who denied the signs of God and committed what was not committed by those who wronged aforetime. To this testifies He Who speaks the truth from God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>

After these words were submitted, from the Dawning-Place of knowledge appeared:</p>
<p>“O Sulayman! We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid thee to turn toward Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me and made me know Thee and taught me and illumined me with the light of Thy unity. I beseech Thee by Thy Prophets and Thy chosen ones who strove in Thy path with true striving and sacrificed their spirits and whatsoever they possessed in Thy love and Thy Cause, that Thou make me to be among those whom nothing whatsoever prevented from Thy remembrance, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I beseech Thee, O my God and my Lord and my Goal and the Goal of the world, to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones, then write down for me the good of this world and the next.

This servant also conveys greetings to him and beseeches from God, exalted be His glory, that which will assist him in His remembrance and praise and knowledge.

<p>Your letter was received, bringing fresh joy and adorning the horizon of love with a new radiance. Praise be to God that you enjoy the blessing of good health, which is the most excellent of divine bounties. Praise and thanks be unto Him through the eternity of His names and attributes. Regarding what the honored master Sabri Efendi (upon him be 66 9 [Baha’u’llah]) mentioned, it is correct, but this matter is very difficult since no one appears to be available now to organize these affairs. There are friends of every kind, but according to what was heard here, they say you yourself must go to the consul and make a declaration, and the consul must know you, therefore this becomes difficult for you. Now it has been decided that you should represent the father and mother on behalf of the people of the Remembrance, and likewise whatever needs to be written should be written. Here His Honor Aqa Jamal (upon him be from all 9 [Baha] the Most Glorious) will write according to the religious law of Persia, and these people who are here will seal it and send it - perhaps it will be accepted, since His Honor Navvab (upon him be 66 9 [Baha’u’llah]) is making great efforts. The previous letter apparently did not reach him. Although this approach is not definitive - the definitive approach is what Sabri Efendi mentioned - but so that you do not incur new harm or fall into difficulty, for now what was mentioned will be written and sent, until God wills what He wills. The command is in His hand and He has power over all things. To the gentlemen and family and light of eyes (upon them be the peace of God), I send greetings and praise. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

Say: In the descent of afflictions upon the righteous, and the burning of the hearts of the pure ones, and the exile of the friends from their homelands are signs for those who remember. Say: By God!

For they are mirrors of oneness and they tell of destiny between the heavens and the earth. Say: Die in your wrath, O people of hatred! God has raised us to a station which your hands and your spirits can never reach. Return then to your abode in the fire, O company of the deceivers! Say: All affairs are in the grasp of God, the Supreme, the Powerful. Say: When you behold God’s chosen ones upon the dust of abasement, know with certainty that they are reposing upon the thrones of glory. By God! If their heads were to be raised upon spears, you would hear from their tongues the remembrance of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Ancient, and would find from them the fragrance of musk - this is from God’s bounty upon them and upon His detached servants. Say: If they sacrifice a head in God’s path, God will surely give them a thousand heads in return - this is what has been ordained by God, the Mighty, the Generous. Say: God is the Powerful, the Triumphant, from Whose knowledge nothing escapes and Whom nothing can frustrate, and He encompasses all things. God will soon raise up His Cause in truth and will waft the breezes of glory upon the oppressed, and the Bird of Unity will sing in the midst of heaven that this is the Day wherein God will assist His Cause.

Then remove yourselves from the world and its ornaments and place your trust in God, that the winds of God’s mercy might blow upon you and the breezes of the Spirit might take hold of you and transform you from the left hand of limitation to the right hand of oneness, and cause you to enter the fortress of guidance and the house of divine authority, that you may abide therein forever.

They have cast aside the Self-Subsisting and followed delusion - nay, they know not.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn! Hear the call from the precincts of the Prison. He has testified to that which God testified before the creation of earth and heaven - that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. There has come before the Wronged One thy letter which thou didst send to him who circled round Me on the day when the seekers circumambulated the House of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Wronged One has heard thy call and answers thee with this clear Book. We make mention of thee and those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: O people of God! Ye have attained to My mention and the traces of My Pen. Give thanks unto God for this great favor. Blessed is he who has held fast to His cord and uttered His praise and arisen to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. How many a king was prevented from turning to Him, and how many a servant turned and attained to the recognition of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>
<p>The names mentioned in the letter have each attained, through God’s grace, exalted be His glory, to the lights of the Sun of divine remembrance. We beseech the Lord of existence to make each one firm and steadfast as a mountain in His Cause, and to aid them in that which leads to the exaltation of the Word of God and the advancement of His servants. We make mention of My handmaidens there and give them glad tidings of My beautiful remembrance. The Glory be upon you from Us, O My loved ones, and upon them and upon all who are steadfast and firm. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Mulla Mawla! He is the Mighty, the Great!</p>
<p>We have drawn forth the Finger of Power from the Sleeve of Might and with it have rent asunder the veils. Thereupon the people of allusions fell unconscious in the wilderness of their purposes. Thus has the matter been decreed from before God, the Lord of all men. Blessed is he who has cast away vain imaginings and idle fancies and has arisen at this Call, by which bodies have taken flight. Whosoever tarries today, even for less than a moment, all his deeds are rendered void, unless he returns unto God, the Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O people! Look not at what you possess, but rather at what is with your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. You were created for immortality, yet We see you hastening toward extinction. This is indeed a wondrous thing. This is the Day whereof you were promised in the Books of God, and wherein you were promised the presence of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Say: You were created for the meeting with God, yet you wander distracted in the wilderness of remoteness and separation. Say: Sanctify your ears to hearken unto the Word of God, and your hearts to recognize this Light which has shone forth from the horizon of the Will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>The cloud of bounty has been raised up and the Hand of giving has emerged from the Sleeve of the Most Glorious, yet the people remain in heedlessness and hypocrisy. Among them is he who sees a straw as silver and darkness as light. He is indeed among those who have gone astray. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of remembrance from the utterance of thy Lord, arise to promote the Cause in such wise that the allusions of them that are veiled shall not hold thee back from His praise. Say: O people! This is the Cause through which the decree of origination has been established, and this is the Remembrance by which all remembrances have been adorned. Through His manifestation the mysteries have been revealed and that which was recorded in the Tablets has come to light. Fear God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him Who has come to you with clear proof and evidence. Thus does the Pen of the All-Merciful move to make thee soar in the atmosphere of glory and knowledge. When thou attainest unto this Tablet say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind!</p>

<p>We have begun this day by remembering one who attained unto the recognition of God when every heedless and remote one was debarred therefrom. This is the day wherein the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha was raised and the Cock of the Throne crowed, when the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We counsel Our loved ones with that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted in these days wherein every wise command hath been made manifest. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when the servants turned away, save those whom God desired, the Lord of the worlds. Be thou vocal in the praise of thy Lord, soaring in the atmosphere of His love, and steadfast in the service of His Cause. Thus doth command thee He with Whom is the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy father who hath ascended unto God. We testify that he hath attained unto the Supreme Companion, the station whose praise no swift scribe can recount. We make mention of him at this hour as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Blessed art thou, O thou who hast attained unto the choice wine of recognition when the All-Merciful came with a sovereignty that conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth. We testify that thou didst turn unto the Most Exalted Horizon and believe in God, the Lord of all beings, when He came with the truth with a wondrous command. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy son who was named Muhammad-Taqi by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Rejoice thou that thy letter which thou didst send unto Him Who circleth round My Throne hath come into the presence of the Servant Who standeth before My face, and We have remembered thee with this remembrance whose fragrance shall never be cut off from creation. Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, beareth witness unto this from this glorious station.

We have revealed the utterance in the form of a Tablet and sent it to those who have believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting - those whom the affairs of the people did not prevent, who turned to Us and said: “We believe in Thee, O God of the unseen and the visible!” We have desired at this time to give one of My loved ones to drink of the Kawthar of My loving-kindness from the hand of My bounty, that he may attain to such a station where the happenings of the world shall not sadden him, nor shall the might of the earth and its divines cause him fear - they who have broken God’s covenant and His testament and led His friends into the shadow of darkness. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness, as the Lord of all beings was seated upon the throne of His Most Glorious Name, that thou didst leave thy home, turning toward God, and didst traverse mountains and valleys, land and sea, until thou didst attain Our presence and hear the Call and witness that wherewith God’s books, the Lord of what was and what shall be, had given thee glad tidings. Blessed be thy countenance for having turned, and thy heart for having advanced toward the wronged Exile, Whom neither the veils of glory nor the obscuring veils of the people of error prevented. He arose amidst all beings and proclaimed with the most exalted call: “By God! That which ye were promised hath come to pass, and He for Whose meeting the heavens and earth were created hath appeared. Behold, O people, and be not of those who denied God’s proof and rejected His bounty and disputed His signs and turned away from Him on His promised Day.” Blessed art thou for that which My Most Exalted Pen hath testified concerning thee in this exalted station. We beseech God to aid thee to preserve that which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Loving. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My loved ones whom neither the world and its ornaments nor its trade and profit have prevented from My remembrance, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

Therefore, those souls who have drunk from the choice wine of divine love and partaken of the Kawthar of recognition are in all conditions turned toward Him and holding fast to the hem of His generosity, for that which is everlasting and enduring has been and will be the love of God and His recognition. Blessed are those souls who have attained to this exalted and most glorious station and become detached and free from all else but God.

<p>Haji Mulla Mahdi. In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible! God hath heard thy call and was aware of what befell thee. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge, and by the Pen of His command hath been inscribed a preserved Tablet of glory wherein is ordained the knowledge of what was and what will be, and wherein are recorded the mysteries of the Cause by the Pen of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Be thou a lamp of the love of thy Lord amongst His servants, that the receptive ones may be illumined thereby. Consider the lamp: though it be but one, yet from it can be lit, as God willeth, lamp after lamp, all drawing their light therefrom. Even so, consider the hearts of them that have detached themselves from all else but God and have turned unto the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. By My life! Should the lamp of any heart be lit with the love of God, from it would be kindled the hearts of all creation. This, verily, is a manifest truth. Yet it behooveth every lamp-bearer to protect it from the winds of self and passion with the glass of the remembrance of the name of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. Thus doth the King of Names set forth parables as a bounty from His presence unto thee and unto them that are assured. Rejoice thou in thy Lord’s remembrance of thee and His mention of thee, for His remembrance precedeth all who remember and all who are remembered. Blessed is the man who is steadfast in His Cause, and the tongue that speaketh His praise and glory, and the heart that turneth unto Him in humility and submission. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee in His Cause and made thee a champion of His Faith and one who speaketh His praise. There is no God but He. He chooseth whom He pleaseth for His love, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Loving. Deliver unto the people the Cause of thy Lord and deal with them with patience, for they have not attained the summit of utterance and are among the weak ones. The glory shining from the horizon of grace be upon thee and upon them that have detached themselves from the world and have turned unto the Lord of Names, whom the rejection of the idolaters hath not deterred.</p>

The Supreme Pen hath testified that there is none other God but Him, and that He is the One Who hath revealed Himself unto all things through His most beautiful names on the Day wherein the horizon of Divine Unity was illumined by the Sun of His Name, the All-Subduing Lord of all possibility. This is the Day wherein the Mystery of Divine Unity hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. With Him did the Day begin and with Him shall it end, and from Him have the lights appeared and unto Him have they returned. Blessed is he who hath seen with his own eyes and blessed is he who hath heard with his own ears that before which the mountains would have crumbled away. There is nothing that hath not been encompassed by the manifestations of the lights of Divine Unity. Among the people are those who have recognized and turned towards Him, and those who have remained heedless and turned away. Well is it with him who hath drunk the wine of Divine Unity from the cup which God hath made the fountainhead of the seas. He cannot be known through aught else beside Him nor can He be comprehended through anything other than Himself. And despite His manifestation in all things, He hath ever been sanctified above them and exalted beyond that which the people of mystical knowledge have uttered. Whoso hath recognized Him in His Manifestation hath attained unto Divine Unity, and whoso hath remained heedless is of the people of the veil. O thou who gazeth upon the Countenance of Divine Unity and drinketh from the cup of detachment, hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged in this Most Great Prison: There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Hold fast with power and assurance to this cord, which when it moveth, all created things become still and all contingent beings find peace, and when it becometh still, all who are in earth and heaven are stirred into motion. We have read thy letter and perceived from it the fragrance of thy love. We beseech God to aid thee in that which will cause thy mention to endure in the Kingdom and thy name to last in the Heaven of Remembrance.

At times it appeareth as a heaven adorned with the sun of utterance, the moon of certitude, and the stars of sciences and arts. In truth, the tongues of the world fall short of mentioning it, for in this Day the One Who conversed on Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation. The world is stirred by His utterance. One ray of His light struck the sea, and it became possessed of the pearls of wisdom and utterance; it struck the mountains, and they became possessed of mines. Say: O ye who are endowed with insight! The Tree is laden with fruit before your faces, and the palm tree of bounty with its ripe dates is manifest before your eyes. Seek not after vain imaginings, but hold fast unto that which is manifest and visible. Glory be to God! The Tree of the Furthermost Boundary with the fruits of inner meanings and utterance and the produce of proof and evidence is manifest before all heads, yet the deluded ones have abandoned it and occupy themselves with mention of a tree whose fruits are vain imaginings and whose leaves are idle fancies. Say: O ye who are endowed with insight! Hold fast unto justice and speak with fairness. Glory be to God! This Day hath another atmosphere, and this sea hath other waves. By the life of God!

Leave me not deprived of what lieth with Thee. Verily Thou hast power to do what Thou pleasest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Thou hast met the friends of God in every land. Convey to them the greetings of this Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace, exalted be His glory. Say: This is the day of service and assistance, and assistance hath been and shall ever be through goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. Strive ye, that perchance those who thirst in the wilderness of utterance may attain unto the ocean of inner meanings, that the listless may be quickened and the dead may attain everlasting life. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have quaffed the wine of mystic knowledge from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>The Supreme Pen proclaims: All souls have been created for the knowledge of God, and throughout all nights and days they waited expectantly for the days of His manifestation. Yet when the lights of the dawn of God’s Day shone forth from the horizon of His Will, all remained veiled, nay, turned away, except those who held fast to the cord of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Each soul clung to vain imaginings and thus remained deprived of the Lord of all beings. For instance, knowledge appeared specifically for the recognition of the Known One; nevertheless, the learned of the age have, because of it, remained debarred from the Truth - exalted be His glory and His mighty sovereignty - and are veiled from the Day of God and His presence. In all divine Books and heavenly Scriptures, the people were given glad tidings of the dawning-place of divine revelation and the dayspring of His verses. Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined and made resplendent with the lights of the Sun of the manifestation of the Most Great Name, all arose in denial and rejection. But ere long will they who turned away behold themselves in manifest loss. Blessed are those souls who in the Day of His manifestation attained unto the knowledge of God and arose to serve Him. Such souls are accounted before God as stars in a wondrous heaven. Blessed are they, then blessed are they! Your letter was seen in the Most Great Prison and your call was heard. God willing, you will at all times remain steadfast in the remembrance of God and will at every moment drink from the choice wine of recognition. We make mention of all the loved ones of God in this blessed leaf, that all may rejoice in His special favors and engage in serving His Cause in perfect love and unity. Thus have We remembered you and those who have turned to God in that place, and him who wrote your letter. Verily your Lord is the Rememberer, the Rewarder, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>In the name of Him Who hath been made a prisoner in the land by the oppressors. The Supreme Pen proclaims: Whatsoever hath been manifested from the Ancient Beauty hath been a proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Were the servants to reflect, they would become assured of His sovereignty through His arising amidst His enemies, and would acknowledge His power. However, as they walk in the wilderness of self and desire, they remain veiled from the dawning of the Sun of Baha from the horizon of eternity, and have turned unto those who would protect themselves from a gnat, thus depriving themselves of the Beauty of Divine Unity. Say: O people! My deeds, like My manifestation, shine resplendent between earth and heaven. Whosoever, in less than a moment, purifies his heart from satanic whisperings will attain unto the knowledge of the Lord of all worlds and the Master of the Day of Judgment. And thou, O servant, hearken unto the divine call and guard thyself from the venom of the souls of the idolaters. I swear by My beauty that today such a venom blows from the direction of the hearts of the idolaters that were it to pass over all the trees of human souls, it would deprive them all of their lofty, ripe and glorious fruits. Therefore, at all times take refuge in God, that thou mayest remain protected from the barren wind. Trust in God, thy Lord, fear no one, and be of the detached ones. Make My remembrance thy shield and thy trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful, thy fortress. God willing, through the breezes of the divine springtime thou shalt attain unto the fruits of knowledge and inner meanings. And the light that hath shone forth from the direction of the Ancient Beauty be upon thee and upon those who have passed by this world and all that is therein like the passing of clouds.

<p>The Book of God hath been sent down in truth for people who know. He is God - there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all return unto Him. He guideth whom He pleaseth through His grace, and leaveth those who disbelieve - verily they are a people confounded. They have taken their desires and cast guidance behind them, and they are a blind people. Their desires have seized them in such wise that they know not the right hand from the left, and they hasten in the wilderness of ignorance while they perceive not. Among the people are those who have turned away from the truth by following the creation, and among them are those who have gone astray in the valley of passions after We showed them this exalted path, and among them are those who are occupied with wealth, heedless of their final end, and among them are those who gather but know not for whom they gather - verily they do not understand. Most people have been consumed by the fire of greed and desire while they perceive it not. Blessed is the soul that hath cast off the garment of greed and departed from the world out of love for God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Such a one is among the horsemen of this field - the All-Merciful sendeth His blessings upon him in this praiseworthy station. Reflect, O My loved ones, upon those who came before you - did what they possessed profit them? We cause the earth to be inherited by whomsoever We please. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Be ye trustees of God in His earth - this will profit you in this world and the next, did ye but know. Grieve not for that which ye have been denied - trust in God in all conditions. He hath ordained for you naught but what is best for you, did ye but know. O servant! Be thou thankful that the grace from this hidden quarter hath encompassed thee. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God and His chosen ones, upon whom shall come no fear nor shall they grieve. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Single, the One, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Therein He mentioneth that which draweth hearts unto the Supreme Horizon, this Station wherefrom the Tongue proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>

Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken in this luminous station. By God! The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Lord of Names hath come with the kingdom of signs, yet most of the people remain heedless.</p>
<p>Say: Arise to fulfill My Cause, and proclaim before all faces: “O people! Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers.” He hath come, by Whose beauty the eyes of the Concourse on High have been solaced, and there hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty and grace that which hath drawn unto it the hearts of them who are nigh unto God. Open your eyes, for the Hidden Name of God hath appeared, and that which was treasured from time immemorial, if ye be of them who know.</p>
<p>This is He Whom the Books of God and His Prophets and Messengers have foretold. This is the Day of Remembrance and Utterance, and this is the Day of Service and Praise. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve the Cause - he is indeed among those who have attained in My wondrous Book.</p>
<p>Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth as a grace from Our presence, and I am verily the Speaker, the All-Knowing. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold thee, or the doubts of the nations who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds, prevent thee.</p>

Place thy trust in God in all matters. Beware lest the events of the world sadden thee. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Possessor of existence.

These are the ones who quaffed the Choice Sealed Wine in this Revelation. Verily, upon them the angels descend from every side. Peace be upon you inasmuch as you have attained the Days of God, the Gracious, the Forgiving. Indeed, these are the ones who are not kept back by the world, though they rule upon the East and the West of the earth. Verily, it is by them that the clouds have rained their rain, and darkness hath been chased away by light. The Mercy of God that hath encompassed females and males be upon them. As for them who have disbelieved in Him, they indeed are deserving of chastisement. They shall verily enter the fire. Thus hath it been decreed in the recorded Tablet.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Do ye protest against Him in Who’s Name the Truth appeared, and the Balance of Justice hath been raised, and the Trumpet hath been blown? Fear ye God, O people, and walk not in the footsteps of them who disbelieve the presence of the All-Merciful. Follow ye the People of God, the Creator of darkness and light. Say: He hath verily offered up the Manifestation of Himself as a ransom for summoning you to draw nigh unto the station foreordained for you by the Flowing Pen.</p>
<p>I swear By Him! Were God to rend the veils asunder, you would offer up yourselves as a sacrifice for His Love. He, in truth, has the knowledge of all things, which He revealeth not save in a preordained measure. Say: “Fear God and spread not disorder on earth after it hath been well-ordered, neither shed the blood of anyone, for such things are forbidden you in the Book and in this Outspread Roll.”</p>

Cleanse thou thine heart of attachment to all the vain allusions of men, and persevere in the path of thy Lord, the God of all names and attributes, that He may aid thee with a power and might from Himself, and render thee victorious over all people of iniquity who disbelieve in God, the Lord of the Frequented Fane.

<p>The letter was presented before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison, and that which was inscribed therein was brought to the attention of Him Who is present before God. Consider the heedless souls who all acknowledge and confess that the True One, exalted be His glory and greatness, will appear either in His Own Person or through the Manifestation of His Cause, and the divine Books bear witness to this truth. He saith: “On the day when thy Lord shall come, or some of the signs of thy Lord shall come,” and in another place He saith: “And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,” and many similar utterances have appeared from the Daysprings of divine revelation and are recorded in the Books. Nevertheless, when the morn of the divine Day dawned and the horizons were illumined with the lights of the Sun of manifestation, all were observed to be veiled by the darkness of their idle fancies from the Dayspring of light. Consider the remaining proofs: The people of the Torah were veiled from the Truth by the Torah itself, and likewise all other peoples, each clinging to a book, remained deprived of Him Who revealed it. Behold the heedlessness and remoteness of the servants! This is a Day wherein the True One hath appeared in His Own Person, and the equivalent of all the aforementioned Books possessed by the people is, should God so will and desire, revealed in but a few days. Yet despite this they remain veiled. Furthermore, whatsoever hath come to pass and shall come to pass in the world hath previously flowed from the divine Pen with such clarity that no fair-minded person can deny it. Nevertheless, they have arisen in opposition. What proof could be greater than this, and what evidence more exalted than that which hath been mentioned? Say: In the Name of God and by God, take thou the choice wine of certitude in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink thereof through My remembrance, the All-Wise.

They who heard the Call and answered it - these are the people of Paradise, mentioned in a mighty Tablet. Their names have been recorded in all the worlds of God, and for them therein is a noble station. As for those who hesitated - these have no part in the Cause and are among the perplexed. They imagine themselves to be people of truth - nay, they are among the most lost! They say “We believed in God,” yet when He appeared in truth they denied Him. Lo! They are among the liars. And when they are told that which their desires approve not, they turn upon their heels. Lo! They are among the abased. When We show them the signs, they say “These are but forgeries,” and when the sun of clear proofs shines forth they say “This is naught but manifest sorcery.” The people of the Kingdom marvel at what proceeds from their mouths, and the denizens of the realms of might curse them, yet most people are heedless. They behold the signs of God, then deny them - thus were they aforetime, and in this most wondrous and glorious Manifestation. Be not grieved at anything. Put thy trust in God - verily He preserves whom He willeth by His sovereignty. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Generous. Arise to aid the Cause in such wise that nothing in creation shall prevent thee from remembering thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people of truth! Beware lest what is with creation veil you. By My life! They soar in the atmosphere of vain imaginings and cling to what they found with their fathers. Lo! They are in evident doubt. Blessed is he who cast away what is with men out of love for God, the King, the Single, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Yet the cities of the world and most of their inhabitants remain deprived and forbidden from the fragrances of the days of God and the rain of His mercy.

<p>It will have been known to the friends of God that one day the antichrist arose with a new scheme, in order to sow doubts in the hearts of the servants. Yes, in Edirne he advertised his intention to the Iranians, saying, “Today we have resolved that he shall come to the Sultan Selim mosque, and we also shall attend, and shall make the truth manifest. Thus might truth be distinguished from falsehood.”</p>
<p>Mir Muhammad Shirazi became aware of this saying, and informed Aqa Mirza Muhammad Quli. The latter repeated it in the most glorious presence. When he was informed, he departed that very hour and set out for the above-mentioned mosque. There are more details, but we shall mention only those necessary to telling the story. He said to Mir Muhammad, “Go and inform the gentleman that I am waiting in the mosque.” The aforementioned Mir Muhammad gave the news to that accursed one. Azal excused himself, saying that it was not possible that day. “The appointment will have to be fixed on another day.”</p>
<p>Then Mir Muhammad said to that wicked one, “You yourself chose these arrangements. You stated a preference for this matter. You wrote a document saying that whoever did not appear today is false and far from the truth. Then how can any word of yours be depended upon?”</p>
<p>In short, he stayed at the mosque until sundown, but that wicked one avoided coming. As he passed through the market, the tongue of God addressed Mir Muhammad with these holy and eternal verses. All the people heard it, and were astonished at their revelation. This is the content of the aforementioned discourse:</p>
<p>When we heard, we issued from our house with manifest sovereignty. We said, “Muhammad, the spirit has departed from its seat and along with it the spirits of the pure ones went forth, as did the realities of the Messengers. In truth, you shall behold the people of the most exalted panorama above my head. Then in my grasp are the proofs of the prophets. Then open your eyes. This is `Ali [the Bab], then Muhammad, the messenger of God, who has risen above the horizon of the House with evident sovereignty and come to you with all the verses from God, the mighty, the Omnipotent.”</p>
<p>Say: Were all the clergy and mystics on earth, and all the kings and emperors, to be gathered, I would stand before them and recite the verses of God, the king, the glorious, the wise. I am he who fears no one, even should all who are in the heavens and the earth assemble against me. The very verses have humbled themselves before my countenance, and all sounds are submissive before my wondrous and most amazing melodies. This is my palm, which God has rendered white for all the worlds. And this is my staff. Were we to cast it down, it would swallow the entire creation. All that has been created between the heavens and the earth is but a handful of clay to your lord.</p>
<p>Go, Muhammad, to the concourse of idolaters and say, “The youth has come to you and with him are the hosts of revelation and inspiration. The kingdom of the Cause marches before him, and behind him are the tribes of the concourse on high and the inhabitants of the cities of eternity then the angels who are near.” Say: Fear God, and do not oppose the one by whose command every wise decree was ordained. Then come into the presence of God with your ropes and your staffs and with whatever you possess, if you are able to do so. We go now to the house of God that was erected by one of the kings and named the “Selim.” I, alone, have come to you from the dawning place of eternity with a great, a most great announcement. I shall wait until the sun sets in the west, so that perhaps my opponents will find the opportunity within themselves to repent.</p>
<p>Know that God forbade his friends from meeting with the idolaters and hypocrites. Nevertheless, we departed from our house depending upon God, gaze set toward the precincts of the Cause, so that thereby the heedless servants of God might be made aware. Those who have denied God or joined partners with him shall never believe in God, even should he bring them the sacred scrolls, or the hosts of the Invisible, or the proofs of the Messengers [and meeting with God only increases them in their oppression and unbelief. Thus was it revealed in the tablets, and in this mighty and inaccessible Tablet.</p>
<p>Know, Muhammad, that every Name that is related to my self has been exalted in the kingdom of names, if you but knew. Say: Today, the bond with all loved ones has been severed, save for those who entered under the shadow of this radiant and illumined Countenance. Whoever clings to one of the divine Names, while turning away from its Creator, is not of me, and God is innocent of him. In truth, we created the names just as we created any other thing, if you but knew. Say: Verily, I have manifested myself for the sake of God, and have gone out for the sake of God, and I speak before all who are on earth just as I speak before your face. I fear no one. My actions testify to that, if you but knew. Say: In truth, the signs of the Absolute Truth are as obvious as the light and rays of the sun. Nay, by God, they are even more apparent to anyone with sharp vision. Do you think anyone other than he can exist alongside him? No, by his exalted and mighty self. Say: All the realities of all things walk when this youth walks, and when he becomes still, so too do our steadfast servants. Sever yourself from the Names, and be satisfied with your Lord, and be not among the ignorant. Those who have devoted themselves to the divine names, they are worshippers of idols, if you would bear witness. Verily, a prophet is one who prophesies to the people of these pre-existent and most precious tidings. A messenger is one who fulfills my mission to those who have lost their path. The vicar [imam] is one who stands before my countenance with manifest humility. The lieutenant [vali] is one who seeks shelter in the fortress of my secure protection. The successor [vasi] is one who counsels the people with what we have commanded them in a guarded tablet.]</p>
<p>He whom the idolaters have taken to themselves as their lord, whereby they have risen in opposition to God, the mighty, the august, the beautiful�“he was just like any of the servants. He used to come into my presence morning and night. Then there wafted upon him from the region of his base self the gales of passion, as a result of his past behavior. Finally, they cast him down off his seat and abandoned him in the lowest depths. We had made his name renowned among the servants for a secret reason of our own. In truth, your lord is ruler over what he desires.</p>
<p>Also, there is a man by the name of Hasan Aqa in that land, a tobacconist. The antichrist was with him when he issued the aforementioned challenge. The text was written out with his knowledge. Indeed, in reality on that day the truth was fulfilled and perfect. Rather, it became most seasoned and most perfect.</p>
<p>When Mir Muhammad came into the presence of the Beauty of God, he said, “I informed that accursed one (that is, Mirza Yayha), that Baha’u’llah was waiting in the mosque, and I said, `You should come and demonstrate your own truth.’</p>
<p>“That accursed one said, `Today it will have to be postponed. Choose another day.’”</p>
<p>Afterwards the tongue of God spoke forth, saying that with God it had been known that that scoundrel would not appear, and the purpose was to complete the proof. Rather, the proof had been complete from pre-eternity against those deniers of the beauty of the lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The beauty of God departed from the mosque. It so happened that the store of the aforementioned Hasan Aqa was on Baha’u’llah’s route. When he arrived at the store, the tongue of God said, “Based on the decision that the gentleman had announced in his proclamation, the countenance of the All-Merciful presented himself, whereas the idolaters repudiated their own agreement.”</p>
<p>The next day, this sublime pronouncement was issued to Hasan Aqa. But that accursed one gave it no attention. The text of the letter is as follows:</p>
<p>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>This is a letter from this youth to all who are upon the earth. Worship none but God, the king, the exalted, the mighty. Thus has the decree been revealed in all the tablets from the powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>We heard that some of our opponents desired to come into the presence of this youth. Say: Come, and do not delay! We have appointed as the meeting-place the house of God, which was erected by one of the emperors, and was called “Selim” in the kingdom of names, if you but knew. We have selected as the days for the meeting Sunday and Monday. God was a witness to what I say . . . He is the one intended by your lord, the knowing, the wise.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Bounty and Grace</p>
<p>Thy letter was received and attained the presence of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, the fragrance of recognition wafteth from it and the sweet-scented breeze of the love of the All-Merciful emanateth therefrom. Today all must fix their gaze upon the supreme horizon alone, detached from all else, and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant victory to the people of divine unity. Today the world of polytheism is united while the realms of unity are divided, and this division hath caused the abasement of the people of truth. Unity and accord have ever been the cause and means of exalting the Word. We beseech God to illumine the horizons of the hearts of His loved ones with the light of unity. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As to thy intention to come at this time - it is not permitted, as newly arisen circumstances prevent it. We beseech God to bestow the reward of attaining His presence. Whatever hath befallen that honored one in the path of God hath caused no harm and never shall. By the life of God! Soon shall the abasement of His loved ones be transformed into glory and the poverty of His chosen ones into wealth. Had this world any worth in the sight of God, His loved ones would have been born from their mothers’ wombs in complete glory. Were what He hath ordained for His loved ones to be revealed unto thee, even less than the eye of a needle, wonder would seize thee and thou wouldst exclaim: “This is naught but the bounty of our Lord, the Generous, the Bestower!” Blessed art thou and blessed is he who was mentioned in thy letter. We send Our greetings upon thee and upon him from this glorious and exalted station. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Seyyed Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. We send Our greetings upon his countenance and beseech God to aid him to remember Him and serve His mighty Cause.</p>

O leaf! Be not grieved at what hath befallen thee. Be patient and steadfast, for thy Lord is the Protector of those who are patient, women and men. Dost thou imagine that he is lost? Nay, by My life! Rather, he hath fallen asleep and risen in haste unto the Kingdom of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Dost thou imagine that he is dead? Nay, by His most truthful Self! He is alive in both worlds, beholding the Glory from the Supreme Horizon, and towards him are directed the glances of the Wronged One from this remote Prison. I see him and he seeth Me. Were I to elaborate upon this station, all would turn with contentment to that which hath been ordained by the Pen of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. When thou perceivest the fragrance of loving-kindness from the Tablet of thy Lord, the Lord of all creation, turn thou unto God and make mention of that which hath been sent down from His mighty and impregnable Pen: “O my God and my Master! I am a handmaiden among Thy handmaidens who hath turned unto the Kaaba of Thy oneness and the Sanctuary of Thy detachment. I beseech Thee, by the one whom Thou didst sacrifice in Thy path and didst cause to be spent for the acceptance of Thy creatures, to number me among such women as have believed in Thee and in Thy signs and have been well-pleased with that which Thy Pen of decree hath ordained for them in the Tablets of Thy Judgment, and who circle round Thy Will and Purpose. O Lord! I am she who hath turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Preserve me, then, through Thy power and sovereignty, and kindle within my heart, by the hand of Thy bounty, the lamp of joy. Verily, Thou art powerful to do as Thou pleasest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful. O Lord! Withhold me not from the wonders of Thy grace, nor from the effulgences of the Sun of Thy favors and bounties. Then write down for me that which is best with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Beautiful.”</p>

<p>O Siyyid Mahdi! Your letter which was written to Kalim was received and perused. However, mournful fragrances wafted from its words in such manner as to increase the sorrow of the Sorrowful Beauty. Although these are days of sorrow, yet concealed within them is a joy the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. Today you must at all times remind the people through wondrous mention, and be not grieved by their acceptance or rejection. Say: I make mention solely for the sake of God and desire neither recompense nor thanks. You sent an account - you have been and will remain trustworthy, God willing. You shall not be called to account for what you mentioned, and that which you shall be called to account for is My command, the difficult made easy. Grieve not over anything, but in all that befalleth thee place thy trust in thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Not for an instant is delay permitted in teaching the Cause of God, for the deniers have appeared with a scheme the like of which hath never been heard of in creation. Convey My greetings to all the friends, both Arab and Persian, and say: O people, remain steadfast in the Cause of God and His love, then detach yourselves from all else. And if you ask about conditions in this land and what hath befallen Me, at all times I have been and am afflicted at the hands of the murderous enemy, the irreligious Khuli, the obstinate Shaddad, the rejected Nimrod, the accursed Pharaoh, the stubborn Jews, the envious Abu Jahl, and the hateful Cain. Thus have I been and thus shall I remain unless God should change the situation, for He hath power over all things. Remind Mirza Mahdi and the friends of the sorrow of this Prisoner, and likewise the members of the household. Dominion on that Day shall be God’s. Remember Majid.</p>

<p>This is a Tablet of Baha to him who was saddened by the calamities that befell him in this world, that the joy of his Lord’s call might seize him after his sorrows. O Most Exalted Pen! Give him to drink from the ocean of gladness which floweth in Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, that he may cast away his sorrows and turn with spirit and fragrance unto the All-Merciful. O My servant! Behold and thou shalt see the Water of Life surging before thy face. Hath sorrow overtaken thee at the death of thy son? Then the Son of God calleth out to thee, saying: “By God! This is a father to him that hath no father, a son to him that hath no son, and a companion to him that hath no companion.” Thereupon were the realities of all things stirred by the breezes of thy Lord’s mercy, the Lord of all names. Wouldst thou remember sorrow after this? This beseemeth not, by My Beauty that shineth upon all possibility! Thus have We caused the wine of joy and ecstasy to flow from this Pen which God hath made the Dayspring of inspiration. Verily, he who hath ascended is in the Most Glorious Horizon, seized by the vibration of thy Lord’s favor in such wise that he seeth neither right nor left. Can aught in all creation compare with but a trace from thy Lord’s Pen? Nay, by My Self that encompasseth all regions! Were all who dwell in creation to turn to this Tablet alone, by God, the rapture of thy Lord’s utterance would so seize them that they would be separated from their bodies and soar in this atmosphere wherein the tongue of grandeur proclaimeth: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, Who hath manifested the Cause without veil or covering, and delivered unto the kings what He desired, and neither their might nor their tyranny prevented Him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.” Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee and singled thee out for this Tablet which God hath made the embellishment of proof. Blessed art thou for having held fast to the cord of patience and been content with what God hath decreed. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

We have sent it unto thee that through it the horizons may be illumined. Arise and take it with spirit and fragrance, then recite it with the melody of the heart. By My life! It will draw thee to the heaven of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. When thou art illumined by the lights of the Face and art revived by the fragrances of the Robe, arise amidst the servants and say: O people! The Promised Day is come. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world and hath come with the Covenant. Those who have turned away, these are they whom the wine of heedlessness and rebellion hath overtaken, and thereby have they been debarred from this Kawthar which hath flowed from the mouth of the will of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious. O people! He hath sacrificed Himself for your deliverance. Fear God and follow not those who, when the All-Merciful came, turned away and denied the proof. Say: We have opened the gates of Paradise before your faces - how long will ye flee to the fire? Do ye see for yourselves any place of escape? Nay, by the Lord of the Day of Mutual Disillusion! Say: Have ye not heard how We sent one among the servants with power from Our presence and dispatched him with a Tablet whereby We blew the trumpet in the heartland of Iran, causing all in the heavens and earth to swoon, save those whom the hand of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, did rescue? Say: We have forsaken ease and accepted every hardship that perchance ye may arise from the couch of heedlessness and passion and hasten unto God, the Cleaver of the Dawn. Do ye doubt His Cause? Verily He hath appeared with the truth and everything proclaimeth: The Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling hath come! When thou findest them not hearing, grieve not. Open thy tongue in utterance and remind the people in the days of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Forgiving. Associate with the people, for they know not - had they known, they would circle round the Cause at eventide and at dawn. And the glory be upon thee and upon him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Concealing.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, Who is manifest above all things! This is an epistle from Him Who remembereth God with His tongue from eventide until dawn, and from dawn His pen moveth upon the tablets until sunset, that perchance faces may turn unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. I have sacrificed my soul in His path and my comfort for His Cause, and I show no patience after His decree even should the oppressors seize me. And aforetime the verses would descend and the servant present before the Throne would write them down. And in those days, due to the weakness which had overtaken me, no voice would arise from the Ancient Tongue, as ye know. And when it would arise, all my limbs would shake such that the verses of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, would overwhelm me. And at the time of revelation, such longing would seize me that my very members would quiver from the love of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. And aforetime the verses would descend from dawn unto dawn and from sunset unto sunset, and the Tongue of God would not pause for less than a moment save for another purpose. Thus was the matter ordained, and to this do testify God’s sincere servants who were present before His face and heard the verses of God, the Mighty, the Loving. And in those days if I speak for an hour, weakness preventeth Me in another hour. The melodies of God have been stilled by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought, yet they perceive not. I summon the people through My pen even as I summoned them through My tongue, and I shall not cease in that which I have been commanded until the spirit ascendeth to its seat of majesty and glory. Thus hath the Youth desired in the path of His Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O servant! Be thou even as the Youth was. If matters be confined to the remembrance of thy Lord, this is better for thee than what hath been and what shall be. Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. And sovereignty and dominion shall remain with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Thus hast thou been commanded from before the presence of the Glory, around which circle all things, crying out: “By God, the Beloved of all worlds hath come!” Let not the world and its ornaments grieve thee. Be thou content with thy Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven. Within His grasp are the keys to the treasuries of the heavens and earth. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Qiblih of the Messengers, heard His call and turned unto Him. This is of thy Lord’s favor - verily His favor to thee is great. Say: O people! Another cycle hath come and the All-Merciful hath appeared with great sovereignty. Read ye the Bayan that ye may become aware of the mysteries of this Revelation which hath dawned from the horizon of glory and power through a mighty command. This is He Who accepted harm for your deliverance and sacrificed Himself for your life. Fear ye God and follow not every froward devil. Can anyone speak in His presence? Nay, by the Lord of the Throne! But the people are behind a thick veil. Can anyone stand against Him? Nay, by His truth, were ye of them that know! Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thou mayest help thy Lord, the Lord of all names and attributes. We desired by this naught save thy exaltation and the elevation of thy station. Verily thy Lord is the Ruler over what He willeth, and praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

And now, since We are a traveler unto God, We have sufficed with what We have imparted unto thee in truth, that thou mayest be of those who are certain. And verily, that which the people speak of is pure falsehood, and what hath been detailed from God is the truth, and We are among those who bear witness. And the Spirit and glory be upon you, O concourse of the sincere ones.</p>

<p>O Siyyid Husayn of Manshad, upon him be the Most Holy, the Most Glorious Beauty of God! This is the Kawthar of immortality which We have manifested in truth and sent forth in the form of a Tablet, dispatching it unto thee that thou mayest be of the thankful. By My life! In every word thereof lieth concealed the Salsabil of meanings and utterance. Blessed are they that drink thereof. Be thou in the path of thy Lord in such wise that the ornaments of the world shall not make thee heedless, nor shall the means of the heavens and earth occupy thee. Rise up in My Name and lay thee down in remembrance of Me - this sufficeth thee above all that hath been created in the earth entirely. Hearken unto the word of thy Lord - He is in truth the Counselor, the Faithful. When thou art enkindled with the fire of the love of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, turn unto those who are heedless of the remembrance of their Lord and say: O company of the veiled ones! I have come unto you from the Dayspring of the Cause with the Tablet of God, the Mighty, the Impregnable, and I summon you unto Him purely for the sake of God - verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware lest thou overstep the bounds of wisdom. Thus have We commanded in the Tablets, and none attain unto this save those whose hearts are illumined with the light of knowledge and whose faces are radiant with the lights of the countenance of thy Lord, the Most High, the Great. Say: He loveth not mischief and hath forbidden you in the Tablets from whatsoever giveth rise to sedition. Verily He is the Ruler over what He willeth. Say: Beware lest ye enter anyone’s house except with his permission, and beware lest ye pride yourselves over any of My servants by reason of what ye have been given of the ornaments of the earth. By My life! Soon shall perish all that ye behold, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of the All-Merciful in His days and turned unto Him after His servants who were created by His firm and mighty command had turned away from Him. Be thou thankful in all conditions. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me in Thy days and caused me to know Thy Self. I beseech Thee not to leave me to myself. Aid me in that which Thou desirest, for verily Thou art the Strong, the All-Purposing.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! This is a Tablet from Us to him who hath turned toward the Dayspring of Lights, that the fragrances of verses may attract him and draw him nigh unto God, the Subjugator of winds. They who have cast away desire and taken hold of guidance - these are of the people of Baha in the scriptures and tablets. And they who have turned away - these shall find for themselves no place of escape. How many servants have been so attracted by the verses that they became detached from all who are on earth, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower. These have fulfilled the Covenant after every idolatrous deceiver broke the pledge. Take thou the cup of life in the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink and say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou Whose knowledge encompasseth all created things. O Husayn! We have sent down verses unto thee before - this is yet another time - that thine eyes may be consoled thereby in this return. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Remind My loved ones there and kindle the lamp of their hearts with this remembrance which shineth forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s utterance, the Lord of all men. Say: We have kindled the fire of longing throughout all regions - seize ye the day, O company of ardent lovers! Remember thou Husayn who heard God’s call when he turned to the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most High. Then Husayn who visited the Throne and attained the presence of God on the Day of Gathering. Blessed are ye and your names which branch forth from the ocean of My Name, the One Who dominateth all who are in earth and heaven. Say: Be ye steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the lowing of the calf nor the croaking of those who claim what God hath not permitted them in the Book shall hinder you. Hold fast to the cord of oneness in this Day wherein the Spirit proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Mighty, the Compelling. And the glory be upon thee and upon them and upon thy progeny from thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving. We have not forgotten the Ruby - We call him to the Kingdom, and him who serveth thee to the Mighty, the Most High.</p>

<p>This is a Tablet that hath been sent down in truth, that it may draw men nigh unto God, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Verily, those who have turned towards Him, when the verses of their Lord are recited unto them, soar aloft with longing - these are the people of Baha, inscribed in a preserved Tablet. Draw ye nigh unto God with your hearts - this indeed is the true purpose. He hath come on the Day of Judgment. When We revealed a mystery from Our Most Great Mystery with clear proof and evidence, the people of the Bayan fell stunned upon the dust of idle fancy. Thus was the matter decreed by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Then rose up against Us the people of the Furqan in rebellion, until they cast Us into the Most Great Prison. Thus were We under the swords of the idolaters. We give thanks to God for this, and We summon the servants unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Tribulation is indeed the garment of Baha, did ye but know it. When it is in the path of my Lord, it is the crown of My head, were ye of them that are well-assured. Would that thou hadst been present before the Throne when We shone forth from the horizon of mystery with manifest sovereignty, and at the time when We were driven from the city wherein We dwelt with grievous tyranny, and hadst witnessed the power of God with thine own eyes and heard His verses with thine own ears. In those days the verses were sent down openly amidst all creation. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. Among the people were those whom the radiance of revelation overwhelmed, and they were struck down, and were among the perishing. And among them were those whom the attraction of the Compeller seized and raised to an exalted station. Until We arrived at the seashore, when one of the military chiefs came before Us. Then did the Tongue of Grandeur speak and informed him of what would appear thereafter, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. His condition was transformed and he nearly wept before Our face. Thus was the matter decreed by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that the steps of them that have turned aside shall not cause thee to slip, and remember Him in thy days. Verily, He is with His remembering servants. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Blessed are they whom trials have not prevented from turning to God and who have drunk the Kawthar of inner meanings from the hand of this Youth, Who hath come in the shadows of clouds, accompanied by the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Say: We gave you tidings aforetime of this Most Great Revelation and of these days. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of Him for Whose meeting ye were created. Fear God, O concourse of men! Say: Those who have denied God in this Revelation after He came unto them with the truth - these have no portion of this grace and these are as cattle. Say: O people, worship God Who created you by a sovereignty from Him and fashioned you as He pleased in the wombs, then brought you forth therefrom and was ever watchful over you until ye reached maturity. Then He sent unto you His Messengers with guidance and the true religion to summon you unto Him, for He is the Lord of grace and bounty. And thou - arise to serve the Cause of God and His love, and fear not the clamor of those who have emerged from the thickets, nor grieve at anything, for God shall soon send down what He hath ordained for thee - this is what We foretold thee aforetime in the Mother Book. In His hand is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and earth, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in the Book. Stand firm through the power of God, for He is with those who place their trust in Him and preserveth them from illness. Be independent through Him of all that hath been created between the heavens and earth - thus hath the Pen of Command enjoined thee, and it is the Sovereign of all pens. And the glory rest upon thee and upon those who are steadfast in the Cause - these are they whom God hath purified from the defilement of every wicked slanderer who denied God on the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Glorious! This is a Tablet which hath been sent down in truth and dispatched unto him who hath believed in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, on a day wherein the heaven was cleft asunder and knowledge was rolled up. Say: We desire from knowledge naught but the recognition of the Known One. Here He is, by the Lord of what was and what shall be! Tear asunder the greatest veil by the leave of God, the Lord of Destiny, then gaze toward the most luminous horizon wherefrom His hidden Beauty hath shone forth.

Say: Beware lest ye follow idle fancies after the Sun of Certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of the Command of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Know thou that when We arrived at the prison, We desired to convey unto all the messages of thy Lord, that they might know that tribulations have not deterred Us from the remembrance of God, the Lord of all names, nor have We been frightened by the might of them that oppress. We have created the wondrous through a word from Our presence and sent it forth like a globe of fire with the Tablet of thy Chosen Lord, wherein hath been sent down that which broke the backs of the wicked ones who disbelieved in God after He appeared with manifest sovereignty. Read it, that thou mayest know the power of thy Lord and become apprised of what hath been sent down therein from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. We have sent down therein from every matter whereby the eyes of them that are assured are consoled. Say: O people! Answer the Call of God and follow not every idolatrous rejecter. He hath come for your salvation - wherefore do ye not understand? Turn unto Him with your hearts; this is what ye have been commanded in a preserved Tablet.

Oppose not Him Who hath come for your life, and turn not away from Him to Whom the All-Merciful hath testified in all conditions that He is the Goal of all worlds. O people! He desired for you everlasting life, yet ye imprisoned Him in the prison of ’Akka.

Open your eyes that perchance ye may recognize your Lord, the All-Choosing One. Thus doth the Tongue of Revelation counsel you from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. O servant!

Do ye take desire and set aside your Lord, the Most Glorious? This indeed is a grievous wrong. Soon will come days wherein ye shall lament for your souls by reason of what ye neglected in the Cause of God, and shall find for yourselves neither intimate friend nor helper. Soar then with the wings of detachment in this atmosphere which God hath made sanctified from the knowledge of all who are on earth save those who have clung to this exalted Cord. Remind the servants and give them the glad-tidings of thy Lord’s command, that perchance they may arise from the slumber of desire and turn unto the Lord of Names. Thus have We commanded thee before and in this glorious Tablet. Remember those who are with thee from before thy Lord. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.</p>

<p>This is the Day whereon Carmel hath, in very truth, drawn nigh unto Him Who is the Lord of all strength and might, and raised its voice to proclaim from every direction: “O Carmel! Prostrate thyself, for the Ancient Beauty hath turned His countenance toward thee from His Most Exalted and Glorious Station. Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath made thee His Seat of Throne.” Thereupon did Zion cry aloud and say: “O peoples of the earth! Rejoice, for the Hidden One hath appeared - He Who was concealed in the treasuries of God’s protection, the Lord of all worlds.” Lo, the Sea proclaimeth, saying: “O Ocean! Blessed art thou, for upon thee hath sailed the Ark of God, the Lord of the Most Great Throne,” and the dwellers of the Concourse on High were so transported by the rapture of that Call that they arose from their most exalted seats and turned toward the Kaaba of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is the Day wherein the Light hath shone forth and the Mount declareth: “I have attained unto Him Who created me aforetime for this Blessed and Wondrous Day.” Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, who hath taken the cup of severance in the name of the Creator of all things, and drunk therefrom in the name of the Beloved, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Grieve not over anything, for thy name hath been mentioned before the Wronged One, and that hath been revealed for thee which hath caused the breezes of the Dawn of Revelation to waft over all who are in the heavens and on earth.

O Lord! Thou seest how Thy Call hath so enraptured me that the reins of choice have been taken from my hands by Thy command and will. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance and Thy Command, whereby the necks of Thy creation have been subdued, to make me in all conditions one who extols Thy praise among Thy servants and who holdeth fast to Thy firm cord.

<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds! Absolute Being cries out in utter nothingness, saying: At two times is the clamor and cry of the people of contingent existence raised up - once at the beginning, that is, at the first creation, and again at the return. Observe how when the Sun of Truth dawned from the horizon of the Divine Command in the name of Muhammad (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake), the people of the world rose up in opposition and raised their cry. Likewise at the time of return, when the Manifestation of the Divine Lordship appeared in the garment of servitude. Although the beginning is and ever shall be identical with the return. Blessed are they who beheld the seal in the mirror of the beginning, and likewise the beauty of the beginning in the mirror of the seal. In any case, in whatever manner and condition the Source of the Command has risen from the horizon of the world, the people have occupied themselves with rejection and opposition, and have not been content with God’s good-pleasure, save whom thy Lord willed. When the law of prayer was revealed in the time of the Messenger, the idolaters would prevent their ears from hearing the call to prayer and would count hearing it as evil. But after the divine power had encompassed all, most became aware and turned toward the horizon of certitude and held fast to the revealed divine ordinances. And when the reality of prayer and the hidden mystery appeared in the King of Days, again the cawing of the ravens was raised up. In no age have the people been content with that which God has willed, nor will they be, except for sanctified souls and illumined hearts. Therefore you must be thankful at all times, for you have drunk from the living waters of the peerless Kawthar and have turned toward the sanctuary of oneness. This is the most great bounty and the supreme grace. Ask God that you may remain steadfast in His love and firm in His Cause. The Glory be upon you.</p>

Though I firmly believe that Thou hast a greater compassion on them than they have on their own selves, though I recognize that Thou hast afflicted them for no other purpose except to proclaim Thy Cause, and to enable them to ascend into the heaven of Thine eternity and the precincts of Thy court, yet Thou knowest full well the frailty of some of them, and art aware of their impatience in their sufferings.</p>
<p>Help them through Thy strengthening grace, I beseech Thee, O my God, to suffer patiently in their love for Thee, and unveil to their eyes what Thou hast decreed for them behind the Tabernacle of Thine unfailing protection, so that they may rush forward to meet what is preordained for them in Thy path, and may vie in hasting after tribulation in their love towards Thee. And if not, do Thou, then, reveal the standards of Thine ascendancy, and make them to be victorious over Thine adversaries, that Thy sovereignty may be manifested unto all the dwellers of Thy realm, and the power of Thy might demonstrated amidst Thy creatures. Powerful art Thou to do what Thou willest. No God is there but Thee, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Make steadfast Thou, O my God, Thy servant who hath believed in Thee to help Thy Cause, and keep him safe from all dangers in the stronghold of Thy care and Thy protection, both in this life and in the life which is to come. Thou, verily, rulest as Thou pleasest. No God is there save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>

<p>O my handmaiden! Your call has attained the hearing of the Wronged One and your turning has been honored by the gaze of the Intended One. Be not grieved by what has come to pass. The loved ones of God belong to Him and are associated with Him, and whatsoever befalleth them hath been and is in accordance with the requirements of wisdom, and its traces and fruits shall assuredly appear on earth and become manifest in the assemblage of the world. Verily, he who hath ascended unto God hath attained the presence and visited a House which the Almighty built with the hand of His power, and a House which the Friend built by His command and will. As to the first, he entered it not, and as to the second, he departed not from it. Verily, he who visited the first and the second is among the people of inner meanings in this holy, mighty and inaccessible station. O my handmaiden! He hath attained that which causeth eyes to be consoled and hearts to be drawn. This station is most great. That handmaiden must occupy herself in the nights and days with the remembrance of the Goal of the worlds and be content with what hath been ordained from the Supreme Pen. Praise be to the Lord of the Kingdom Who hath mentioned thee through words with which none of the books of earth can compare, even to a single letter thereof. Convey greetings from the True One to all the handmaidens in that land. They must remain so steadfast on God’s path that neither doubts and vain imaginings, nor the cawing of the crows nor the clamor of the deniers shall hold them back or keep them from the Truth. Today the rain of bounty is pouring from the clouds of grace and descending. Blessed are the servants and handmaidens who have not been deprived and have taken their portion and share from the outpourings of God’s days. Today you are known by the Truth and associated with Him, and He sufficeth. Rejoice thou in this wondrous and glorious mention.</p>

<p>O friends of God in the B and H, and O My loved ones in the H and S! Hearken unto My call when the trumpet is sounded, and those in the graves arise, and all things proclaim: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting!” Ye have ever been and continue to be remembered before the Wronged One. Ye dwell in your homes while the Wronged One is confined in a mighty prison. He maketh mention of you and summoneth you to the supreme horizon. Today the gate of grace is opened wide and the ocean of bounty is manifest, and the Sun of Truth shineth forth and is evident - nay, speaking - from the horizon of the heaven of God’s will. Blessed is the eye that hath attained to behold, and the ear that hath been enabled to hear. Today the friends must fix their gaze upon that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Say: God; then leave them to their vain disputes.” Whosoever attaineth unto this station hath attained unto the most great steadfastness. Neither the clamor of the enemies’ chains nor the commotion of the parties shall thereafter prevent him from turning to the Lord of all beings. Today trust and orientation toward the Beloved are essential, that perchance there may appear from the friends that which shall endure forever in God’s Book. He is verily the Helper, the All-Bountiful. We beseech God to protect His party and to sanctify them from the doubts of the barking ones and the hints of the opposers. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the ornament of detachment and been illumined with the light of godliness. Such a one is the knight in the arena of inner meanings and utterance. Blessed be they who possess insight and they who hear. Command and will and protection are from God, the Lord of the worlds. O ’Abdu’l-’Ali! Thy name was present before the Wronged One and He made mention of thee in such wise as to attract the hearts of the unitarians. We beseech God to strengthen thee with such steadfastness as the hosts of the world and the armies of the oppressors shall not prevent. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O My loved ones! Hear ye My call. Verily it draweth you unto My horizon, and exalteth you among My servants, and maketh mention of you through that which hath appeared in My wondrous Day. We have revealed the verses and manifested that which was hidden in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. And We have sent down from the heaven of proof that which hath attracted the hearts of the sincere ones. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have cast away vain imaginings and taken hold of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

<p>Be ye in such a state that the happenings of the world grieve you not in this Day wherein the Lord of the Kingdom of Names calleth from this glorious and transcendent Spot. Verily, sorrow is forbidden save for that which hath befallen Us at the hands of the oppressors. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to comfort you and console you, and to open before your faces the doors of His bounty, and to ordain for you that which He hath ordained for His chosen ones and trusted ones. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He hath witnessed what hath befallen you and hath spoken that whereby your names and remembrances shall endure throughout the kingdom of the Mighty, the Praised.</p>

Thy remembrance hath ever been and shall continue to be mentioned in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. The atoms of all created things have testified and do testify to thy acceptance, thy devotion and thy service. The dwellers of the Supreme Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven, and those who circle round the Lord of all beings - all these bear witness to the compassion, the grace, the mercy, the bounty and the favors of the True One towards thee.

When thou art seized by the rapture of the scratching of My Pen and the breezes of revelation from My direction, say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, to Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty, to the mysteries of Thy Book and the lights of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee, O God of all beings and Educator of all created things, by Thy greatest signs and the revelations of Thy most exalted horizon, to strengthen me in that which will cause Thy Cause to be exalted among Thy creatures. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have laid hold on the cord of Thy grace and clung to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty. By Thy might and Thy majesty, I am content in all conditions with whatsoever hath appeared in Thy path and been manifested in Thy days. By Thy glory and Thy sovereignty, let not the vicissitudes of the world prevent me from drawing nigh unto Thee, nor its hardships from gazing toward the horizon of the heaven of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee by the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom and the waves of the ocean of Thy generosity to transform my hardship into ease and my difficulty into comfort. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust below. There is no God but Thee, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>

<p>He is the One Who calls between earth and heaven! O thou who gazest upon the Most Exalted Horizon! Hearken unto the Call of the Lord of all beings. He draweth thee unto a station where neither the might of the world will frighten thee nor will the hosts of the nations, who have remained heedless of this Most Great, this Mighty Cause, prevent thee. That which thou beholdest today shall perish, while the Kingdom and the Dominion will remain with God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: The Abu-Jahl of this age hath pronounced judgment against Muhammad the Apostle of God, and the Samiri against Him Who conversed with God, and the Jews against the Spirit, the Glorious, the Resplendent. And the people of the Furqan have risen against the Revealer of the Bayan, and the viper hath risen against God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Powerful - for it did bite My chosen ones who soared in My atmosphere, turned unto My face, drank the choice wine of My love, held fast unto My cord, and clung to My sanctified and holy and mighty and inaccessible hem. Observe then the people and their deeds. They have taken the viper as their leader instead of God and have committed that which hath caused the Concourse on High to lament and those who circle round My mighty Throne to weep. God hath seized it through His sovereignty and power from His presence, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have attained unto their desire and have sacrificed their souls and their wealth in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds, but the people have lost through their deeds. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. The Most Exalted Pen hath revealed in their remembrance that which all the treasures of the earth cannot equal. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of thy Lord, the Gracious. Blessed is the strong one whom the hosts of tyranny have not weakened, and the speaker who hath held fast unto My All-Wise Name. Say: Hold fast unto the cord of wisdom in all circumstances - this is what God hath decreed in most of the Tablets. He is verily the Expositor, the All-Knowing.

Soon shall all who dwell on earth glory in your names. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the Pen that ruleth over all pens. They are asleep; when they awaken they shall arise and say: “Would that we had chosen for ourselves a path unto the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting!” While in abasement, We summon the servants unto the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Say: Abasement is My glory, hardship My comfort, and tribulation the crown of Baha. Blessed are they who possess insight. We have accepted sorrows for the joy of the world. Soon shall the sincere ones behold the standards of victory upon the highest heights.

I testify that Thou art the Lord of the servants and the Educator of all who are in earth and heaven. We have accepted thee for My service. This is a word We have sent down for thee in the Tablet. It behooveth thee to glory therein amongst Our chosen servants. Wert thou to discover the influences of this word when it issued forth from the mouth of the Divine Will, thou wouldst soar with rapture and say: The bounty is Thine, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things!

Nevertheless, tremors seized the tribes of the earth and agitation encompassed the inhabitants of the lands. How many were the divines who remained deprived of the Water of Life, and how many were the mystics who were veiled from the rays of the Sun of inner meanings, and how many were those endowed with sight who are recorded as sightless in God’s Book, and how many were those possessed of ears who are forbidden to hear. Now if the call of Truth were to be raised as befitteth it, sanctified from suppositions and fancies and idle talk and from what hath been mentioned and known, what would they do? By God, verily the people are behind an evident veil.

Praise be to the Beloved of the world that thy letter reached the Most Great Paradise and whatsoever thou didst submit was adorned with truthfulness. The whole world hath been created for this Day and all are promised it in the divine Books. This blessed Day, the Day when “thy Lord shall come” hath been as the apple of the Qur’an’s eye, and “thy Lord shall come with angels rank on rank” is its heart. Nevertheless all remained veiled from it and heedless of it save whom thy Lord willeth. Moses came: “the idolaters denied Him.” The Spirit appeared: they turned away to such extent that God raised Him to heaven. The Beloved came: “the divines of that age denied Him.” By My life, that befell Him which cannot be mentioned in words. Consider briefly “there came not unto them any Messenger.” After pondering on what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, two stations and two matters become clear and evident. First, the station of God’s most great favor bestowed upon thee, that despite the heedlessness and ignorance of most of the servants, He enabled thee to attain this greatest bounty. And second, that the heedless ones - those souls who are oblivious of the Most Great Ocean and who cling to the chiefs of idle fancies - realize that in all ages such objections have been raised against the Manifestations of the Cause. Blessed art thou for having turned to My Self, drunk the choice wine of My love, spoken in remembrance and praise of Me, and desired to attain My presence, the Mighty, the Beloved. Henceforth be not grieved. The Cause hath been and shall ever be in God’s hands. If He willeth, He bestoweth the reward of attainment unto His presence. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. Today all must strive to teach the Cause. Blessed is the nightingale that announceth unto men My Revelation and My days and their turning unto My luminous horizon.</p>

Blessed is he who hath aimed for the Ultimate Goal and the Supreme Paradise, and who hath attained unto the presence and circumambulated it. Were all the seas of the world to become ink and all trees pens, they could not fulfill this remembrance. We beseech God to ordain for His loved ones who have held fast to His Book and are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness that which diffuseth the fragrance of generosity. One drop from the ocean of His bounty brought the world into being. His sea of bestowals hath no shore and the river of His mercy no end. The loved ones of Nun and Jim, as well as Kha and Vav, have all at this hour been illumined by the effulgent lights of the Day-Star of remembrance and utterance. Let that honored one mention all of them on behalf of this Wronged One and remind them. The missive of the known souls hath been accepted and adorned. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for His loved ones that which will draw them nigh unto Him and illumine them at all times with the lights of His knowledge. My God, my God! Thou seest those who have turned to Thee, yearning for Thy presence and to stand before Thy face, and those who remember Thee in their lands. O Lord! Ordain for each one of them what Thou hast ordained for the sincere among Thy servants and the near ones among Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. At this hour the Day-Star of permission hath risen from the horizon of will. Inform Janab-i-Kalb-’Ali that, God willing, with his gaze fixed upon the decree of wisdom and his trust placed in God, he may aim for the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>

<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</p>
<p>O seeker! The Wronged One turneth toward thee from the prison precinct and remembereth thee purely for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Wronged One calleth out in the prison and summoneth all to the Supreme Horizon, the Station wherein the Tree exclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.” That which was hidden in God’s knowledge and inscribed in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers hath been made manifest. This is the Day wherewith We previously gave glad tidings to the world, that He might lead forth the people from darkness into light and give them glad tidings of the days of God. Thus did the Tongue of Revelation speak aforetime and at this hour. Say: O peoples of the earth! By God, this is the Day whose mention was sent down in the Qur’an, the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest passion hold you back from the Lord of all creation. Cast away what ye possess and take what ye are bidden by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Say: This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him - to this testifieth every fair-minded, clear-sighted one. O peoples of the earth! The Self-Subsisting hath appeared and calleth out before all faces, offering the Sealed Wine, saying: Hasten, O people, then drink thereof in the name of your Lord, the Munificent Giver. We counsel all to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned, the mystics and the princes have slipped, save whom God willeth, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Soon will come unto you one who will hold you back from God and bid you to what he hath of the promptings of Satan. Thus do We inform you, when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq and in this remote prison. Be thankful unto thy Lord for having attained unto this Tablet whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the eternity of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Preserve this station in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, then remember Him at morn and eventide.</p>

<p>O ’Abdu’l-Husayn! Thy letter hath arrived and We have heard that which thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the Throne and the Owner of the Earth, the Sovereign of Destiny and Master of Decree. Blessed be thy tongue for having attained to the remembrance of God, the Lord of the kingdom of earth and heaven, and blessed be thine ear for having hearkened unto His call when it was raised from the realm of might, and happy be thy heart for having turned and thy face for having been directed.

I believed in Thee when I heard Thy call. I testify that Thy grace did encompass me, Thy mercy did precede me, Thy bounty did make me know Thee, and Thy loving-kindness did teach me. I beseech Thee, O Originator of all things and Sovereign over all names, by Thy perspicuous Book and Thy mighty News, to aid me to do what Thou lovest and approvest. Then ordain for me the good of this world and the next. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Throne and of the dust. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the loved ones and say: This Wronged One, Who hath become the object of the world’s hatred, maketh mention of you. The calumnies of the oppressors, the denial of the infidels, and the fire of the polytheists have not prevented the Tongue of Grandeur from remembrance.

We desire now to send down for thee that which shall cause thy mention to endure throughout the eternity of His names and attributes and the Kingdom of God, the Revealer of verses.

The evidences of thy Lord have encompassed the world. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe betide every heedless one who hath denied the proof of God, the Lord of lords. Thy letter hath reached the Wronged One. We have answered thee with this Tablet, at whose revelation the Bayan hath bowed down in submission. When thou attainest unto My Tablet and that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me with a remembrance through which the fragrances of Thy loving-kindness have been wafted amongst the religions. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee to remain steadfast in this great steadfastness and to ordain for thee that which shall draw thee nigh unto Him. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant who is called ’Ali-Qabli-Nabil turning unto Thee, clinging to Thy cord, and detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee to ordain for him that which shall exalt him through Thy name amongst Thy servants and in Thy service throughout Thy lands. I testify, O my God, that he hath believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and hath drunk the choice wine of faith from the cup of Thy bounty and the Kawthar of certitude from the hand of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to open before his face the doors of Thy mercy, Thy gifts and Thy favors, and to ordain for him that which shall profit him in every world of Thy worlds.

<p>O Qasim! The Truth speaketh in the tongue of every people, that all may comprehend that for which they were created. The Most Exalted Pen at times admonisheth, at times counseleth, and remembereth the events of the past, that all may become aware and not be afflicted anew with the vain imaginings of old. Reflect upon the Shi’ih sect and the pride and arrogance of those people. They regarded as unclean the Jews and Christians, and likewise the idol-worshippers and fire-worshippers. The People of the Sunna they deemed lower, more rejected and more abominable than all other sects. Yet on the Promised Day, with but a slight test, they were found to be the most lost of all upon the earth. They perpetrated that which no sect in all ages and centuries had ever committed. They cried “O Qa’im!” and then martyred Him, and now in all the pulpits and cities of Iran the ignorant divines and base theologians revile the Truth and His followers. All must ponder upon that which hath been mentioned, that perchance they may not be afflicted in the future with that which afflicted the former people. Praise be to the Aim of all the world Who hath remembered thee and caused thee to attain unto the evidences of the Most Exalted Pen. We make mention of thy brother, thy son-in-law and thy son with such remembrance as to attract the hearts and souls. We have remembered each one of them and We beseech God to grant them the grace to achieve the most great steadfastness and to remain unaffected by the cawing of the crows who speak the words of old and cling to the vain imaginings of the Shi’ih sect. God protect Us and you from the evil of such people. This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save Him. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto the heedless. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have attained and hearkened unto My call and have said: “Here am I! Here am I!

The purpose of God–glorified be His majesty–in creating the means of heaven and earth hath been the ease, comfort and progress of His servants. However, in most souls, tyranny and wickedness have overcome righteousness and piety, and kept them from drawing nigh unto God.

Heedlessness hath so seized them that they are held back from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all mankind. They have followed their own desires and taken them as lords besides God.

We make mention of thy sister and give her the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness and remind her of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the grace of her Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to God, they have turned and attained unto the revelations of the Most Exalted Pen. All that is witnessed today shall return to nothingness, and these verses are recorded and inscribed in the Mother Book. Extinction shall not overtake it, nor shall centuries and ages alter it. All this is from the grace of God, your Lord and the Lord of your forebears. The Glory be upon you both from God, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>Tablet to the wife of Ali-Qabel-Akbar, upon her be the Glory of God</p>
<p>In the Name of the One God</p>
<p>O my leaf! Upon thee be My glory and favor! Thou hast ever been and art remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. Praise be to the Goal of the world that thou dwellest in a house from which the mention of God is raised, and art related to one who from the earliest days hath spoken in remembrance of God and arisen to serve His Cause. Know thou the station of this bounty. All the world and its servants and handmaidens have been brought from nothingness into being specifically for the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Now the queens of the world turn in remembrance of God to temples, churches and mosques, and engage in mention and prayer with the utmost humility and submissiveness; nevertheless they are deprived of the fragrance of the garment of His Revelation and forbidden from the shore of the sea of nearness and reunion. But thee hath He guided through His grace and shown the way. Thou hast attained to that which was the purpose of creation.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I am Thy handmaiden and the daughter of Thy handmaiden. I testify to Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty, to Thy might and Thy power and Thy grandeur, and that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been the Protector of Thy servants and handmaidens, and powerful over all who dwell in Thy earth and heaven. I beseech Thee by Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things, and by Thy grace which hath encompassed all contingent beings, and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and by the lights of Thy countenance, to make me in all conditions turn toward Thy most exalted horizon and hold fast to the cord of Thy favor, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! Then I beseech Thee to ordain for me the good of this world and the next, and that which befitteth the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bounty, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of gifts and bestowals. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. And praise be unto Thee, for verily Thou art the Goal of them that know.</p>

<p>O precious leaf, handmaiden, upon thee be the Glory of God! In the name of the Beloved of the world! O my leaf, O my handmaiden! Upon thee be My glory! Praise be to God that thou hast been assisted to turn, acknowledge and confess that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Today, whosoever hath turned to the Most Exalted Horizon is recorded and inscribed before God as one of the people of true divine unity, for this blessed Day is associated with God alone and in the books of the past and future is designated and known as the Day of God. The whole world was created for the recognition of this Most Great Cause, but the recompense of their deeds prevented and deprived all except those souls whom the hand of power took hold of and delivered from the darkness of self and passion. If thou were to praise and glorify God, exalted be His glory, with all thy members, limbs, veins and hair until the Day that hath no end, it would assuredly be as mere nothingness compared to this most great bounty. If wisdom requireth and it doth not conflict with prudence, there is no objection to turning toward the prison. We beseech God to assist thee, preserve thee, and grant thee the bounty of His presence and ordain for thee its reward. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, and He is powerful over all things. Thy pen reached Us and was honored with acceptance and was blessed by the finger of thy Lord’s power. The water of life hath flowed from it - rejoice thou, for thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thy intention was made manifest in the Most Holy Court and appeared in the form of that very pen which thou didst intend. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth and changeth one thing for another, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who hath believed and remained steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>My tongue, my heart, my pen and my limbs testify to the oneness and singleness of God, and that He is the One who has power over whatsoever He willeth. The conditions of the world cannot frustrate Him, nor can the doubts of the nations. There hath shone forth from His most exalted horizon a brilliant light, a pervading fragrance, an articulate tongue, and a commanding Cause. Through His might, power and sovereignty He hath manifested whatsoever He desired in such wise that neither the might of princes nor the opposition of divines - who broke God’s covenant and His testament and caused their people to enter the abode of perdition - could prevent it.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Subduer of the world and Benefactor of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Ark of Thy Cause which sailed upon the sea of names through Thy will and power, to aid Thy male and female servants who have aimed for the ultimate goal and the supreme height to remain steadfast in Thy love and in the exaltation of Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Thou seest and hearest that one of Thy Afnans hath mentioned one of Thy handmaidens and testified to her acceptance and her turning unto Thee. I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of the names to accept from her what she intended in Thy days and sent forth as evidence of her adherence to Thy commandments and ordinances. O my Lord! Forgive her and purify her through Thy grace and favor, then send down upon her at all times that which will make her steadfast in Thy Cause - that which was named in the Furqan as the Great Announcement and in the books of old by that which caused the teeth of the monotheists to gleam with joy. There is no God but Thee, the Hearer, the Answerer, and worthy of answering prayers.</p>
<p>The remittance of Amatu’llah Fatimih Bibi, upon her be the Glory of God, in the amount of eighty tumans, was received by the servant in the prison through the honored Afnan T.Q., upon him be, from all Glory, its most glorious portion, during the month of Sha’ban the Great in the year 1303.</p>

The Light is shining, the Fire is blazing, the Ocean is surging, the Atmosphere is adorned. We beseech God to grant strength unto man and to increase his vision, that all may behold with their own eyes and become aware. O Taj’d-Din! Praise be to God that thy head hath been adorned with the crown of divine recognition. Thou didst purpose to reach the true Ka’bih and didst attain to His presence, and from the hand of bounty thou didst drink the cup of meeting. All this is from God’s grace upon thee. Verily, My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to thy turning toward the horizon of light, thy orientation toward the Countenance, thy standing before the Gate, and thy hearkening unto the Call of Him Who conversed on Sinai when He was established upon the throne of Revelation. Thy Lord is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous One. He preserveth the recompense of His servants’ deeds in the treasuries of His protection and manifesteth unto them His grace and His mercy. He is the All-Forgiving, the Generous. There is none other God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee to guide the servants and to make mention of Him throughout the lands. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land and illumine them with the splendors of the light of divine providence. Verily, He is with His loved ones, He heareth and seeth their deeds and whatsoever their tongues do utter. He is the Hearing, the Answering One. In this day, unity and harmony are accounted before the Throne as the most excellent of all deeds. Blessed are they who occupy themselves with bringing hearts and souls together. They are of the people of Baha, to which the Kingdom of Utterance in this exalted station doth testify. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whosoever hath heard the Call from the Most Exalted Horizon and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth!”</p>

<p>You had previously attained to the mention of God, glorified be His majesty, and now My servant Asdaq, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, hath mentioned thee in the Most Great Prison, and this most mighty, most holy Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will […] that thou mayest inhale its fragrance and partake of the true heavenly food. Praise be to God that neither the overwhelming power of the oppressors nor the clamor of the barking ones prevented thee from the Most Exalted Horizon or deprived thee of the Most Great Ocean. The divines, mystics and jurists of the earth, by night and by day, beseeched God, glorified be His majesty, for the meeting with His Manifestation and Speaker. Yet when the ocean of hope surged and the horizon of divine purpose dawned forth, all turned away - especially the Shi’ih sect who, with their tongues, uttered curses and, with their pens, issued verdicts for the shedding of His most pure blood, and with their hands wrought that which causeth the company of the Prophets and the chosen ones in the most exalted paradise and supreme station to weep and lament. The faithful and steadfast must know their station and at all times give voice to praise and thanksgiving, for He hath confirmed them, guided them and bestowed upon them that which hath no likeness or peer - and that is the recognition of that sanctified Being on the Day of His manifestation. Thy call, from beginning to end, hath attained unto the honor of being heard. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath fulfilled God’s Covenant and His Pledge. Woe unto every heedless and remote one. We convey Our greetings to the loved ones in that land and give them the glad-tidings of His loving-kindness. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of earth and heaven, that there is none other God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

The glory be upon thee from Us and upon them that love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. From the most eloquent tongue We turn to the tongue of light. The one named Jud came into the presence of the Wronged One and made mention of thee, beseeching Our favor. We said: “Praise be to God, they have attained unto His grace and are nourished by the fruits of the divine Lote-Tree. From the beginning of days until now they have been engaged in praise and thanksgiving and in service.” In response he mentioned the waves of the ocean of bounty and the lights of the supreme horizon at every moment are beloved, for souls are bound to them and hearts and minds are illumined and refreshed thereby. After these utterances this Tablet was sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all men, that the Afnan might in every moment drink of the Kawthar of utterance from the words of the Lord of Names. This Kawthar bestows true joy and grants eternal life. The reward of thy deeds is remembered and treasured with God and inscribed in the Crimson Book. We praise God Who hath aided thee and enabled thee to recognize Him and to stand firm in His Cause and in His service, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.

<p>He is the Living One! If thou art the Sun of the world, where is the radiance of thy joyous lights? And if thou art the Moon of paradise, where is the brilliance of thy sacred mysteries? And if thou art of the secluded maidens in the pavilions of divine unity, where is thy rapture and yearning? And if thou art of the countenance-bearers in the tabernacles of lordship, where is thy ecstasy and delight? After all, every station must have its sign, and every rank must have its token. The musk of divine unity without its heart-attracting fragrances cannot be known, and the perfume from the Sheba of eternality without its heart-pleasing breezes can avail nothing. If form without meaning is desired, there are many Indian portraits, and in Baghdad their pages are sold in the auction market for less than a tenth of a dinar. But if meaning is sought and intended, it must have manifestation and appearance, that the north winds of the holy cloud-heaven might take their portion from the curling locks of hair, and the precious curls of mighty radiance might receive their share from the perfumed fragrance of its glory. This is the station of abstract essences and holy realities. A parrot without speech appears less than a sparrow, and the sun without light and splendor is surely lower than an atom. Make straight the foot of love that thou mayest raise high the head of glory. Draw the pen of nothingness across the luminous tablet of the heart that thou mayest plant the banner of existence above the mountain of power. But all this is from God’s grace, which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. Other than the pure existence hath no portion of this bounty, and none but the essence of souls hath any share from this fountain. And verily He is the Bestower of whatsoever He willeth upon whomsoever He willeth.

Verily He giveth what He pleaseth unto whom He pleaseth, and ordaineth what He willeth for whomsoever He desireth, through His all-pervading grace.

Many are those who verbally acknowledge the appearance of Truth and His power, yet since they have not held fast to the deeds that were revealed in God’s Book, they have become the cause of delay for the people of earth. God willing, all must act in a manner befitting the days of God. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by My Pen and for having attained to My remembrance and praise. Know thou this glorious and exalted station. O servant of God! When the heart is illumined with the lights of divine knowledge, wherever thou dwellest thou shalt abide beneath His mercy. Rejoice in thy Lord’s favor and be of the thankful ones. The occupation that is beloved in the sight of God is engagement in crafts and professions. However, if someone is employed in service to the government for the protection of His Cause or for serving the loved ones of God, there is and has been no objection. And if the rulers of the earth were to attain to the lights of divine knowledge, such souls would be like unto stars. We beseech God to assist all to recognize the Manifestation of His Cause. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. As for what thou hast written regarding remembrance - read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. Whatsoever hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen is a lamp for the guidance of the servants and a guide and teacher for those in all lands. The recitation of any of these will be beloved and will become the cause and means of the outpourings of the Lord of all being.</p>

<p>O Mirza Isma’il, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Today is the day of the blessed word “We have recorded all things in a Book.” O Isma’il! It is hoped that you will manifest the detachment of Khalil (Abraham) and hold fast to the Mother Book. When he was suspended in the air, Gabriel the Trusted One came and said: “Have you any need?” He replied: “Not of you.” Through these words, the fragrance of detachment has encompassed the world. May the spirit of the world be a sacrifice to his detachment!</p>
<p>Today the Supreme Pen speaks in wondrous and sublime melodies. In the first station and primary rank it has been expressed as the trumpet blast: “And We breathed into it by Our command; thereupon all who are in earth and heaven swooned away, save those whom We preserved through Our Name, the Savior, and through Our Name, the Gracious.”</p>
<p>Be not grieved by the tyranny of oppressors and the injustice of aggressors. The world has been set in motion by the Word of God and all directions have been perfumed by its fragrances. Say: O people of the schools, deprive not yourselves! O people of the churches, withhold not yourselves! Turn with radiant faces and illumined hearts, that you may attain to the good-pleasure of God and be freed and detached from the world and all that is therein.</p>
<p>This Wronged One, while swimming in the ocean of sorrows, made mention of His loved ones. In the letter to His Majesty the King of Iran, these words were revealed: “I walk, advancing toward the Mighty, the Bestower, while behind Me flow the oceans. Should anyone ask thee about Baha, say: He is in the hands of the wicked ones.” When thou dost catch the fragrance of God’s utterance, arise from thy place, turn toward the Kaaba of existence and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy verses and the pearls hidden in the ocean of Thy bounty to make me detached from all else but Thee, speaking in Thy praise and standing firm in Thy service. Verily Thou art the Mighty, Thou art the All-Bountiful, there is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Generous.”</p>

<p>Today the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree is ablaze and the light of oneness is shining and manifest from the horizon of the Lord’s will. How blessed is the soul that has perceived the straight path through that light and has attained to divine love through the heat of that fire. Whosoever today turns toward the true Kaaba is reckoned among the gems of existence before the Worshipped One, and others are counted as turning away. Verily I say, today is the day of remembrance and praise, the day of goodly words and pleasing deeds. Strive that perchance ye may attain to God’s enduring bounty. The most excellent of deeds today is steadfastness, for the cawers and the liars and the infidels have appeared and will appear in every land, even as was revealed aforetime by the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they that know and blessed are they who drink the wine of steadfastness in this mighty Cause. The cawers are souls who speak without divine permission and who deviate from the straight path of servitude. God willing, all the friends must at all times speak in remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds and hold fast to the strong cord of steadfastness. This is the most great bounty, to which this trustworthy Pen doth testify. Give thanks unto God for having attained unto this Tablet and for being mentioned before the Wronged One in this mighty prison. The loved ones of that land who have drunk from the Kawthar of recognition and who gaze toward the horizon of the Cause are all remembered in the Most Holy Court. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the Remembering, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Abu-Talib! Hearken unto the call of the Desired One, then know that which He counseleth thee. He commandeth thee only to that which is better for thee than whatsoever hath been created upon earth, wert thou of them that know. First, associate not any partner with God, nor join with Him anyone besides Him. Then let God suffice thee against all the worlds. Verily, He is with thee in all conditions and will aid thee in whatsoever thou desirest in His path, and will send down unto thee that which He hath ordained for thee in the preserved Tablets of might. Say: O people! Associate not partners with God, for verily association is a grievous wrong - even should all who are in the heavens and earth oppose thee in this, shun them and turn thy face toward thy Lord, the One, the Peerless. Say: Should He so desire, He would cause the tongues of all created things to sing His praise. He verily doeth what He willeth. He hath ever been One in His Essence, having taken neither partner nor peer unto Himself. Leave the associators behind thee and hold fast to the hem of ancient glory. Say: O people! Fear ye God and associate not partners with Him Who hath ever been sanctified above all likeness and similitude. His is the most sublime similitude, yet similitude is but His proof and evidence unto the worlds. By God! Nothing that proceedeth from Him hath any likeness - how much less His own Self, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Be thou assured by the grace of thy Lord - His grace is ever nigh unto thee. Grieve not at afflictions, for He transformeth them as He pleaseth by His command. He verily is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Associate with people in wisdom, then seek for thyself a path on the straight way. And the Glory be upon thee and upon those who have detached themselves unto God, the King, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>Revealed for Shaykh ’Abdu’l-Husayn: Verily He is ever watchful. O Husayn! You visit Husayn yet kill Husayn. O heedless doubter! We desired your presence in Iraq and left the choice to you to appear in whatever place you wished, that We might show you the proof. You accepted, but when the appointed time came, the winds blew and you fled, O fly! We came to a house where the meeting was arranged, but We found you not, O you who associate partners with God, the Sender of winds! When you saw your own powerlessness, you made excuses, O deceiver! We desired to meet you only that God’s proof might be completed against you and those around you, that perchance the fire of hatred might be stilled in your breast and in the breasts of those who have denied the Lord of Lords. You turned away from meeting Me, though the dwellers of Paradise and the inmates of the holy retreats long for it. Soon you shall weep and lament and shall find no escape. Wait until God brings His punishment upon you from His presence. Soon shall the breezes of chastisement seize you and return you to the fires. The All-Merciful has come in the shadows of utterance, and sovereignty belongs to God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling. The wine of passion and desire has intoxicated the dwellers in the wilderness of self and desire, while the sincere have turned with spirit and fragrance to the Dawning-Place of Revelation. The Decisive Word has come, and for the idolaters there is no abode save hell - an evil dwelling place indeed. Tribulations shall not prevent Us from mentioning the Lord of Names. I summon the people as commanded, and neither the turning away of all on earth nor the might of any proud oppressor shall prevent Me. God has made tribulations like the spring breezes to this Tree which has been raised up in truth, and every leaf thereof proclaims: Sovereignty belongs to God, the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Soon shall death come upon you and you shall see the punishment of your Lord, O you who have turned away from Him by Whom the promise was fulfilled and the Herald has called aloud.</p>

<p>In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O thou who dyest in the divine cloud! Dye all created things with this dye which hath appeared on the horizons, that they may be dyed with the dye of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all creation. His dye is to purify the soul from all colors, and whoso attaineth unto this hath indeed attained unto the dye of God and is numbered among the successful ones in the preserved Tablets. Beware, beware lest thou dye thyself with the dye of allusions from those who make claims. Purify thyself from these, and if thou art able, cause all created things to enter the vats of the dye of My power, that they may all appear in the color of My love - and this is indeed a mighty favor.</p>
<p>Empty thy spirit of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, then thy heart of those who have warred against the Self of God that standeth over all things. Then turn thy face toward the quarter that shineth with truth. Beware lest thou forget thy Lord, for We have not forgotten thee and have remembered thee in this Tablet which verily shineth with truth.</p>
<p>Preserve the verses of thy Lord, then recite them that thou mayest be reminded of the remembrance of this solitary, lonely Prisoner Who hath been imprisoned in the prison of destiny, and beyond the prison the idolaters have cast Him into the depths of the pit of darkness. None hath comprehended Him, His Self, and what hath befallen Him save He Who created Him in truth, raised Him up through grace, and sent Him forth with justice unto all who are in the worlds.</p>
<p>Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth and sent from the quarter of loving-kindness the holy and beloved fragrances, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and give thanks unto God thy Lord and be numbered among the thankful ones in the mighty and glorious Tablets. And glory be upon thee and upon all who have believed in God and turned away from all else, whether small or great.</p>

Hearken unto the Call from the Dawning-Place of grandeur and glory - verily there is no God but I, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Power hath been manifested, for the Chosen One hath come with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things, yet most people understand not. When the Hour appeared, all creatures were shaken - among them are those who see but recognize not, those who hear but believe not, and those who have attained the lights of Beauty and found the fragrance of reunion - these indeed are among the God-fearing ones amidst humanity, to which the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Beloved, doth testify. Blessed art thou for having turned unto God and for not being hindered by the vain imaginings of those who disputed the signs and proof of God, until they imprisoned the Dawning-Place of verses in this forbidden fortress. Soon shall they find their deeds when the hand of thy Lord’s power shall seize them - this is a promise that shall not prove false. Thy mention hath been made before the One Who is Mentioned, and this Tablet hath been sent down unto thee, wherewith nothing that was or will be can compare. When the Supreme Pen moved to thy remembrance, the ocean of thy Lord’s forgiveness surged as a favor from Him unto thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the seen and unseen! Thou hast purified me from all sins and ordained for me and my descendants what Thou hast willed in a preserved Tablet. Grieve not at anything, but trust in Him in all conditions. Say: O people! By God, the Most Great Luminary hath appeared and through Him the heavens and earth have been illumined. Beware lest veils prevent you from your ultimate goal and the words of those who have followed every heedless rejected one disturb you. Thus have We illumined thy heart with the lights of remembrance and utterance, and offered unto thy heart from Our sealed wine. Drink thou in My Name and through My sovereignty, and glorify before the faces of My loved ones who are with thee - these indeed are they who have attained.</p>

Drink thou again and again, by this Name that overshadoweth the worlds. Thy letter hath come before the Countenance and hath won the lights of the Throne.

I counsel thee to achieve complete detachment and pure fear of God, and to gird up thy loins in this land for the sake of God thy Lord, and to close thine eyes to all else besides Him, such that thou takest not a step except by His leave, nor turnest thy gaze save with His good-pleasure. Aid thy Lord through all thy deeds and conditions, and be not heedless of Him in any moment or instance. Forget thyself but forget not thy Lord; pass beyond thy spirit but pass not beyond the remembrance of thy Creator.

Set not thy foot save in the footsteps of My feet, and be unto others as thou art unto thyself. Then remind the servants of all that thou hast witnessed in this journey of thine, without addition or diminution, following the straight and upright path. Then make mention of My exile, then My distress, then My poverty and need, then My arrival in a land wherein no voice can be raised from Us and wherein none can hear My cry and lamentation. This is what I desired from God, My Lord, from the intensity of tribulations which descended upon Us through that which the hands of those who love and hate Us have wrought. And God knoweth that which no one else knoweth. By God! Were My liver and heart to be revealed unto thee, thou wouldst find them pierced by the arrows that have struck and befallen them. Yet in all this, and for all that hath come to pass or will come to pass, We render thanks unto God. We beseech God to aid thee in the Cause of thy Lord and to make thee one of those who are guided.</p>

God willing, may the friends of God be illumined by the light of His Cause and be set ablaze with the fire of the blessed Tree - a blazing that will seize the world of existence and guide to the ocean of manifestation. This Day is the Day of God wherein hath appeared that which had never appeared before. To this testifeth every fair-minded and discerning one, every knowing and informed one. The purpose of this Wronged One is to illumine the world with the light of unity and to transform the enmity and hatred between the various peoples into love and concord. We have obliterated from the Book strife and corruption, conflict and warfare and the like, and have enjoined upon all that which is praiseworthy. Well is it with them that act accordingly. The wrongdoers, however, have changed what is praiseworthy into that which is blameworthy and have concealed the virtues of this Revelation behind the veils of self and passion. But God will manifest that which He willeth. He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. You must, under all conditions, be occupied with the remembrance of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of Thy utterance in Thy days and for having made me to know the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens. I beseech Thee by Thy most sweet call which was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and by Thy bounty which hath encompassed all existence, and by the light of Thy Cause whereby both the unseen and the visible have been illumined, to make me well-pleased with Thy good-pleasure, willing that which Thou willest, steadfast in Thy service, and speaking Thy praise amongst Thy servants. Thou art He Whose will and mercy have preceded all things, and Whose grandeur and power have encompassed all things. Thou ordainest as Thou pleasest. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the All-Potent. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon those who have turned towards the straight path of God and His momentous and most great announcement.</p>

This is a Day wherein the Word sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful Will hath encompassed all things. Some, upon hearing the Word, have turned to the Most Great Horizon more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, while others, through their vain desires and imaginary veils, have remained deprived of the court of oneness. Therefore must the sincere servants rend asunder these veils with the finger of certitude, that all may attain to the outpourings of the True Bestower. Some servants who have been debarred from the Most Great Ocean and deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of Bounty and the heaven of generosity - this is because they have had and continue to have no knowledge of the Cause. The loved ones of God must in this spiritual dawn be occupied with guiding souls - that is, they must, through the Kawthar of wisdom and utterance, quicken the dead and revive the withered ones. By the Sun of Truth! This eternal Kawthar bestoweth light upon the corrupted sense, granteth the spirit of bounty to the lifeless frame; through it, the hesitant one hasteneth forward and the sluggish one taketh wing. We beseech God to aid, through His special grace, the servants of His Cause, that they may arise with complete dedication to serve Him and be occupied with His remembrance.

In truth were that lofty and glorious station to be revealed to an extent smaller than a needle’s eye before the eyes of them that dwell on earth, they would, one and all, be so filled with joy and ecstasy as to be consumed thereby. Therefore think not that he hath perished. Indeed he will endure in the heavenly kingdom as long as God Himself endureth. And this calleth for gratitude, not grieving. When he findeth that thou art happy he becometh more cheerful, but when he perceiveth that thou art disconsolate, this provoketh anguish in his heart.</p>
<p>Busy thyself in the remembrance of God and unloose thy tongue in celebrating His praise with utmost joy and radiance. God, the Exalted, the True, is with thee. He is kinder than a father and more compassionate than a son.</p>
<p>Call thou to mind the episode of the land of ?af, when a mother sent forth her son who laid down his life in the path of the Beloved. This Day is the king of days. It behoveth thee to show forth such deeds as will distinguish thee from the women of a bygone age. Such beseemeth the servants and maid-servants of God. Be thou resigned to His good pleasure and seek communion with Him.</p>
<p>At this moment the entire company of the Concourse on high are engaged in extolling the virtues of thy son and in acclaiming his attributes. If thou couldst hear, thou wouldst, in thy longing, wing thy flight unto God, the Incomparable, the All-Informed. The day is not far distant when all the dwellers of the earth will magnify his praise and seek blessings from his dust. Verily incalculable is the bounty of thy Lord. Seize thy chance and be of them that endure with patience.</p>

<p>O my sister, upon whom be the Glory of God! In the name of the Beloved Friend! O blessed and goodly leaf! If you ask about the body, it is in utmost hardship and tribulation. If you ask about the physical frame, it is afflicted with countless trials. And if you ask about the spirit, it is in the heights of joy and delight. In the path of God, I have never complained of tribulation. Rather, in the love of the All-Merciful, I have grown accustomed to trials and afflictions just as an infant is accustomed to its mother’s breast. Yet what benefit is there while life remains and the cup of martyrdom in God’s path remains untasted, though in every moment I attain to a martyrdom. Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds that despite all these hardships and tribulations, we are occupied with the remembrance of the Friend and detached from all else. The world has no permanence that one should attach one’s heart to it or be saddened by its events. Soon all will perish and pass away, and what has been and ever shall be is God, mighty be His glory and exalted be His station. Consider affliction in His path as mercy, and tribulation in His way as blessing. In all that we have borne there lies hidden a wisdom that none knoweth save God. You have always been and will continue to be in my thoughts. Hold fast to truth and turn away from all else. Praise God that the tie of kinship has not been severed and that you dwell secure and at rest beneath the divine Lote-Tree. This is a blessing that is great in the sight of God. The reward of every deed is treasured in the repositories of immunity, and when the time comes it will be manifested in most beauteous array. Verily thy Lord will fully recompense the sincere among His handmaidens and His sincere servants. Convey my greetings and praise to those who dwell round about, and the Glory be upon thee and upon those with thee.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, son of Ahmad, upon both of you be the glory of God, He Who is established upon the throne of Revelation! In these days the mystery of what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an is made manifest, His blessed and exalted Word: “Though it be but the weight of a mustard seed and though it be hidden in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring it to light.” The tongue of grandeur in the kingdom of power speaks this most exalted word: “The Day has come and that which was hidden in the hearts of the people has appeared.” It is the Day whereon the secrets shall be searched out. The hidden things of the breasts and the treachery of the eyes are manifest and evident. Perfect bounty was shown toward Satan from the divine ocean of grace and celestial generosity, to such extent that he counted himself nearer than the denizens of the Kingdom, and afterward appeared that which you have heard. The new heedless one united with his like, and for wealth they disregarded the ultimate end. They changed God’s religion for gold. In the Hidden Words We said: “O Son of Being! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test the gold, and with gold We test Our servants.” On the day of reckoning they were occupied with riches and remained heedless and veiled from the wealthy and self-subsisting Lord. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My days, heard My call, turned toward My countenance and taken My Book through the grace of God, the Lord of the worlds. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto His days, His recognition, His presence and His meeting. This is a great bounty from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Grieve not over anything. You are in the fortress of My protection and under the shadow of My grace. Rejoice in this supreme bounty and say: Unto Thee be praise and glory and thanks and bounty, there is no God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous. The glory from Us be upon you and upon your first and your last, and your outward and your inward.</p>

All things give you glad tidings of divine favor and the infinite outpourings of the Lord. Praise be to God that you have attained to that which the Truth Himself has borne. For four months this Wronged One was afflicted in the Land of Ta with imprisonment, chains, fetters and the taunts of enemies.

<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! God, exalted be His glory, has been with you in all conditions. Whatever befell you has been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in God’s Book. Soon shall you witness that which has been ordained specially for His loved ones. Strive that no word proceed from you that would prevent the outpourings. Preserve your stations through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. By the Kingdom of Utterance, great profit lies with you. God is awake and aware. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. That which befell you - its stations are a treasure from you stored in the treasury of the one true Goal, and He is trustworthy and hath ever loved and loveth trustworthiness. Rejoice in what the Tongue of Grandeur hath given you glad tidings of at this moment, and say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Glory be upon you, upon your first and your last, upon those with you, those who aided you, and those who heard and responded to you.

<p>In the Name of the peerless Lord! That which is, in the first instance, conducive to the order of the world and the progress of nations has been and will continue to be the Most Great Peace, the particulars of which have been recorded in the sacred Scriptures and Tablets. God willing, in the City of Justice the kings shall assemble to consult regarding this Most Great Peace, and shall carry out that which hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen. In this way shall the world find tranquility and they themselves find rest. That which is the cause and means of the progress of government and nation is what hath been mentioned. However, hearing ears and penetrating vision are needed, that they may see and hear. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, through the steadfastness and orientation of His trusted ones and chosen ones, will raise up a people who will take heed and arise for the reformation of the world. Strange it is that the Supreme Pen hath at all times been occupied with loving counsels and still is. In days when the arrows of tribulation were moving and descending from the clouds of hatred like rain, We mentioned the Word of Truth and guided the people to the straight path. Nevertheless, no trace of it appeared in them. We found them struck down as though they were hollow palm-trunks. God willing, may ye be illumined by the light of the utterance of the All-Merciful and arise to serve His Cause. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Word of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and hath arisen to aid the Cause through teaching, which is recorded in My Preserved Tablet. O people of Baha! Withhold not the pearls of knowledge from others. Through wisdom and utterance, present these precious pearls before the eyes of the people. Perchance an eye may be found that will turn to the Most Sublime Vision. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>

Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the direction of the Throne, the station round which circle the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and then the dwellers of the cities of Names. Verily, there is no God but I, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: O people! Do ye behold for your Lord, the All-Merciful, any partner in sovereignty? Nay, by My radiant and luminous Beauty! And do ye see for Him any minister? Nay, by His Self, the Truth, if ye be of them that know! Can anyone be associated with Him? Nay, by my Lord! Blessed is he who draweth nigh unto My Great Name. They who see for Him a peer, these are in manifest veil. Their wretchedness hath overcome them; they are of an evil people, the most lost. By God! The Lord of Power hath appeared with His most great sovereignty, and nothing in the heavens or on earth can withhold Him from that which He hath created. He sendeth down what He willeth by His command, and decreeth what He pleaseth. O servant! Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as will shake the pillars of them who have denied the Day of Judgment. By your firmness shall the mountains of idle fancies be leveled, the barren lands shall be cleft asunder, and the hearts of the idolaters shall quake. And by your ascension to the Most Glorious Horizon shall the limbs of the doubters be frozen. Beware lest anything prevent thee from that which hath been revealed in truth. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We have created all things for Our remembrance and have explained every wise matter. Be thou a herald of this Name, that perchance by thy call he who is heedless may turn unto his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Be silent for God’s sake, speak for God’s sake, act for God’s sake, detached from all else besides Him. Thus have We taught thee and commanded thee as a favor from Us.

Rend asunder the veils through the power of the name of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. They who have removed themselves from the ocean of nearness are indeed in manifest error. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh unto God and drunk the wine of reunion from the countenance of his Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Grieve not at anything, but remain steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. He is with His servants who are firmly rooted. Aid thou the All-Merciful Who hath come from the heaven of utterance - this behooveth everyone who hath held fast to this mighty cord. Say: O people of Baha!

<p>These are the verses of God which have verily been sent down in truth. Blessed is the soul that hath been attracted by their fragrances. At times they appear in the form of the sun and shine forth from the horizon of eternity - how excellent is he who hath been illumined by their lights! And at times they appear in the form of clouds, from which the drops of inner meanings and utterance distill - blessed is he upon whom their rains have fallen! And at times they appear in human form, and verily this is the Most Great Word from the All-Merciful unto the peoples of all worlds. It singeth upon the branches of the Tree of Eternity that there is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Blessed is he who hath been attracted by its melodies. Say: The Tree of Sinai hath been raised up in the holy wilderness and hath yielded the fruits of divine companionship. Happy the soul that hath tasted of its fruits, while its leaves proclaim that there is none other God but Him. This indeed is the Sun that hath shone forth from the horizon of grace - turn ye, O people, unto its radiance. Say: The oceans of knowledge have surged and the clouds of destiny have been cleft asunder. God hath come with the hosts of the unseen, and the Supreme Pen hath inscribed upon the tablets of divine decree the mysteries of His Cause. Ponder, O people, upon their significance. Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as thou hast drunk of the most pure wine. Look, then, with the greatest vision. By the Beloved God! The Cause hath been exalted and made manifest. Blessed the soul that hath fulfilled its covenant. Leave behind what thou hast and take what thy Lord hath - this is better for thee than all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth and whatsoever hath been treasured in their ranges. Be thou steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, and shun those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Purify thy face for God, thy Lord, in these days wherein every soul hath come with its book. And glory be upon thee and upon them who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness and holiness and reunion, and have become detached from the world and its ornaments.</p>

O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him whose name was mentioned before the Throne, that he may arise to aid the Cause and assist his Lord through utterance. Blessed is thy brother, who remained faithful to the Covenant until he ascended unto the Most Glorious Companion.

I testify that thou didst cast away what was with the people and didst take what was sent unto thee from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Thou art he who attained the presence of God before the Manifestation, and when the Call was raised thou didst respond, saying: “Here am I, O God of all who are in earth and heaven!” Thou art among those who rent asunder the veils when the Bestower came in the shadows of the clouds. Blessed is he who visiteth thee after thy ascension and remembereth thee purely for the sake of thy Lord. He, verily, is among the righteous. Thus have We commanded thee in truth. Act thou according to that which thou hast been commanded by the Lord of the Day of Reckoning.</p>

<p>With brief mention and abundant sincerity, this one makes manifest that whatever expression of sincerity is made and whatever elucidation of special connection is offered exceeds description and utterance and is sanctified above characterization and explanation. Yet whatever is presented, as befits His station in that exalted court, would not be worthy. Therefore, these few passages will suffice, and in the station of love and condition of affection, these two or three verses bear witness:</p>
<p>Whatever brings thee joy in this world,</p>
<p>Think thou upon its separation at that time.</p>
<p>Many were gladdened by that which gladdens thee,</p>
<p>But in the end fled from it like the wind.</p>
<p>Therefore flee thou from it ere it flees from thee,</p>
<p>Set not thy heart upon it ere it parts from thee.</p>
<p>Therefore, We have likewise given tranquility and repose to that land of sincerity with the water We sent down from heaven, according to what God wishes and how He desires. Furthermore, it is submitted that an indication was made in the course of a tradition that there would be cause for a meeting. Yes, thus are We longing for it, but soon our appointed time will come, God willing, from God’s presence and the day of our return to God, until the believers are gathered together. Thus do We connect with thee and then shall We meet you in the presence of the Most High Sovereign. And greetings upon the sincere loved ones. To Jinab-i-Mirza Habibullah I send greetings. For Jinab-i-Ha Maqsud I long with perfect sincerity and complete eagerness and special connection, and send greetings.

Then He speaks forth with the Most Exalted Word: whosoever attains to recognition is accounted among the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise. Today the kinship of God is accepted and beloved. Whosoever acquires nobility from this most exalted station and most glorious rank has attained to that which was ordained in God’s Book for His loved ones.

The remembrance of God unto His servant Javad, that he may rejoice in His remembrance, for verily His remembrance of him is better for him than all that hath been created in the heavens and on earth. O Javad! Hearken unto My call, then soar in the atmosphere of My love, then turn away from thine own self in My path and hold fast unto My strong and mighty cord in such wise that the winds of hypocrisy from the people of dissension - they who have broken the Covenant and denied the lights of the Daystar of the horizons and were among the wrongdoers - shall not cause thee to waver. And when the Ancient Beauty walketh before their faces, they look upon Him with disdain. Thus hath Satan whispered in their breasts and made them to be numbered with the idolaters. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord in such wise that neither the tempests of trials nor the storms of tribulation shall move thee. Thus behooveth it him who hath believed in God, the Most High, the Most Great. Remember thy Lord amongst His servants and be not of the heedless ones. We have not forgotten thee, and thou shalt not forget thy Lord, and be thou of them that remember. Shun Mine enemies and turn thy heart toward My luminous countenance. Say: O people! Through Him have I become independent of all else save Him, and detached from the worlds. And thou art of those who attained the presence of the Youth in days when He was alone in the land of exile and had no one with whom to find solace, and God is witness and all-knowing of this. And thou wast the second one to attain His presence, and by this was thy name inscribed in the Tablets by the Pen of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and He hath ordained for thee a glorious and lofty station. Beware lest thou deprive thyself thereof. Be steadfast in His love, then walk among the people in My footsteps that there may be manifested from thee that which thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, doth love. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the King, the Mighty, the Peerless.</p>

The remembrance of God unto His servant, that he may rejoice in His remembrance of him, be detached from all the worlds, turn with his heart unto God and remember Him at morn and eventide. O servant! Blessed art thou in that thou hast drawn nigh unto God, thy Lord, attained His presence, and been honored to meet Him. This, verily, is a mighty triumph. Beware lest thou forget what thou hast heard from the tongue of God. Preserve it as thou wouldst preserve thine eye. Thus art thou commanded by One Who is knowing, wise. O servant! Be steadfast in the Cause of God, thy Lord, and follow not those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were doubtful of the Cause. Purify thy heart from all allusions, then walk in the path of those who have detached themselves from all save God and turned wholly unto the Almighty, the Powerful. Those who have removed themselves from the shore of nearness - these shall have no portion of this Paradise which hath been made manifest in the name of God. Taste at all times of the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge which hath been planted by the hands of God in the holy land. Avoid Mine enemies and hold fast unto My loved ones who have held fast unto the Sure Handle and have detached themselves from every remote idolator. Say: This is indeed the Day wherein, were ears to be purified from the clamor of the idolators, they would hear from all things: “By God the Truth! God hath come with manifest sovereignty.” Leave all remembrance behind thee, then hold fast unto the remembrance of the name of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, Who speaketh the truth in all things, that there is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth encompasseth all things. Thus have We imparted unto thee the Word of Truth and revealed unto thee that whereby are illumined the spirits of the Concourse on High and those who circle round the exalted Throne.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him before Whose fear all are apprehensive! This is a mention of thy Lord’s mercy unto His servant ’Ali, that He may establish him in the Cause and draw him nigh unto a mighty shore of holiness. O servant! Rejoice within thyself that the Pen of the Spirit hath remembered thee with hidden holy intimations. Yet He Who giveth thee these glad-tidings is in such sorrow as none can reckon save He Who hath numbered all things in a clear Book. Know thou that they who believed in ’Ali aforetime have now denied His splendor and His might and sovereignty, and this is an injustice wherewith no injustice in creation can compare, if thou be of them that are well-informed. Strive thou within thyself lest thou sell the Joseph of eternity for whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven, for through love of Him thou shalt become independent of all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, even shouldst thou possess not so much as a grain or atom of what is ordained on earth. And were His love not with thee, thou wouldst be poor though there be gathered unto thee the treasures of the heavens and the earth. This is a truth wherein there is no doubt, if thou be of them that know. Say: O people! Exchange not the favor of God for that which ye possess, and distance not yourselves from a near seat of glory. Say: The Beauty hath dawned from the horizon of holiness with such an adorning as hath bewildered every learned sage. Remember thou thyself, then remind the servants of this Cause at which every sanctified mystic hath been thunderstruck. Then stand thou firm in the Cause with God’s dignity and tranquility, and fear no one but place thy trust in God. Verily He shall suffice thee against every suspicious transgressor. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who are content with what God hath been content with, seeking His presence, and who are possessed of clear vision regarding their Lord’s command.</p>

<p>O My Worshipped One! Make mention of a word from the Youth to him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Bestower, that he may seize it with power from Us and cast aside that which is with those who have disbelieved in the Lord of Lords. Say: Open your eyes, O people of learning, to behold the Beauty, for verily it hath dawned from the horizon of glory and none opposeth it save every idolatrous doubter. He who hath not attained unto it is not possessed of true vision - thus hath the Revealer of the Book decreed. Say: O people! We created sight for the recognition of this Beauty, and he who hath not recognized it is blind, as they who are endued with understanding do testify. If your sight be weak, then seek illumination from Mine eye and through it behold Me, O ye who are endued with vision. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this bounty which hath been vouchsafed unto you without question or answer. Say: O people! This is He for Whom generations of old died in their yearning, yet when ye found Him without effort, ye turned heedless. Soon shall ye lament and weep, O ye who are veiled. Arise, O people, then address your supplication toward the Gate with humility and contrition. He who hath not attained unto the mention of this Most Great Remembrance is powerless, though he may speak with the tongue of all the worlds - thus doth He with Whom is the decisive Word bear witness. Grieve not at the wickedness of those who have disbelieved in this Revelation, for they are those who disbelieved in God throughout all ages. Say: O Lord! Preserve me through Thy sovereignty and power, then inscribe me with Thy righteous servants. O Lord! Cause me to be as Thou lovest and art pleased with, and leave me not to my passions, for verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Choosing.

<p>The Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted! A mention from Us to the Leaf who hath spoken upon the Tree of Knowledge even as the Dove hath warbled upon the branches. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the lights of the Countenance and been moved by the breezes of thy Lord’s will, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Beware lest the imaginings of those who have disbelieved in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds, hold thee back. Take firm hold of the Tree, then remember thy Lord with this wise remembrance. O Leaf! Praise be to God that through divine favors in these radiant days thou hast attained unto that which was intended. Be not grieved at the oppression of the enemies. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctification that whosoever in the days of the Lord of all possibility hath drunk of the choice wine of knowledge regardeth all who are on earth as non-existent and absent - how much more so the weak souls whom following their own desires and passions hath deprived of turning unto the Lord of Names and Creator of all things, and whose verbal limitations and manifestations of self have veiled them from the Dayspring of the All-Merciful. Observe how the people of the Qur’an have remained far from the Lord of all possibility. There is no doubt that they have been held back from the Lord of the Day of Judgment by the words of those possessed of vain imaginings. Likewise have the people of the Bayan been veiled from the Lord of Names and Attributes by their own imaginings, although all are commanded in this Revelation to fix their gaze upon the Revelation itself, not upon what they possess, even though it be the books of the first and the last. And this bounty hath been specially revealed in this Manifestation; nevertheless through falsehood they have been debarred from the Lord of Causes. Thou must stand firm in the Cause of God with such firmness as to be the cause of steadfastness in the weak ones. We beseech God to assist thee and strengthen thee in His remembrance and praise. Verily He is the Protector of those who remember and the Helper of those who remember.</p>

Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One Who hath been imprisoned for having summoned the people unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We desired light for the servants, but they desired for the Wronged One the fire of hatred and malice. Know thou assuredly that they are among the abased ones. Know that the glance of God’s loving-kindness hath been and continueth to be directed towards thee. Sorrow not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Say: My God, my God! Leave me not alone, for Thou art the Best of inheritors. My God, my God! Forsake me not in solitude, for Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. My God, my God! Through Thy power, ordain for me a helper and protector. O handmaiden of God! Today the decree of lineage is lifted, for nobility and exaltation depend solely upon God, glorified be His majesty. This Tablet is a manifest book and a great bounty. The world will change but this will not change. Every life is followed by death and every glory by abasement, but the glory of the Divine Word hath been and will continue to be eternal, its perpetuity sanctified from extinction and its rising sanctified from setting.

Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the One, the Mighty, the Great. We have sent thee, with this Tablet, a spirit from Our presence that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who are thankful. This is a day wherein My Supreme Pen speaks, yet most of the people are heedless. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them to thee that thou mayest find from them the fragrance of thy Lord’s garment, the Mighty, the All-Praised.

We have commanded all to wisdom - thou too must observe this, hold fast to wisdom and act wisely. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which will bring comfort to thine eyes and gladden thy heart. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous.

<p>The Most Mighty, Most Holy, Most Great. A remembrance for him who has turned to God and been illumined by the lights that have shone forth from the horizon of his Lord’s will, the Almighty, the Powerful, that the fragrances of verses might draw him to the station which the Manifestor of clear proofs has destined for him. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. Arise to make mention of thy Lord among the people, detached from those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Verily those who are heedless this day shall soon find themselves in the depths of the fire. Thus has the command been issued from the Pen of the All-Choosing in a mighty tablet. Blessed is he who has been illumined by this Lamp through which the heavens and earths have been made to shine. Blessed is he who has been enlightened by this Light through which the worlds have been illumined. Hold fast to the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of the Ancient of Days. Beware lest anything prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord or the words of the polytheists sadden thee. Turn not to the world and what is therein. Set thy gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Say: O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! I beseech Thee by the Dawning-Place of Thy most excellent names and the Source of Thy most exalted attributes, Who has been imprisoned in Thy path amidst the wicked, that Thou aid me to make mention of Thee and praise Thee, and assist me in serving Thee in such wise that neither the might of the transgressors nor the power of the evil ones shall hold me back. O my Lord! I am he who has turned to the door of Thy grace and set his face toward the throne of Thy grandeur. Ordain for me what is best, for I know not what profiteth me. Thou art verily the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty, the Wise. O my Lord! Deal with me according to Thy grace and bounty, then protect me from those who have denied Thy Manifestation and turned away from Thy Beauty. Make me then steadfast in Thy love in such wise that the winds that blow from the hearts of Thy heedless servants and the polytheists among Thy creatures shall not move me. Thou art verily the Protector over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>The springtime of divine knowledge has appeared through the blessing of God’s Most Great Name, and the leaves of inner realities are manifest, yet those with true vision are rare, save for the souls who have attained the choice wine of inner meanings and become possessed of true insight. The True One, exalted be His grandeur, gave glad tidings of His Day to all servants, as mentioned and recorded in most divine Books, Scriptures and Psalms. Yet when the Dawning Place of divine Will appeared and shone forth with the Sun of Manifestation, all were found heedless and turned away, except whom God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds, willed. Blessed is the soul who in these days has drunk from the ocean of recognition of the Lord of all possibilities and received their portion. By the Sun of the horizon of knowledge! Whosoever remains deprived of recognition of this triumphant Day, the regret thereof shall endure for them throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm. We have heard your call and have answered you with this noble Tablet. All things shall perish, but there shall remain for you what the All-Merciful has sent down in the Tablet. Preserve it and be of the thankful ones. In all conditions, beseech the True One, exalted and mighty be He, to keep all steadfast in this mighty Cause. Observe the heedless people who have forsaken God’s everlasting blessings and become attached to transient ornaments whose transformation, change and extinction they witness at every moment. Blessed is the powerful one who has shattered the idols of vain imaginings, and blessed is the one who has cast away what perishes and turned toward God, the Everlasting, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

We have stood before all faces on a Day wherein the hearts of the learned were sorely troubled and the limbs of all names did tremble, and We have manifested the Cause without veil or concealment. Among the people were those who turned toward the horizon of Revelation, and among them were those who turned away, and among them were those who took hold of the Book with such might as could not be weakened by the hosts and armies of the world. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken when the Wronged One was in the hands of the wicked. When thou hast drunk from the ocean of My utterance and beheld the lights of the Sun of My Revelation, say:</p>

Do ye bar men from the path of God while ye claim to be Muslims? Do ye read the verses of the Furqan, yet play with the verses of the All-Merciful?

Say: If ye possess a proof greater than that which hath been sent down from the clouds of the Command, produce it, if ye be truthful. Is the Book which ye possess greater than this? Glory be to God above what ye imagine! Say: All verses have been revealed from the presence of the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, and all clear proofs have appeared from the horizon of grace - do ye not see? Have ye any evidence greater than that which the All-Merciful hath brought? Nay, by the Lord of eternity, if ye but knew!

Do ye flee from the Truth while ye behold it? If ye are barred from the gate of grace, to what gate will ye turn? Thus hath the Salsabil of life flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful, that all people might know their drinking-place. Drink, O people, and be of those who prosper!

<p>In the name of the one God! Glorified be God! The people of the world are observed today to be deprived of both testimony and awareness. The call of the Manifestation of the Cause and Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation has been raised with the most exalted voice, such that through its sweetness even stones and date pits have become vocal in praise and glorification, yet the servants remain deprived of it. All things have testified to the appearance and exaltation of the Most Great Word, while humanity remains veiled and prevented, save whom God willeth. Do they not reflect upon former ages - what was the cause of the martyrdom of the Prophets and saints, and what was the reason for the ascension of Jesus son of Mary to the fourth heaven, and why did they deny the Seal of the Prophets (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him) and issue the verdict for the shedding of His pure blood? Why did they martyr Husayn son of Ali despite all testifying to his lineage? In brief, the divines of every age have arisen in opposition, and weak souls following those persons have closed their eyes to proof and evidence and turned toward the path of fire. In truth the entire life of the world is not worth mentioning, let alone these temples whose lives are like a breeze that enters through one door and exits through another. Nevertheless they have clung to it and deprived themselves of the eternal dominion and everlasting bounty. Blessed is the soul who today observes and reflects with penetrating vision upon the divine Cause and all that hath appeared, that there may be revealed unto him what was hidden from minds and eyes. It behooveth thee to thank God thy Lord and to arise concerning what thou hast missed. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Kind, the Generous.</p>

<p>All-praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God! I know not how to sing Thy praise, how to describe Thy glory, how to call upon Thy Name. If I call upon Thee by Thy Name, the All-Possessing, I am compelled to recognize that He Who holdeth in His hand the immediate destinies of all created things is but a vassal dependent upon Thee, and is the creation of but a word proceeding from Thy mouth. And if I proclaim Thee by the name of Him Who is the All-Compelling, I readily discover that He is but a suppliant fallen upon the dust, awe-stricken by Thy dreadful might, Thy sovereignty and power. And if I attempt to describe Thee by glorifying the oneness of Thy Being, I soon realize that such a conception is but a notion which mine own fancy hath woven, and that Thou hast ever been immeasurably exalted above the vain imaginations which the hearts of men have devised.</p>
<p>The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! Whoso claimeth to have known Thee hath, by virtue of such a claim, testified to his own ignorance; and whoso believeth himself to have attained unto Thee, all the atoms of the earth would attest his powerlessness and proclaim his failure. Thou hast, however, by virtue of Thy mercy that hath surpassed the kingdoms of earth and heaven, deigned to accept from Thy servants the laud and honor they pay to Thine own exalted Self, and hast bidden them celebrate Thy glory, that the ensigns of Thy guidance may be unfurled in Thy cities and the tokens of Thy mercy be spread abroad among Thy nations, and that each and all may be enabled to attain unto that which Thou hast destined for them by Thy decree, and ordained unto them through Thine irrevocable will and purpose.</p>
<p>Having testified, therefore, unto mine own impotence and the impotence of Thy servants, I beseech Thee, by the brightness of the light of Thy beauty, not to refuse Thy creatures attainment to the shores of Thy most holy ocean. Draw them, then, O my God, through the Divine sweetness of Thy melodies, towards the throne of Thy glory and the seat of Thine eternal holiness. Thou art, verily, the Most Powerful, the Supreme Ruler, the Great Giver, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Desired.</p>
<p>Grant, then, O my God, that Thy servant who hath turned towards Thee, hath fixed his gaze upon Thee, and clung to the cord of Thy mercifulness and favor, may be enabled to partake of the living waters of Thy mercy and grace. Cause him, then, to ascend unto the heights to which he aspireth, and withhold him not from that which Thou dost possess. Thou art, verily, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.</p>

O servants! I have made all things dependent upon means, and ordained it to be the cause of the Most Great Resurrection and the instrument of the Most Great Revival. For example, through the means of power I make manifest and resurrect in the kingdom one who was rebellious, hidden and forsaken, in such wise that all will recognize him. And through the assistance of causative manifestations, I reveal to all the worlds the concealed tyranny of the excluded oppressor. Through the means of wealth I distinguish between generosity and miserliness, and through the means of deeds I make evident knowledge and ignorance. Many an oppressor who, through being deprived of means, became known as just. Thus at all times the manifest resurrection is apparent and visible, even though people may be heedless of recognizing it. Through My wondrous favor and My sublime mercy, no moment is deprived of the excellences of the days, much less the souls of holy transcendence. The incomprehensible resurrection has been and shall be dependent upon the unknowable Beauty, just as on this blessed night I have resurrected My servants through these revealed letters in such wise that none but My Self is aware of those souls and the nature of this spiritual resurrection. And I have made manifest wondrous and mighty means in this eternal night, causing resurrection and making it dependent upon the discernment of the people of wisdom and insight. Whosoever comprehends this wondrous power will become independent of all who dwell on earth. For example, even in outer livelihood he will find himself in want of nothing, not even requiring a mount for travel.

The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have not violated the Covenant of God and His Testament - these are they who are numbered among the near ones in a mighty Book.</p>

<p>The world is in turmoil and whatsoever hath been recorded and set down by the Pen of Revelation in the Sacred Tablets is now manifest and evident. May that soul ever drink from the choice wine of the mystic knowledge of the Beloved of the worlds, and may he shine forth in the assemblage of the world even as the morning star, brilliant and resplendent, manifest and radiant. That which proceedeth from God will verily endure and persist. How excellent is the state of the one who hath attained unto the days of God and inhaled the fragrance of the merciful Garment. Render thou thanks unto God for having recognized, discovered, turned thyself and attained unto the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. In these days several letters from that land arrived at the Most Great Prison and attained the presence of the Wronged One of the horizons, and the answer to each one hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will. Should that soul examine them, it would be most pleasing. May thou ever drink from the chalice of bounty and fix thy gaze upon the horizon of contentment. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends in that land and say: This is a Day wherein every soul must strive with utmost endeavor to seek the choice wine of steadfastness from God, glorified be His majesty, inasmuch as the heedlessness of the peoples of the world hath reached such a pass that they distinguish not between good and evil, nor do they differentiate between truth and falsehood, save for a few whose eyes have been anointed with the salve of insight. I beseech God to aid His servants to witness and hearken. He, verily, is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing. The glory rest upon thee and upon thy family and thy children and those who are with thee in this Cause whereby faces have been illumined and hearts enlightened.</p>

<p>This servant submits to your honor that the letter of his holiness Afnan 92 [Muhammad], upon him be all the most glorious Baha, which you gave to this servant was read. And it so happened that at that very moment it was presented to the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of loving-kindness rose and shone forth in relation to him, and the Tongue of Grace spoke this most exalted Word - His word, exalted be His majesty: “We verily magnify the one who teaches My Cause and My Afnans who have attained unto My days and have arisen to serve My Cause. These are servants whom We have preferred above Our servants and Our creation, and We have written for them from the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book a station which was in truth exalted, and We have related them to My Self and made them branches of My Tree. To this beareth witness My Self, the Truth, and behind it My Book which was from the horizon of the Cause visible.” Should anyone reflect upon that which hath been bestowed upon them, they would declare “this is naught but a great bounty and a noble station.” His honor Muhammad, one of My Afnans, upon him be My glory, is engaged in serving the Cause. God willing, may he ever be assisted. “We verily assisted him before and manifested through him that which caused the fragrance of detachment to be diffused throughout creation. Thus hath spoken the Pen in this station which was through justice raised up.”</p>
<p>O Javad! The servant who is present hath presented his letter before the Wronged One. We have heard and answered. Verily thy Lord was ever-hearing, ever-answering. Give him the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for him from the prison, that he may rejoice in that which was from the heaven of revelation sent down. Glory be upon him and upon them and upon whosoever was steadfast in the Cause.</p>

The Command is in God’s hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. The letter Sin will present the details of all that hath transpired, and ye shall be informed thereof.

<p>O Shaykh Fani, upon him be the Glory of God! It behooveth them that are evanescent to summon the servants, at all times, to the direction of the All-Merciful, inasmuch as whosoever hath become evanescent from self will attain unto everlasting life in God - that is, he will circle eternally round the Truth in all the worlds.

Have mercy upon Thy servants!” and are gazing upon those souls whom the trials and tribulations that have befallen them have not kept back from the Court of the Divine Unity. Ye have ever been mentioned in the presence of the Throne. Strive ye, that the seedlings of the Bayan may not wither from the poisonous winds of test and trial.</p>
<p>The remembrance of God is like the rain of mercy upon the seeds of inner meaning that have been deposited within hearts. Therefore it is necessary and obligatory to be engaged at all times in the remembrance of the Lord of all worlds, and to follow this servant in all matters. As ye observe, the Ancient Beauty, despite all the afflictions that have befallen Him, hath not been prevented from the divine remembrance, but hath at all times summoned the people to the summit of true understanding, that perchance feeble souls may purpose to ascend the heights of divine oneness and become purified and sanctified from the promptings of self and passion.</p>

This is Thy servant who hath been heedless of the wonders of Thy remembrance, and whom transgressions have veiled to such degree that he became occupied with what is other than Thee and turned away from Thy beauty, and who did with his feet what Thou didst abhor, and committed with his hands what Thou didst oppose, and uttered with his tongue what beseemeth not Thy loved ones, and harbored in his heart what befitteth not Thy servants. Yet after all this, since he was aforetime among those who believed in Thee and in Thy greatest signs, the breezes of mercy wafted over him such that they awakened him from slumber and brought him forth from heedlessness, until he recognized what he had done and knew wherein he had been engaged, and returned unto Thee as he had fled from Thee in the midst of his affairs, and entered the stronghold of Thy providence as he had departed therefrom in certain of his days. Therefore, O my God, it behooveth the wonders of Thy mercy and the gems of Thy providence not to deprive him of the rain-showers of Thy generosity and the clouds of Thy tenderness and loving-kindness, that Thou mayest find him abiding by the covenant which he made with Thy loved ones. Then forgive, O my God, his grievous offenses and his grave transgressions. Then wash him, O my Beloved, in the seas of Thy bounty and forgiveness and in the deep waters of Thy grace and favor, and turn him from every direction toward the right hand of Thy holy might, that he may dwell not on earth save through Thy Name, nor move except with Thy good-pleasure, nor walk except by Thy leave, nor eat nor drink except in Thy remembrance, for in Thy hand is the kingdom of all things and Thou art powerful over all things. And send down, O my God, upon those who have detached themselves unto Thee and taken refuge at Thy court and sought sanctuary in Thy presence and dwelt beneath the shadow of Thy loving-kindness, all that is possible in the Most Exalted Paradise and in the lands of Paradise, for verily Thou art the Self-Subsisting, the Most Holy.</p>

Thou seest and knowest the evil of my condition, the trembling of my body, the quivering of my limbs, the flowing of my tears, the paleness of my face, the stumbling of my pen and tongue, the sighing of my innermost being, and the agitation of my heart. I desire to write this letter of mine to those whom Thou hast related to the Tree of Thy Cause, whom Thou hast singled out for the manifestation of Thy Being, whom Thou hast chosen from among Thy creatures, and whom Thou hast named the Branches that have branched from the Lote-Tree of Thy oneness. Thou hast made them lights in Thy lands, lamps for the guidance of Thy creation, tranquility and dignity among Thy servants, a sign in Thy kingdom, and a joy to the hearts of Thy chosen ones who have believed in Thee, in Thy verses and in meeting Thee. O Glory of the world and Trust of the nations! Were it not for them in Thy earth, from where would the traces of Thy holiness appear? And were it not for their existence, from where would the lights of Thy bounty shine forth? For they are the manifestations of sanctification among Thy servants, the dawning-places of glorification among Thy creation, the proclaimers of Thy verses, and the spreaders of Thy tablets in Thy lands, and the means of goodness for Thy chosen ones. And all grace is from Thee, for Thou didst manifest in them the Temple of Thy Most Exalted Self, Who gave glad tidings to the servants of Thy Most Glorious Beauty and called out with the loudest call in the wilderness of the Bayan: “Come, O people of the worlds, to the Garden and the Orchard of the Bayan!” And He took from all contingent beings the covenant of Thy Manifestation. But when the sun of Thy Most Glorious Beauty dawned from the Most Exalted Horizon, the people of allusions turned away and denied the verses and clear proofs after their realities had been established through them. Alas, alas, for their turning away and their objections! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Beauty to give to drink from the wine of Thy reunion to all who have forsaken Thee, and to cause all who have heard Thee to hearken to the verses of Thy Beauty. Disappoint not those who hope in Thee, and drive not away those who long for Thee, for Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Merciful.</p>

Follow Him Who hath come unto you and commandeth righteousness and piety - verily He is among the sincere counselors in this manifest time.

Your letter came before the Face while in prison, and its opening was adorned with the word which We have loved in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and which We have desired for Myself and for those with Me. And your Lord, the All-Merciful, He is indeed cognizant of what I say. And this is it: “Would that I had been among those martyred in Thy path!” By My life! By this yearning the Glance of God turned toward you and the denizens of the Supreme Concourse drew near unto you, but the people do not understand. Because of this, your yearning, We have recorded for you the reward of one martyred in My path. Verily your Lord is the Forgiving, the Loving. Know thou that in such days as these, whoso arises to make mention of God, the Creator of Names, amidst His ignorant servants - he is indeed of those who have attained unto the best of what hath been and what shall be. Reflect upon these days, that their greatness and He Who hath appeared in them through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praised, may become evident unto thee. The greatest of all deeds is the mention of thy Lord amongst His servants - thus hath it been sent down in a preserved Tablet. Whoso attaineth unto this hath attained unto that which God hath desired for him. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, but the people remain veiled therefrom. Arise from the horizon of certitude through the power of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Then enter the dwelling-place of the polytheists among the people of the Bayan who have disbelieved in God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Say: O people! Abandon that which is vain - the Self-Subsisting hath come upon the clouds of proof. Verily, He is your Lord, the All-Merciful, upon Whom the Bayan depended. Fear God and follow not those who are heedless. Thus have We imparted unto thee that whereby the hearts of those who have turned toward the Countenance with humility and reverence may be quickened. We have ordained for thee a reward unfailing. Rejoice thou in this and hold fast unto the cord of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>Your letter has come before the Countenance and the gaze of your Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful, has turned toward it. We found from it the fragrance of your love for your Lord, therefore We answer you with verses which have dawned from the horizon of the favors of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Qiblih of existence and for having thy name flow from the Most Exalted Pen, which God has made the Sovereign of all pens. Arise to make mention of God in such wise that the sweet savors of the garment may be wafted among all peoples. We have mentioned thee before and mention thee in this Tablet that it may be a reminder to people of understanding. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, detached from all possibility. We have ordained for thee a station in the Tablets. Grieve not over anything - soon We shall aid thee through the truth. Verily He does not fail in His promise.</p>
<p>Previously a glorious Tablet was sent. Be not sorrowful or distressed about any matter. Praise be to God, through the grace of the All-Merciful and the favors of the All-Glorious, the sea of joy is surging and the rivers of gladness flow from the right hand of the Throne. Draw nigh unto it and drink therefrom at all times. By My life, it shall seize thee and attract thee in such wise that thou shalt see all who are in the realm as more insignificant than ashes. Thus doth thy Lord, the Lord of creation, remember thee.</p>
<p>In all conditions be occupied with serving the Cause and be mindful of wisdom and utterance. Blessed art thou for having arisen and spoken in praise of thy Lord, and blessed are they who hear thy words concerning this Light which hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>What rests with you is the teaching of the Cause. As for other matters, they are within the grasp of power. Soon He shall set all things aright. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Adorn all the loved ones in that land with the ornament of the Most Great Name of the Ancient King, and upon thee and upon them be glory.</p>

<p>Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One and the servant present before His face hath presented it. We have heard and answer thee through this perspicuous Tablet. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call and answered his Lord. Verily he is among the people of Baha in the Crimson Book. The Concourse on High and they that circle round their Lord’s throne, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, shall pray for him.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hearken unto the Call from the prison precinct from this Wronged One, Who hath been encompassed by the swine and dogs of the earth - they who have risen in opposition, such that by their tyranny the dwellers of thy Lord’s kingdom, the Almighty, the Powerful, have lamented. We counsel thee and those who have believed to unity and concord in this Cause, whereby the pillars of the divines of the earth who have broken God’s Covenant, the Lord of all worlds, have been shaken. Through the light of unity doth the world become illumined, and through concord is gathered together what was scattered throughout the earth. Thy Lord is verily the Elucidator, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him when most people turned away, and for having remembered thy Lord when the people were in evident doubt. When the crier cometh, leave him behind you, turning towards God, the Single, the All-Informed. He will come to you with a subtlety the like of which the eye of creation hath never seen. Thus doth the One possessed of knowledge of all things inform you, from a Mighty, Near One.</p>
<p>We counsel all to act according to what hath been revealed in God’s Book and that whereby this Most Great Announcement may be uplifted. Remember God’s loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of My loving-kindness and bounty, which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is the servant who hath held fast to the Book and who hath drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of the Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have cast aside the world’s vain imaginings, holding fast to that which hath been sent down from the presence of an Ancient One.

<p>O Ibrahim! The Wronged One hath heard thy call and calleth thee with His most sweet voice between earth and heaven, saying: “O Ibrahim! The tale of the fire hath been renewed, and My Friend hath been consumed thereby in the land of Sad - he who dawned forth from the horizon of faithfulness with the love of God, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And the account of the sacrifice and the sacrificed one hath been renewed - he who returned not from the place of sacrifice but gave up his spirit in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. God hath seized him who did wrong, and He shall soon seize those who disputed His signs and denied His manifest proof. Well is it with thee for having drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the Generous, and for having circled round the fire until thou didst enter it and wast enkindled with the fire of God, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who hath heard My call and soared in My atmosphere and was attracted by the rustling of My Lote-Tree and the cooing of My Dove that speaketh: ‘There is none other God besides Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.’ We have indeed found the fragrance of thy love and beheld thee turning toward Our most exalted horizon. We make mention of thee in this Tablet, before which, when it was sent down from the kingdom of the command of thy Lord, all the books of the world bowed down in submission. Blessed is he who hath turned toward it and rendered thanks, and woe unto those who have turned away. Give thanks unto God for having caused thee to hear the scratching of His Pen and for having mentioned thee in such wise that thy name shall endure in His mighty and impregnable kingdom. When thou hast received My Tablet and been intoxicated with the wine of My utterance, turn thy face toward My Prison and say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged and lonely, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the ocean of life surged in all creation and all things spoke forth: “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Most High, the Most Great!”’ We beseech God to make thee steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped save such as God, the Peerless, the All-Informed, hath willed.”</p>

We beseech God to aid thee and enable thee to remember Him, to praise Him and to serve His Cause. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My utterance and found the fragrance of the All-Merciful from My words, say: My God, my God! Separation from Thee hath destroyed me, remoteness from Thee hath consumed me, Thy Manifestation hath bewildered me, Thy verses have enkindled me, and Thy clear tokens have attracted me. I beseech Thee by the Word through which they that are nigh hastened to the place of sacrifice, to ordain for me, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, the reward of attaining Thy presence, of standing before Thy countenance, and of appearing at the door of Thy grandeur. O Lord! Thou seest me attracted by the breezes of Thy Revelation and soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love. I beseech Thee by the rain-showers of the dawn of Thy Manifestation and by the lights of Thy countenance to cause me, under all conditions, to hold fast to the cord of Thy grace and to act according to what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Strong, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>He hath loved and continueth to love His chosen ones, and hath come for their meeting and the manifestations of His bounty and favor. However, the oppression of the oppressors and the heedlessness of the heedless have become an obstacle. For some time now, the prison-land hath been in turmoil, for one from among the people of hatred occupied the seat of government for a period. Although he hath now returned to hell - meaning he was dismissed - yet until now the land hath not become settled. Therefore We have paused in giving permission to utter the Word. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We beseech of Him whatsoever is conducive to the good of this world and the next. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>

<p>The Ancient of Days, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! The pebbles have cried out in remembrance of this wise Remembrance, and all things have called out when the Dove sang forth “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Exalted, the Great!” The earth hath quaked from the breezes of God’s verses, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, and the ocean of eternity hath surged when the winds of grace blew from the direction of this Ancient Name. The heavens were illumined when We lit the lamp, and the horizon of the Cause shone forth from this wondrous dawn. The land of Syria hath been brightened by the lights of this Morn which hath shone forth from this manifest Light. The dwellers of Paradise have been seized with rapture, yet the people lie in profound heedlessness. By God! This is He Who hath desired neither to exalt His own self nor to perpetuate His name, nor hath He loved bodily comfort. He hath spent them all to exalt the Word of God. Blessed is he who pondereth and is of those who know. We have kindled the fire at the heart of the world, while from every direction the wicked pour upon it the waters of denial. Exalted is He Who hath preserved it through truth and made it to triumph over the idolaters. Though ye see Him vanquished, by My life He is the Victor over all who are in the heavens and earth. And though ye see Him subjugated, He is in truth the Subduer. Blessed are they who perceive, who have insights from God and who are among those who discern in the signs of their Lord. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses that thou mayest recite them in thy days - they are clear proofs from God, the Mighty, the Generous. When thy spirit soareth on the wine of thy Lord’s mercy, arise amidst creation and remind them of this Cause whereby the heavens have been adorned and the faces of the sincere have been illumined. Be thou of such constancy that the whisperings of the people move thee not, nor do the utterances of the idolaters veil thee. This behooveth thee if thou wouldst shine forth from the horizon of might in My Name, the Chosen One, and this beseemeth thee and those who have turned to God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>

The ocean of knowledge hath surged and the pool of fancy hath subsided, inasmuch as the horizon of certitude hath been illumined by My Most Great Name. They that have turned unto God and held fast unto that which hath been sent down from Him - these are men of understanding. And they that have cast the laws of God behind their backs - these are a people who comprehend not. We testify that they have not heard the call of God nor found the sweetness of utterance, nay, they know not. The people are drowning in the sea of idle fancies save those who have held fast to the Most Great Cord and turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. If thou shouldst ask the atoms about the Source of verses, they would say: “He hath come with His holy, mighty and inaccessible kingdom!” Ask God to purify the ears that people may hearken unto the call of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and glorify Him whether seated or standing. Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the veils and burned away the shrouds that withheld him from God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. Be thou steadfast in the service of thy Lord and trust in Him in all matters. By My life! Whoso pondereth upon former ages will not be saddened by the intimations of men; rather will he be attracted by the breezes of revelation and find himself detached from those who have denied God, the Fulfiller of covenants. The lamp proclaimeth and saith: “Ye were created for light - how long will ye flee and remain unaware?” This is My Most Great Day, wherein the Lord of destiny proclaimeth: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of what was and what shall be!” Arise in My name to serve My Cause, that perchance the people may awaken and turn unto the praiseworthy station. Preserve thou the Tablet of God, then recite it - verily it shall guide thee to the ocean of joy. Thus have We adorned the Book with the outpourings of My Most Exalted Pen. This is of My grace unto thee, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>

For whosoever turned toward it was accounted before God among the companions of the right hand who have attained the lights of His countenance, and whosoever turned away was mentioned as one of the people of fire. Praise be to God that you have found life through the living waters which are known as the Kawthar of divine knowledge in God’s Book, and have attained unto a new life. Preserve this station with the utmost diligence and effort. The world has never had, nor has, any faithfulness, as is observed at all times. Blessed is the soul who is not deprived and forbidden from the eternal Kingdom on account of this transient world. God’s favor has been and will continue to be with you, as He has preserved you in numerous instances. Be grateful to thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We give thee glad tidings with a word from Our presence and say: Verily thou art among the secure ones. It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast in the Cause of God, and it is incumbent upon Him to protect thee through His sovereignty which prevails over the worlds. We beseech God to manifest through thee that whereby thy mention shall endure in His Kingdom and His dominion and in His perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of the peerless Lord! The Pen of the All-Merciful reminds those who seek the Yemen of divine knowledge through Its wondrous remembrances, that perchance all may pass beyond their own desires and fix their gaze upon His Cause and move according to His will. This is the supreme bounty for all, should they discover and attain unto it. There is no doubt that whatsoever God commands is the Water of Life and the quickener of bodies, for He hath ever gazed with loving kindness upon His loved ones and commanded all that which leadeth to salvation, rest and attainment unto truth. Today it behooveth all to adorn themselves with the raiment of holiness and detachment, for souls that are turned to carnal desires are neither worthy of the Most Holy Court nor befitting the Most Great Scene. God hath ever been established upon the throne of oneness and hath had no peer or likeness. God willing, may all attain through His grace unto this station and become detached and freed from aught else but Him. [Today] it is incumbent upon you to arise to serve the Cause and manifest complete steadfastness, in such wise that the words of the deluded may not hold you back from the Lord of all worlds. Know all but Him to be transient and remain firm in His love. How excellent is the state of those souls who have today quaffed the choice wine of divine knowledge from the hand of the bounty of the Lord [of Mercy]. These are the most excellent of people, the most distinguished among them, and the nearest unto God. Praise ye the Beloved of the world that ye have attained unto His love and are voicing His remembrance. Beseech Him to make you so steadfast that none shall have the power to prevent you. Glory be upon you, O My loved ones.</p>

<p>Once again hearken unto the Call from the luminous Spot, the place wherein speaketh the Lord of Names. The Prison is become a dawning-place for the revelation of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By My life! The Prison is My habitation, and it is more glorious than all other habitations, were ye of those who know. Though My hand hath opened the gate of the Prison, yet My heart desireth to remain therein. Thy Lord is, verily, the Expositor, the All-Wise. The Chief desired My humiliation, My injury and My imprisonment, but God seized him with power from His presence. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. That which was revealed in the Tablet to the Chief hath come to pass. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. We came forth from the Prison through a power from Our presence, despite his will, then returned unto it. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

At times palaces and paradise became the footstool of the feet of the All-Merciful, yet in every case He chose to return to the Prison, for it is adorned with the Name of Truth and established in the path of the Friend. He Who remembereth thee is the Truth - to this testify all atoms. He is the Truth and He is the Friend. Blessed is he who knoweth and is of the thankful ones. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to make mention of Him and to praise Him, and for having honored thee through His Book which shall endure as long as His names and attributes endure. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Thy letter hath attained unto the Most Great Vision, and We have read it and answered thee with this wondrous Tablet that thou mayest find therein the fragrance of the loving-kindness of thy Lord and make mention of Him with a mention whereby the hearts of those who have turned unto Him shall be attracted. Praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, from the presence of One Who is Forgiving, Merciful.</p>

At this time it hath been granted, and the luminary of permission hath dawned and appeared from the horizon of the heaven of God’s command.

<p>O thou who art mentioned by My Pen! Arise to make mention of Me and to praise Me amongst My servants, and make known to them My Cause and My Path. Then impart unto them My Word whereby the Rock hath cried out and the foundations have trembled. Say: O heedless ones! By God, He hath come at Whose advent hearts were troubled and through Whom the fragrance of the All-Merciful was wafted throughout all lands. Say: Beware lest what ye possess prevent you from that which is with God. Cast away vain imaginings and hold fast unto the cord of the care of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. This is a Day whereon neither the ornaments of the earth nor its hosts and arts shall profit you. Fear God and follow not every wicked deceiver. When the promise came to pass and the Dayspring of Manifestation shone forth, the divines turned away from Him until they pronounced judgment with such tyranny as caused the Concourse on High to lament, and behind them every discerning knower.</p>
<p>We have revealed the Cause and shown the servants Our most exalted horizon and guided them to the straight path. Confine thy affairs to making mention of Me among My creatures with the wisdom We have sent down in the Book. Thus have We illumined the horizons of utterance with the light of knowledge. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Convey My glorification to My loved ones who have cast the world behind them in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon him who hath turned unto God in his final return.</p>

<p>O Nabil, son of Nabil, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His majesty, greatness and power! You have always been and continue to be mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. From the earliest days until now you have been speaking in remembrance, gazing toward the horizon, turning to His countenance, and arising in service. The treasures of the earth cannot equal this testimony, nor can the words of men deny it. Be not grieved by what has befallen you. For the sake of God they have said that which cannot be uttered by the tongue. One of God’s names is the All-Patient, and He has commanded His loved ones to beautiful patience. The Most Great Branch was present before the Wronged One and presented your letter in its entirety. We heard it and have graciously responded with this Most Holy Tablet. Continue attending to affairs with the utmost joy, delight and greatest gladness. We beseech God to assist you in completing your tasks. You have truly undergone hardship, but arise to set matters right with perfect steadfastness. Until now, no one’s words regarding your affairs have been heard with acceptance. Convey greetings to the friends, especially to the two sons. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me, made me know Thee, and taught me Thy straight path. I beseech Thee by Him through whose advent the heights of knowledge and wisdom were adorned, through whom the fragrances of Thy revelation, the manifestations of Thy verses, the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance, and the lights of the luminary of Thy bounty were cut off - to assist me in setting right my affairs and the affairs of Thy servants. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning to Thee, detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by the Word of Unity, by Thy pervading Will and Thy all-encompassing Purpose, to ordain for me the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>The Tongue of Divine Revelation in the Kingdom of Utterance speaks this blessed word: This is the Day which all books and scriptures have testified to its appearance, and all peoples, nay the heavens and earths and hills and mountains and waters and seas - all were given glad tidings of this luminous Day. For this Day among all days has been attributed to God, exalted be His glory and might. Blessed is the one who has recognized it and has attained to the outpourings of the seas of knowledge of the All-Bountiful Lord. By My life! He is among those whom the Concourse on High remember, and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. God willing, you must in all conditions speak in remembrance and praise of God, and hold fast to the cord of this mighty Cause. Verily He is with His servants who remember Him. We make mention of him who mentions his Lord, and We turn from this remote spot toward him who has drawn nigh unto God and turned to His shining countenance. If one observes with the eye of insight, he testifies that God’s remembrance of His loved ones is greater than all else - it is like a tree whose roots are fixed in the earth of certitude and whose branches reach into the heaven of meanings and utterance, yielding its fruits throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm of spirit. Blessed is he who attains unto it, and woe to the heedless. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and glorify God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. To all those souls in that land who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and have been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth, convey to all of them the greetings from this Wronged One and gladden them with divine favors. Blessed are they, for theirs is a goodly end. The Glory be upon you.</p>

<p>O Abu-Turab Hakim, upon him be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance! By God’s life, the people of Iran are wed to vain imaginings. Even if the horizons of every land were illumined with the lights of the Sun of justice and certitude, they would pay it no heed. They turn to an imaginary pool instead of the sealed wine, and incline to the putrid waters of self rather than the divine Kawthar. Glory be to God! They have taken as lord, besides God, one who stood before His face. O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! That which hath streamed forth from the Supreme Pen in the most glorious horizon standeth distinct like the sun from all else. Nevertheless, the immature ones of the world have said that which caused the Kingdom of Utterance to weep and the Primal Point to cry out. Say: O people of the Bayan! Read what ye have and We shall read what We have, and be not of the heedless. They have preferred the dawning-place of idle fancies to the Lord of All Being. At every moment they burn with the fire of malice and hatred, and perceive it not. When thou dost win to My Tablet and find the fragrance of revelation in My utterance, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for showing me Thy signs, causing me to hear the scratching of Thy Pen, and illumining my heart with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, O God of the kingdom of earth and heaven and Sovereign of the realm of might, to aid me to arise to serve Thee with such steadfastness as will establish the people of Thy dominion, and to enable me to remember and praise Thee in such wise as will cause the tongues of all created things to speak thereby. O Thou Revealer of verses and Manifestor of clear proofs! I testify that through Thy manifestation the mysteries were revealed and the signs appeared. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and hearken to thy words concerning the mighty, transcendent and glorious Cause of God.</p>

<p>Praised be Thou, O my God, that Thou hast ordained Naw-Ruz as a festival unto those who have observed the fast for love of Thee and abstained from all that is abhorrent unto Thee. Grant, O my Lord, that the fire of Thy love and the heat produced by the fast enjoined by Thee may inflame them in Thy Cause, and make them to be occupied with Thy praise and with remembrance of Thee.</p>
<p>Since Thou hast adorned them, O my Lord, with the ornament of the fast prescribed by Thee, do Thou adorn them also with the ornament of Thine acceptance, through Thy grace and bountiful favor. For the doings of men are all dependent upon Thy good-pleasure, and are conditioned by Thy behest. Shouldst Thou regard him who hath broken the fast as one who hath observed it, such a man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had been keeping the fast. And shouldst Thou decree that he who hath observed the fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered with such as have caused the Robe of Thy Revelation to be stained with dust, and been far removed from the crystal waters of this living Fountain.</p>
<p>Thou art He through Whom the ensign “Praiseworthy art Thou in Thy works” hath been lifted up, and the standard “Obeyed art Thou in Thy behest” hath been unfurled. Make known this Thy station, O my God, unto Thy servants, that they may be made aware that the excellence of all things is dependent upon Thy bidding and Thy word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned by Thy leave and the good-pleasure of Thy will, and may recognize that the reins of men’s doings are within the grasp of Thine acceptance and Thy commandment. Make this known unto them, that nothing whatsoever may shut them out from Thy Beauty, in these days whereon the Christ exclaimeth: “All dominion is Thine, O Thou the Begetter of the Spirit (Jesus)”; and Thy Friend (Muhammad) crieth out: “Glory be to Thee, O Thou the Best-Beloved, for that Thou hast uncovered Thy Beauty, and written down for Thy chosen ones what will cause them to attain unto the seat of the revelation of Thy Most Great Name, through which all the peoples have lamented except such as have detached themselves from all else except Thee, and set themselves towards Him Who is the Revealer of Thyself and the Manifestation of Thine attributes.”</p>
<p>He Who is Thy Branch and all Thy company, O my Lord, have broken this day their fast, after having observed it within the precincts of Thy court, and in their eagerness to please Thee. Do Thou ordain for Him, and for them, and for all such as have entered Thy presence in those days all the good Thou didst destine in Thy Book. Supply them, then, with that which will profit them, in both this life and in the life beyond.</p>

The effulgences of the rays of the Sun of the Utterance of the Desired One of the worlds have encompassed all. The tyranny of oppressors, the might of the heedless ones, and the clamor of the divines could not prevent or hold back the Will of God, and the Cause has reached such a station that the kings of the world have desired to become aware of its purpose. We beseech God to aid all to perform those deeds which have been revealed by the Supreme Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. Know thou with evident certitude that the power of the Most Great Word and the penetrating influence of the Supreme Pen cannot be prevented or hindered by the clamor of those who wear turbans who, in the presence of the ocean of knowledge, are accounted among the ignorant. Blessed art thou for having turned towards God, heard His call and believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. All that hath befallen you hath been mentioned in the most holy and exalted Court and recorded in God’s Book. We heard thy call before and after, and have answered thee through this perspicuous Tablet. Soon all that is visible shall return to nothingness, while that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning the station of the friends shall endure and remain, and shall neither be erased nor altered. The friends in that land must unite and occupy themselves with teaching the Cause of God through wisdom and utterance. This is the service that hath been mentioned in the Tablets. Blessed are they that act accordingly. One of My leaves hath ascended unto the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to send down upon her mercy from His presence, to forgive her through His bounty and generosity, and to cause to descend upon her that which befitteth His grace and bounty. He is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The Glory be upon thee and upon every servant who hath believed in God, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Bounteous.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, once again thou hast drunk from the living waters from the gracious hand of the Desire of the worlds. Ever hath thy mention been before the Most Holy Court, yet at first with joy and gladness and delight, and at the end with sorrow and regret and bewilderment. O Andalib! Thy sobriety gladdened Me even as thy intoxication saddened Me. Thou didst attain unto sobriety after intoxication. That which thou didst send hath been presented and the servant present read it. Then did the lips of sorrow smile with boundless joy. Therefore give thanks and be of those who are grateful. Thy praise and tribute are remembered before God. In all conditions the glance of loving-kindness hath been directed towards thee. God, exalted be His glory, hath loved and loveth faithfulness, and doth ever gaze upon this blessed name. The tongue uttered naught but words of regret until there came from thee that from which We perceived the fragrance of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Compassionate, the Gracious. O Andalib! We counsel thee with that whereby thy station shall be exalted and the fragrance of thy love shall be wafted abroad. Verily thy Lord loveth thee and counseleth thee, and He is the Counselor, the All-Wise. Thou must needs hold fast to such goodly deeds and praiseworthy character that their fragrance shall be diffused. In all conditions God hath confirmed and will confirm thee. Be thou assured and be of those who are steadfast. One such as thee must arise to reform the world, turning unto Him. This beseemeth thee, as attesteth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. With spirit and joy speak thou in praise and glorification of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and act according to that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Verily We love thee and We love to behold thee as beseemeth thee in the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.

Similarly, a tray and two rulers arrived the day before that - it is not known who caused the delay. In any case, they arrived and were examined. Regarding the ruler for the pot lid, it was supposed that his honor Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, would examine that ruler - it is very pleasing. Regarding the ruler for the basin, this one is not bad either, though the previous basin seemed better, therefore it was sent according to your honor’s request. Regarding the tray, it was given to his honor Khwajih and what you had written was mentioned. He said that a tray is not needed now - he wanted several coffee pots, and when the brass arrives, instructions will be given afterwards. Also, on the day when your honor was present, it was mentioned regarding the stand under the samovar that two or three places on it are bent and the middle does not stand firmly, but it was forgotten to give it to your honor. Now the tray and the basin ruler along with the basin - these three pieces - have been sent. The eggplant that you had written about, which the dear father was carrying, arrived. And today also, a basket that was sent by carriage has been enjoyed and is being enjoyed in remembrance of you. Surely your spiritual taste has also received and been blessed with a portion and share of it. Convey sublime remembrance to his honor Aqa Abdul-Rahim.

<p>Thy letter arrived and was perused in its entirety. The people have perpetrated an injustice such as to cast the kingdoms of earth and heaven into despondency, while the Twin Lights have manifested a degree of meekness under tribulation such that the dwellers of the heavenly realm have bewailed and lamented them. Consider thou the son of Zakariyya, who lost his head to please the courtesan of the era; and again the scion of the Prophet, who was slaughtered at the behest of the wastrel of the age: was it they who were martyred that lost, or was it those who wronged them? - in reply to which all things have cried out, exclaiming: “Yea, the latter are in perspicuous loss!” Although this calamity is most grievous, and the greatest abasement hath been witnessed on its account, yet, by the righteousness of God, is it in reality the mightiest honour, which hath but outwardly assumed the form of an abasement. Do thou preserve this lofty and most exalted station, nor have regard for that which is today apparent. God, verily, hath laid hold on wrongdoers in the past, and shall do so in the future; and He shall purge the earth of their like, and so raise up your station that all faces shall turn towards you, and all the tongues of the world shall recite your praise. Hearken thou unto the Call of this Wronged One, and lay fast hold on all that He hath mentioned. He, verily, is the Faithful Counsellor. See that thou spare no effort in doing all thou canst to protect the people’s claims upon the King of Martyrs, forasmuch as this matter is acceptable and pleasing in the sight of God, and a cause of exaltation and advancement. Do thou on behalf of this Wronged One make mention of all the relatives, and speak unto them words of consolation. He, verily, is the Comforter, the All-Knowing. God willing, thou wilt remain, as heretofore, beneath the glances of God’s loving providence. Rest assured, and be thou of the thankful. That which is incumbent upon thee is to ensure the contentment of the family of the Twin Martyrs - may the Glory of God rest upon them. Wert thou to ponder a while, thou wouldst know of a certainty that what hath befallen is, and ever shall be, an inestimable honour. Unto this testifieth He Who hath knowledge of the Book.

Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. All must gaze with perfect steadfastness toward the Supreme Horizon alone. This is true unity today. By God’s life! Whosoever attains thereunto shall abide forever in the sublime Paradise and most exalted Heaven through the perpetuity of God’s names. How blessed is thy brother!

<p>In the Name of the Desire of all worlds! The Call of the All-Merciful is raised, yet most of the servants are deprived of hearing it. The Countenance of the Ancient One has dawned from the Orient of the world, yet most people’s eyes are veiled and prevented from beholding it. The most pure Wine flows and is visible at the Greatest Scene, yet all are forbidden from drinking thereof save whom thy Lord willeth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The cause of the servants’ veiling from the Lord of Creation has been and will be the vain imaginings of the idolatrous souls and the idle fancies of heedless hearts. The Sun of certitude is shining, yet most are occupied with suppositions. The Sun of knowledge has risen, yet most remain cloistered in their own imaginings. Reflect upon the appearance of the Manifestations of Divine Unity - in every age and era when those Suns of the horizons of inner meanings rose and appeared by God’s command, most people arose in denial and attempted to cut down the divine Trees and Lotuses. This has been His way in past ages. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Aware. How excellent is the state of one who today sees with his own eyes and hears the Call of Truth with his own ears, and purifies and sanctifies his heart - which is the dawning-place of divine revelations - from people’s vain imaginings and what is with them, that he may become worthy and deserving of this Most Great Bounty and Supreme Grace. Blessed is he who drinks the wine of recognition from his Lord’s utterance - We testify that he is among the successful ones. Whoever acts upon what has been mentioned will assuredly attain to recognition of the Intended One and will turn toward the Friend.

O My handmaiden! Know thou the worth of My days, then soar with the wings of love unto the heaven of My tender care, then enter the pavilion of My glory and My favors. Beware lest anything withhold thee from My mention and My praise. Forsake all else out of love for My beauty, then speak forth My Name amongst the handmaidens, then arise with My Cause from the horizon of the heaven of My steadfastness in such wise that neither the veils of My creatures nor the intimations of My creation - whom We created to serve Me but who, when the time was fulfilled, turned away from My beauty and denied My signs - shall hinder thee.

We returned them to their graves, and when they entered therein their lamentation was raised and they said: “Verily we were in manifest error!” Soon shall the servants who have violated the Covenant and were among the wrongdoers return thereunto. Thus have We revealed unto thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of those women who stood firm in the Cause until they entered within the precincts of the mercy of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.

And if he recognized Him not, no blame attacheth unto him, for in those days We concealed Our face behind seventy thousand veils lest the eyes of the polytheists should fall upon it.</p>

<p>O Ali! If thou wouldst reflect upon My Cause and what hath befallen My Soul, thou wouldst detach thyself from thine own self out of love for the Cause of God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.</p>
<p>O Ali! Dost thou rejoice within thyself while the Eye of God sheddeth tears from the buffetings of the polytheists? Dost thou sit at home while the Beauty of the Cause is imprisoned in this remote land?</p>
<p>O Ali! All things weep over what hath befallen Me, even though My loved ones may be among those who rejoice. And thou grievest not over what hath come upon Us, for We have chosen affliction from all the peoples for Ourselves, that perchance Our sleeping servants might be awakened - they who have been heedless of the remembrance of their Lord and have disbelieved in God, the Protector, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.</p>

But when His Object and the Object of the mystics appeared in truth and was established upon the throne with manifest and clear sovereignty, then did most of the people of the Bayan deny Him, opposing Him then, before then, and after then. Among them were those who desired to shed His blood, those who calumniated Him, and those who derided the verses of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. By God! They committed what the basest of the earth committed not, and said what the heedless ones of old said not. And thou, O servant, purify thyself from the insinuations of those who disbelieved, then detach thyself from the idolaters, then remember Me in thy days.

<p>In the Name of the Most High, the Most Exalted! This is a Book from the Point of the Bayan, who was named Husayn between the heavens and earths, then by His most beautiful names among the concourse of the worlds, and was named by the tongue of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, as Baha, and by it all who are in the heavens and earths were struck with terror, and by it God distinguished between the unitarians and the polytheists, and by it the breezes of forgiveness wafted upon the temples of the sinners, and by it the sun of wealth shone upon the poor and needy, and by it the Dove warbled upon the twigs of the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End, and the Cock of the Throne crowed in the paradise of eternity, and the Tree of Sinai was set ablaze and spoke that there is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. O servant! By God, through this Name the horizon of the Bayan was rent asunder and the sun of inner meanings rose with manifest and evident sovereignty, yet the people veiled themselves from its lights and radiance, and took darkness as light for themselves instead of God, and such was the condition of these heedless ones. And verily I complain of those who disbelieved in God in this Revelation whereby the verses were sent down from all eternity, and the Beauty of God, the Sovereign King, the Most High, appeared with mighty lights, and there befell Him from His servants what befell no one else, and God is witness to what I say. And you, O servant, remember My days, then grieve with My grief, then weep for what befell Me from these wrongdoers. We beseech God to make you steadfast in love for the Youth and to provide you from the fruits of the Tree of His knowledge and to comfort you with His own Self in the Most Exalted Paradise, whose gate was opened through this Most Great, Most Holy, Supreme Name. And the mercy which descended from the heaven of the Command be upon you and upon those with you from among God’s remembering servants. And praise be to my Beloved and the Beloved of the mystics.</p>

<p>O Mulla Rahmatullah! He is the One manifest and speaking in the Kingdom of Utterance. This is a Book from Us to one among the servants, that it may draw him to the station of nearness and holiness and meeting, and give him to drink of the choice sealed wine, whose seal was broken by the name of God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, that he may forsake the world and turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein the Lord of all beings proclaims: “Verily, there is no God but Him, the One with power over what was and what shall be.” Take heed lest the imaginings of the servants veil thee from the Lord of creation. Leave them and what they possess and turn with an illumined heart to the Most Sublime Vision. This is better for thee than what thou hast and what thou seest. To this testify honored servants. Cast aside vain imaginings, then take hold of the Book of Certitude in the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of existence. By My life! What the people possess will profit thee not today. Seek in thy heart the Ultimate Goal, for it is the Dawning-place of thy Lord’s verses, the Mighty, the Loving. Today is the Master of Days, and the Hidden Mystery is manifest and speaking through the Manifestation of His Cause. Whosoever hath heard His call and turned toward His direction is accounted among those who have drawn nigh in the Book of the Exalted Ones, and other than this was and shall be rejected. The Most Great Balance is manifest and the Greatest Proof is resplendent. All have been and shall be measured by this Balance. God willing, may you receive your portion from the divine fragrances of His days and become the cause of exalting the Word of God, that all may attain unto the Most Great Ocean and be freed from the veils of imitation and vain imaginings. Say: O God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the horizons to make me know the Dawning-place of Thy Cause and the Manifestation of Thy signs. Then aid me to help Thy Cause among Thy creatures. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hastened with his heart to the precincts of Paradise and, when the Call was raised from the right side of the Luminous Spot, turned towards it, saying: “Here am I, O God of the worlds!” By My life! Were We to sprinkle upon the mountains from the ocean of the attraction of thy Lord’s Word, they would dance for love of their Lord, and were We to sprinkle it upon all created things, thou wouldst see them soaring in the air. Thus doth the Pen of Command make mention of thee from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed.</p>
<p>We have found thy longing and thy yearning, and have revealed for thee this Tablet which God hath made the Dawning-place of His verses among His servants and the Herald of His Cause among all created things. When thou hast attained unto it, recite it with the accent of innate nature. Thus doth the Lord of all created things command thee. Verily, it will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>Pay thou no heed to those who claim that which God hath not permitted them. Turn thy gaze rather to the Most Luminous Spot and the Most Sublime Vision. Say: I have turned towards Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of the heavens and of the earth! Say: We have manifested the proof in such wise that none throughout all creation can deny it, except him who hath transgressed the bounds of fairness and is numbered with the idolaters. Say: The Evidence hath prostrated itself before the countenance of its Lord, and the Proof circleth round the All-Glorious, and the Noble One calleth out between earth and heaven: “The Beloved hath come with dominion over all names. This is He by Whose name We adorned the Bayan and by Whose mention the books of the All-Merciful were embellished. Turn ye unto Him, O peoples of the earth, with illumined hearts!”</p>
<p>Blessed art thou inasmuch as nothing hath withheld thee from God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Thou hast cast aside what the people possess and taken what hath come to thee today from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The glory be upon thee and upon them that have turned to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!</p>

<p>O servant! Be not grieved within thyself that thou hast migrated unto God and hast not been honored with His presence, for God hath accepted thy obedience and hath inscribed thy name with the finger of power among those who have attained the presence of God, and this is of His bounty unto thee, that thou mayest be steadfast in the Cause. We were verily with thee in thy departure and arrival, and in thy bewilderment and grief, and We witnessed thy condition. Therefore, grieve not within thyself, but be joyous through the loving-kindness of thy Lord.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou hesitate in this Cause in these days wherein the feet of most of the servants have slipped from this Path which hath been raised up in the name of God. Arise in the Cause and fear no one. Then shun those who have disbelieved in God after He came upon the shadows of the Cause with manifest and evident sovereignty, and everything speaketh that there is no God but Him, and that this is indeed ’Ali Who hath appeared from the Most Glorious Horizon with a Command that hath encompassed all the worlds. Purify thyself from allusions and cling not to that which the people of the Furqan clung when We manifested the Face from behind the veils with a radiance that was mighty indeed upon the truth.

Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto that whereof the people of the earth are deprived, save whom God willeth, the Lord of the mighty Throne. The glory from Us be upon you both and upon My loved ones there and upon My leaves who have clung to the Tree that speaketh by night and by day: “O peoples of the earth! Let your eyes be solaced, for the Promised One hath come and the Hidden One hath been revealed with manifest sovereignty!”</p>

<p>The Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted! O people of possibility! Your Lord, the Most Merciful, hath made manifest the fragrances of the garment of glory throughout all worlds, and the Word of God hath been upraised, and the Herald hath called out: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing!” They who have found and turned unto Him, these are the people of Baha, inscribed in a mighty Tablet. And they who have turned away, all things curse them; verily, they are the companions of the Fire. Glad tidings unto him who hath on this day detached himself from all directions, turning toward God, the Revealer of verses. He is among God’s sincere servants - the denizens of Paradise and they who circle round God’s throne, the Almighty, the Most High, the Great, pray for him. O loved ones of God! Take ye the chalices of victory in the name of your Lord, Who ruleth over all the worlds. Then drink therefrom with His remembrance and praise, despite those who turned away from the countenance of their Lord after they were created to turn toward the dawning-place of His luminous Cause. How many a lofty one hath been abased, and how many a lowly one exalted through the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Impregnable! How many a learned one hath been reckoned as ignorant before the Throne, and how many an ignorant one confirmed with knowledge in the Tablet of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed! He doeth what He willeth as He pleaseth, and ordaineth what He desireth. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of everlasting life in the days of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and attained unto the lights of faith when the Lord of all religions appeared with manifest sovereignty. Pay no heed to the people and their vain fancies and allusions. Leave these behind thee, holding fast to that which hath been revealed by Him Who speaketh between the heavens and the earth that there is none other God but Him, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee. By My life! They are manifest signs that have appeared and shone forth from the horizon of the Will of thy Lord, yet the people are wrapped in thick veils. Rend asunder the veils through His Name, the Bestower, then make mention of thy Lord with wisdom and utterance. Thus doth this Wronged One command thee, the imprisoned, the exile, the lone and unique.</p>

<p>O friends of the All-Merciful in all lands! The Wronged One remembers you from His Most Great Prison and reminds you through His verses which draw you near to God, the Lord of all worlds. The Pen proclaims: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” The Tablet proclaims: “The Promise has come to pass and the Intended One has appeared with wondrous sovereignty.” The Light proclaims: “O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not the promptings of the transgressors. Set aside what the people possess and take what is with God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.” Aid Me through deeds and virtuous character, then gather beneath the banner of righteousness by command of the One Who orders, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Ancient. Upon it has been inscribed by My Most Glorious Pen: “Victory and triumph belong to God, the Mighty, the Wise.” Thus has the Tongue of Grandeur spoken out of love for you and to assist you in that which you were commanded in My Perspicuous Book. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and been seized by the intoxication of the Kawthar of My utterance, say: “My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the signs of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion, and by that which the Tongue of Thy Grandeur has spoken forth and appeared through Thy command and sovereignty, to ordain for me that which shall be a light unto my heart, a radiance unto my sight and a strength unto my limbs. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned with my heart to Thy most exalted horizon and desire from the wonders of Thy bounty that which shall make me content with Thy command, beholding Thy horizon and detached from all else besides Thee. Thou art He Whom the doubts of the people have not withheld, nor their allusions, nor their might and power from Thy will and purpose. Through Thee the banner ‘He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth’ was raised. Verily Thou art the Single One, the Unique, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.”</p>

<p>O friends of God and His party! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Verily I say, the people of the Bayan are today observed to be deprived of the recognition of the Divine Day and its conditions. Say: O concourse of the heedless ones! This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him, and neither names nor that which is with the learned shall profit you. Cast aside the dawning-places of idle fancies and take what ye are commanded in His perspicuous Book. Today the sun speaketh “The All-Bestowing hath come” and the sea uttereth “The Creator of the heavens hath appeared” and the Mountain rejoiceth and is occupied with the Dayspring of Revelation. Strive that the colors and things and means of these two days may not withhold you from the everlasting bounty and eternal food. In that land is present His Holiness the Afnan of the Divine Lote-Tree, upon him be the glory of God, the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Present yourselves before him in the nights and days, and be engaged in the recitation of the decisive verses. Through them shall be kindled in your hearts the fire of the love of God and the light of His knowledge, and from the horizon of the heaven of your hearts shall rise the sun of His utterance. Verily He is the One Who, through His word, hath power over all things and dominion over all things through His sovereignty which hath conquered all who are in the heavens and earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. And We make mention of Ahmad-i-Qabl-i-’Ali, upon him be My glory, and We give him the glad-tidings of that which We have manifested in his name - the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the treasuries of the Pen of his Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed is he in that he hath turned and attained in days wherein most of the servants have turned away, save whom God hath willed, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And We have sent down for him another Tablet that he may rejoice and be of those who are firmly established in this Cause whereby the limbs of the polytheists have quaked and the tribes of the earth have lamented, save whom God hath willed, the Expounder of this wondrous exposition.</p>

<p>O My loved ones! Hear ye My call and then aid Me through wisdom and utterance. This is what hath been commanded unto you in the Tablets of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Today there hath appeared from the shell of the ocean of utterance of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the pearl of divine knowledge, and it is this: O people of Baha! Know ye the station of these days and then assist Him with the hosts of deeds and character. This is what ye were commanded aforetime and in this perspicuous Tablet. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet the people are in grievous doubt. Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One. He remembereth thee with that which the remembrances of the world cannot equal. To this beareth witness the Lord of Eternity Who calleth out before the faces of the world: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds!” Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God and follow not the desires of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. By God! The Most Great Path hath appeared and the Great Announcement calleth and summoneth all unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. When thou art warmed by the heat of My utterance and attracted by the cooing of the Dove of My Paradise, say: “My God, my God! I testify that Thy proof hath encompassed all things, and Thy evidence and Thy testimony have appeared, and the ocean of Thy knowledge hath surged, and the sun of Thy wisdom hath shone forth. I beseech Thee by the hidden mysteries in Thy Books to assist this servant of Thine to be steadfast in Thy love in such wise that neither the clamor of Thy servants nor the whisperings of the divines of Thy land shall prevent him. O my Lord! Ordain for me through Thy bounty that which shall remind me of Thee in all conditions and draw me near unto Thee, O my Exalted Lord. Then accept from me, O my God, what I have wrought in Thy path and accept me unto Thy horizon. Then strengthen me, O my God, to take hold of Thy Book with a power that the might of the mighty cannot weaken nor the ascendancy of the rulers enfeeble. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.”</p>

O thou who gazest upon the Countenance, hear My call from the precincts of the Prison, that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Know thou that the polytheists drove forth the Youth from the City of Mystery with manifest tyranny, and its inhabitants of every creed lamented over Us. Thus was the matter decreed, and We had forewarned of this in a Tablet of mighty glory which We sent to Iraq. Verily thy Lord is cognizant of all things. Yet the Youth went forth adorned with the ornament of thy Lord, in such wise that the Most Great Name became renowned throughout the realms that were attributed to the Son, until We reached the shore of a mighty sea. Then did the Most Great Sea take its place upon the Ark with manifest sovereignty, until We arrived in this land through that which the hands of the hypocrites had wrought. But know thou and be assured that the calamities in the path of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Great, do not dismay Us, nor can the winds of tribulations extinguish this Lamp from which the heavens and earth are illumined. Grieve not for what hath befallen Us. Say: By God! Calamities prevent Him not from His Cause, nor do tribulations hold back His sovereignty. Should all who are in the heavens and earth assemble against Him with drawn swords and piercing spears, He would still speak forth and proclaim: “Verily, I am the Beauty of God amongst all worlds, and neither your swords harm Me nor your spears dismay Me, and I yearn in the path of God for that which none before Me hath borne.” Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Arise to promote the Cause, then summon the people unto it. God will soon reward thee with the best of rewards. He is with thee, and He is the best of helpers. Convey My remembrance to My loved ones there, that the fire of the love of thy Lord may be kindled in their hearts and their covenant in this luminous Cause be renewed.

Blessed art thou in that thou hast conveyed the Cause of thy Lord and attained unto that which was the purpose in the Scriptures and Tablets. All this is from God’s favor upon thee. Be thou thankful unto Him at morn and eventide. We have sent down unto thee various Tablets, each one of which testifieth to that which the Tongue of Grandeur doth speak forth at this time, which God hath made the Dayspring of Days. Read them time and again, that thou mayest be assured that He heareth what thou didst speak forth and seeth thee in all conditions. Wert thou to become aware of what hath been ordained for thee, such joy would seize thee that thou wouldst soar upon the wings of longing and yearning unto the Mighty, the Bestower. It behooveth everyone who hath believed in God to recognize thy rank and station and to seek thy good pleasure for love of God, the One, the Chosen. Look not upon creation and its ways, but rather upon the Truth and His favors which have encompassed the horizons. Thou art indeed he who was mentioned before the Throne and unto whom was oriented the face of God, the Lord of all beings. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee.

Had humanity possessed true vision, the outward acts of the Truth amidst His enemies would have sufficed them all, and they would have beheld the Standard of Truth encompassing all. The Name “the Concealer” hath become the cause of the people’s being veiled from the Truth, to such an extent have the influences of this Name encompassed them that most of the people have deemed themselves learned and the Truth ignorant. How evil is that which they imagine and suppose! Gird up the loins of service and be not neglectful in the Cause of God. Forbid the people from begging in the name of the Truth, and be occupied at all times with teaching the Cause.

<p>O Javad, O Dhakir, O thou who gazest! We have heard thy call and hearkened unto thy cry, thy lamentation and thy plaintive voice. The whole world hath been created specially for this Most Great Revelation. If souls would awaken from the wine of heedlessness and hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names which is raised from the most exalted horizon, thou wouldst now behold all who dwell on earth whole and sound, mighty and powerful, detached and free. They have turned away from the Will of God and cling to, hold fast to, and move according to their own desires. Were all who dwell on earth to turn for half an hour with perfect certitude, detachment and assurance toward God - exalted be His glory - not a single soul would find himself sorrowful even for less than that period, much less for longer. And God - exalted be His grandeur and glory - would manifest Himself and shine forth each day with a new revelation and wondrous, sublime manifestations. They hearkened not to the counsel of the true Counselor but remained occupied with their own desires. Thus did the Sun of grace remain hidden behind the clouds and the darkness of unseemly deeds encompassed the world. O Javad! By the life of God, thy lamentation brought grief and thy plaintive cry increased the lamentation of the Wronged One. God willing, thou shalt attain unto this blessed Tablet and be blessed with such joy that the tribulations of the world shall not make thee sorrowful, and in all conditions thou shalt remain content and thankful, uttering “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds.” Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who act according to that which they have been commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great.</p>

Today the ocean of generosity is surging and the effulgences of the Sun of bounty have encompassed all existence.

The Son of Mary - upon Him be the peace of God and the peace of His Prophets - observed a fisherman engaged in catching fish. He said: “Put down thy net and come, that I may make thee a fisher of men.” After this word, the tongue-tied gained speech, the ignorant entered the ocean of knowledge, the poor found their way to the kingdom of wealth, the lowly aspired to the summit of glory, the wayward became illumined by the light of the dawn of guidance. For he had passed beyond himself and joined with the Truth. He burned his desires in the fire of love and rent asunder the veils with the finger of certitude.

But the enemies have become a barrier, preventing the letters from the Word, and the Word from the Book, and the fruit from the Tree, and continue to do so.

<p>He is the Witness from the horizon of heaven</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Husayn! We bear witness that thou hast attained the presence of the Wronged One twice. He it is Who aided thee, caused thee to know Him, and brought thee before His face, and cast upon thee that which, were it to be cast upon the mountains, they would take flight by God’s leave, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High; and were it cast upon the earth, it would transform it instantly into heaven; and were it cast upon a star, it would make it a sun shining from the horizon of this Tablet, from which the fragrance of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all creation. I bear witness that thou hast attained to that which hath been the hope of them that are nigh unto God from all eternity. Thou didst seek the divine court and attain the presence of the Wronged One in a place named the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the nations who were heedless of the Cause and cast the Covenant behind their backs had wrought. When the wine of My utterance from the direction of My prison did intoxicate thee, say: “My God, my God! Would that I had a thousand souls to spend in Thy path, and a thousand lives to sacrifice in Thy love! I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art remembered in hearts, to assist me to serve Thy Cause, to make mention of Thee, and to praise Thee amongst Thy creatures. Alas, alas! I know not what Thou hast written for Thy servant who hath clung to the cord of Thy bounty and held fast to the hem of the robe of Thy mercy. I know not, O my Best-Beloved, what Thou hast ordained for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen. If Thou hast ordained faithfulness for me, then shall I render thanks with my self, my soul, my essence and my temple; and if Thou hast deprived me of this bounty, then woe unto me, and again woe unto me! By Thy glory, at this moment weeping preventeth me from making mention of Thee, O Lord of all being! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy utterance and the lights of Thy countenance to make me one of them who choose not for themselves aught save what Thou hast ordained for them through Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Kind.”</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His glory! The grace and bounties be upon you, O My Baha! We testify that We have mentioned you before with verses from which shone forth from the horizon of each letter the sun of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. By God’s life! In every word of your Lord’s words surged the ocean of realities and meanings, yet the people remain in evident remoteness. We have desired at this time to adorn your head once again with the crown of your Lord’s loving-kindness, and your temple with the ornament of the Most Great Steadfastness in this Mighty Announcement. Nabil, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, mentioned you before the Throne and presented it to My Branch Diya. We have turned toward you and sent down for you from the Mother Book this mighty and wondrous Book. It has grieved Me what befell you in your departure from the Land of Ta and your arrival in the land which God has made the Dawning-place of His verses that hold sway over all who are in the heavens and the earth.

Repeatedly hast thou been enabled to make mention of the Most Great Name and the Wronged One of the world, and been assisted to offer praise and thanksgiving to the Lord of eternity and the Beloved of all nations. All people, after striving, are deprived, and after seeking, are forbidden, save whom God willeth. All things in the world, with their diverse objects and ornate treasures, cannot and will never equal one word of the sublime Words. God willing, thou shalt be enabled to achieve that which is acceptable at the Divine Threshold. Strive thou to discover the fragrance of the Word and to become detached and free from aught else but God. His honor Aqa Ghulam-’Ali mentioned thee in the Most Holy Presence through this servant who is present, wherefore this Tablet was revealed and sent. O ’Ali! Strive thou that the dawning-places of love may seek thee out and gather round about thee. It is beloved that thou be called, in the presence of the Face, the father of mankind. Know thou that which the tongue of the Wronged One hath spoken, and be of them that act. We beseech God to assist thee in that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Make the Word of God, which all must obey, thy highest goal, thy most exalted hope, thy purpose and aim, thy beloved one, thine heir, and thy wealth. O ’Ali! Strive thou to attain unto this station. Turn thou with thy whole being, then act according to that whereby the near ones perceive the fragrance of thy Lord’s good-pleasure, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Convey My greetings to thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My acceptance of what she hath sent time and again.

<p>O ’Ali, O Akbar! Thou hast mentioned the opposers in the land of ?ad. The world is in upheaval. The Pharaohs of the past have been resurrected. Dawlatabadi and his followers have become afflicted with delusions that have had and have no equal. The Shi’ih party stands in the first rank with that party. It is not known to what they cling, to what they turn, and from what they turn away. By the life of God, they have been and are worshippers of idle fancies and names. The former party arranged for themselves lords equal to the numerical value of the name Javad, yet they still counted themselves as believers in unity. Your honor hath not fallen short in service, mention and teaching, but heedless souls are not susceptible to guidance. Now there exist the equivalent of all the books, nay more, yet they have said what they have said. They have passed over the station wherein the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - declared “Verily I am the first of the worshippers,” and have clung to a station of which they have not been and are not aware. Would that the people knew who exalted Him and who mentioned Him! The requirements of wisdom in those days, for the protection of the Source of the Cause from God, were manifest. After the rending of veils, endless hardships, writing through nights and days, and arising before the faces of all people, veils thicker than before are seen to have appeared and become barriers. It behooveth thee to beseech God to purify the ears for hearkening unto what hath been revealed from His presence, and the eyes for beholding His signs. Verily He is powerful over all things. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the loved ones of that land. The light from Our presence be upon thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Praise be to God that from the beginning of days thou hast been occupied with mention and praise and service to the Cause. We beseech God to aid thee and withhold not from thee His assistance and attention, that thou mayest remain occupied as before throughout the rest of thy days and engage in the reformation of the world and the refinement of the souls of the peoples.

Through divine bounty he traversed land and sea and arrived at the shore of the Most Great Ocean - the place from which the Divine Call is raised. Blessed are they whom the affairs of the world have not prevented from the supreme horizon. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land and say: God willing, you must arise to serve the Cause of the Beloved of all possibility with perfect steadfastness and composure, in such wise that neither the power of the mighty nor the hosts of the earth shall prevent you from the Creator of heaven. In one place this good, firm and blessed word was revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance: Some of the friends are observed to be fearful. Of what should they fear, and of whom? This mansion of clay hath no worth, and these earthly temples have no station. Were they to act according to that which was revealed in the Book, they would observe that a fly is more excellent in God’s sight than every heedless learned one and every doubting ruler. Their martyrdom is not so cheap as to fall to the hand of everyone and for every soul to attain unto it. By God’s life! It is a precious gem whose weight and worth none hath known save God, the Distinguisher, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O friends! Know your own worth and relinquish not your stations. Soon that which is mentioned and witnessed shall be concealed, and that which hath been ordained for you shall remain and endure.

He doeth as He willeth. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath appeared in truth is verily the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, the Dayspring of His Cause, and the Manifestation of His Self.

Blessed is he who hath been attracted by the fragrances of My days and drawn nigh unto a station which the All-Merciful hath revealed in a preserved Tablet. Beware lest human conditions prevent you from turning to the Most Great Horizon.

Observe and ponder how He hath taken from His prison. By God! Whosoever looketh with the eye of insight will cry out and say: “Thine is the power and majesty, O Splendor of all who are in the heavens and on earth!” Grieve not for what hath passed. His Cause shall surely come. Thus doth He Who possesseth knowledge of all things inform you in a clear Book. Hold fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness and cling to the hem of My mercy. Then drink the choice wine of utterance from the hands of My bounty. He, verily, is the Munificent, the Generous. He remembereth him who remembereth Him, and turneth unto him who turneth unto Him, and answereth him who raiseth his call in this wondrous Day.

<p>Know thou that, according to what thy Lord, the Lord of all men, hath decreed in His Book, the favors vouchsafed by Him unto mankind have been, and will ever remain, limitless in their range. First and foremost among these favors, which the Almighty hath conferred upon man, is the gift of understanding. His purpose in conferring such a gift is none other except to enable His creature to know and recognize the one true God - exalted be His glory. This gift giveth man the power to discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is right, and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation. Next in rank, is the power of vision, the chief instrument whereby his understanding can function. The senses of hearing, of the heart, and the like, are similarly to be reckoned among the gifts with which the human body is endowed. Immeasurably exalted is the Almighty Who hath created these powers, and revealed them in the body of man.</p>
<p>Every one of these gifts is an undoubted evidence of the majesty, the power, the ascendancy, the all-embracing knowledge of the one true God - exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>Consider the sense of touch. Witness how its power hath spread itself over the entire human body.</p>
<p>Whereas the faculties of sight and of hearing are each localized in a particular center, the sense of touch embraceth the whole human frame. Glorified be His power, magnified be His sovereignty!</p>
<p>These gifts are inherent in man himself. That which is preeminent above all other gifts, is incorruptible in nature, and pertaineth to God Himself, is the gift of Divine Revelation. Every bounty conferred by the Creator upon man, be it material or spiritual, is subservient unto this. It is, in its essence, and will ever so remain, the Bread which cometh down from Heaven. It is God’s supreme testimony, the clearest evidence of His truth, the sign of His consummate bounty, the token of His all-encompassing mercy, the proof of His most loving providence, the symbol of His most perfect grace. He hath, indeed, partaken of this highest gift of God who hath recognized His Manifestation in this Day.</p>
<p>Render thanks unto thy Lord for having vouchsafed unto thee so great a bounty. Lift up thy voice and say: All praise be to Thee, O Thou, the Desire of every understanding heart!</p>

Whatsoever existeth in the world and is possessed by the people of the world is perishable, except what God willeth. That which is adorned with the ornament of immortality is a remembrance that floweth from the Supreme Pen - this endureth as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. All are assured with manifest certainty of the transience of the world and its vicissitudes. Nevertheless, they have clung to it in such wise that they remain heedless and veiled from God and from that which is with Him. Blessed is thy father! At the time of his ascension We perceived from him the fragrance of My love, to which the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise in the All-Glorious Companion bear witness. By the life of God! Were the recompense for deeds performed in the path of God to become manifest on earth, all would turn toward the Friend and would be detached and freed from aught else. Be not grieved by that which hath come to pass. Hold fast unto patience - for patience hath a great reward with God, the Lord of all worlds. Upon thee be glory, and upon those who have attained unto the days of God and have hearkened unto that which hath been sent down from Him - they are among those who are nigh in a perspicuous Book. On behalf of the Wronged One, make mention of the relatives and remind them of that which beseemeth them, for the station of the servants hath ever been that of submission. Were man to observe with the eye of truth, he would testify that whatsoever cometh to pass is pure good.

Verily He is the Protector of humanity and the Lord of the world to come and the world that was. We send Our greetings to the family of him who hath ascended, and We make mention of each of them with a goodly remembrance. Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

Praise be to God that thou hast been singled out for His special favors. Thou hast traversed the path and attained to that which hath been ordained in the Book by the Pen of God. What hath befallen thee through God’s decree and destiny hath truly grieved Me. I beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn thee with beautiful patience and mighty fortitude. The world hath ever been the abode of tribulations and calamities, but since it is transient, sorrow is unwarranted, for everlasting divine blessings and infinite mercies are ordained. Fix your gaze upon this blessed verse which hath been sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will in the Qur’an: “Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world: but good deeds, the fruit whereof endureth forever, are of more merit with thy Lord as a hope, and of more merit as an object of reliance.” This year there befell this Wronged One what hath befallen no one else, for they have sullied the hem of sanctity with the calumnies of heedless and lying souls. It is clear and evident to all what was the bounty, what was the favor, and what was the ingratitude and rebellion. In all circumstances We beseech God to assist that honored leaf of the Lote-Tree to remain steadfast in her devotion and to do that which beseemeth His days. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among the leaves and handmaidens of God, and upon His kindred whom neither the vicissitudes of the world deterred from the Lord of mankind nor the might of rulers frightened in this Most Great Announcement and His firm and mighty Cause.</p>

We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee to remember and praise Him, and to protect thee from every remote oppressor. Verily the Cause is in His hands - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.

Light belongs to God, glory belongs to God, authority belongs to God, splendor belongs to God, and power belongs to God! He is the One Who, through His Most Exalted Word, guided those on earth from sheer heedlessness to the horizon of awareness and led them to the shore of the ocean of knowledge. His Word is the greatest elixir for the transformation of contingent beings and the elevation of the realities of existing things. Exalted be His sovereignty, exalted be His power, exalted be His dominion, and mighty be His proof! O Ali, upon thee be My glory! My Name Ali-Before-Akbar forwarded thy letter and petition to the Divine Presence and the Source of heavenly outpourings. It was honored with His gaze and attention. At this moment, one of the Branches of the Blessed Tree, His Holiness Diya, is present before Us. We have commanded him to pen this Tablet, from whose horizon’s heaven hath shone forth the light of God’s mercy, the Lord of the worlds. Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid thee and His loved ones to that which will cause His Cause to be exalted amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. We counsel thee and My loved ones to trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness and purity. Verily thy Lord is He Who speaketh in His Most Mighty, Most Glorious Name amongst mankind. O Ali, convey greetings from this Wronged One to Mahdi. We have mentioned him before with verses that no remembrances can equal. Say: Be not grieved by the world’s events, its hardship, its constraints, and its bounties. We beseech God to open before thy face the gates of grace and bestowal.

<p>O My servant Husayn, who was formerly known as ’Abd! This is a day wherein all the loved ones should turn their gaze toward the All-Bestowing Lord and arise to serve the Cause of God. Ponder with keen vision and a sensitive heart upon the Cause of this Prisoner. By God! Were anyone to reflect upon Him and what hath been manifested from Him of the evidences of His sovereignty and power, and the signs of His wisdom and His commandments, he would surely rise up amidst all created things and cry out: “I testify that nothing like unto Thee hath appeared in creation, nor any resemblance to Thee in invention. Thou art He Who hath manifested God’s sovereignty and power, and through Thee were raised the banners of guidance among all creatures. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.”</p>
<p>Observe how, despite being afflicted with countless tribulations in the Most Great Prison, the Supreme Pen is at all times engaged in the remembrance of the Lord of all names and moving in accordance with His will. In like manner must accepted souls arise with their whole being to serve the Cause and bestow upon God’s servants the flowing waters of divine knowledge which stream from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance, that all may attain unto eternal life and be freed from the garments of the old creation, turning without veil or hindrance toward the countenance of Truth. This is the duty of all.</p>
<p>O My servant Husayn! Hearken with thine inner ear unto the divine call, and cause thy will and desire to be extinguished in His will and desire - that is, desire naught save that which He hath desired. God hath forgiven what is past. Thou must henceforth, God willing, act in accordance with that which thou hast been commanded and be the cup-bearer of this immortal wine. This is the most great bounty which hath flowed forth from the ancient ocean. Drink thou therefrom and be of the thankful ones.</p>

Associate not with Me any partner, nor take unto thyself a protector other than Me. This is better for thee than all that hath been and shall be. Hold fast unto My strong cord, then drink from the choice wine of My Most Glorious Name, whose seal We have broken through My sovereignty and power. Thus have We sent down the command in a preserved tablet. Turn thine ear toward the Throne, then hearken unto what the Tongue of Revelation speaketh. Verily He saith: These are My days; seize ye their worth. By My life! He who hath recognized their value and tasted of their sweetness hath soared in the atmosphere of My Most Glorious Name on two wings of faithfulness, and hath seen all creation behind him. Such a one is worthy to be associated with Us. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Be thou steadfast in such wise that the whisperings of them that have turned away from the remembrance of their Lord shall not cause thee to slip. Verily they understand not. Say: Are ye secure from God’s chastisement, or have ye been guaranteed eternal life in this world? Soon shall the breaths of punishment seize you, then shall ye find no helper. Say: O people, cast away what ye possess and take what ye are commanded by God, the Mighty, the Beloved. See ye any protector besides Me? Nay, by My Self, if ye but knew. The Hour hath come, yet ye turn away from it. The Awakening hath appeared, yet ye remain heedless of it. The earthquake hath seized all who are on earth save those who have come unto the All-Merciful after drinking the cup of assurance. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses, but the people perceive not. Be thou assured through God’s grace and mercy, then make thy remembrance My remembrance, thy purpose My good-pleasure, thy hope My favor, thy path My path, thy beloved My beautiful praise, and say: Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>

Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Beauty, through whose manifestation the dwellers of the Supreme Paradise rejoiced, and the denizens of the crimson seas in their most exalted retreats were gladdened by its presence, and the Maids of Heaven in the All-Highest Paradise were blessed by its beauty at the Ultimate Lote-Tree, and through which those at Sinai fell unconscious upon the dust of self and passion, and the skin of the sincere ones trembled in the wilderness of fancy and blindness - to preserve us, O my God, from all else but Thee, and purify our hearts from the mention of aught save Thee. Then make us steadfast in Thy love and Cause, and attract us through the sweet-scented breezes of Thy holy favors and bounties. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Then preserve us, O my God, from the whisperings of Satan who warred against the Beauty of the All-Merciful and turned away from the Countenance of Glory and was among the heedless concerning the Paradise of the Cause.

Know then, O Sultan, that We dwelt among the people as one of them, such that We would sit with them and walk before them morning and evening, and none among them recognized Us, for they were seized with vain imaginings and were drowned in the ocean of fancy. When the days were fulfilled and the promise came, We emerged from behind the veils with manifest power and rent asunder the veils of fancy and showed forth Our countenance from this Dawn which was radiant from the horizon of God. Thus do We cast upon thee the verses and manifest unto thee the Cause that thou mayest become aware of that which God hath concealed from the eyes of the world. Know then that missives and tablets were presented before Us and We found no trace from thee among them, and We became inwardly grieved. Change thy habit, then cast upon the Tablet that which the Spirit casts into thy heart, then present it before Us through a trustworthy messenger.

<p>O Mahmud! In the name of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised! O Mahmud! Praise thy Lord and be praiseworthy in His Cause, that all things may testify to thy turning unto God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through the power of thy Lord, then cross over the bridge through the might of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Should anyone prevent thee, say: “O Satan! By what proof didst thou turn away from the mention of the name of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and by what evidence didst thou believe in God, the Mighty, the Beloved?” Be fair within thyself, then bring thyself into the presence of God. If thou deniest this Most Great Revelation, by what proof can thy faith be established and thy soul find rest? Nay, by Him Who created all things between the Kaf and the Nun! Don thou the robe of certitude and arise to warn the servants of the great terror, saying: “Have mercy upon yourselves and be not of those who differ among themselves.” This is He Who was promised to you by the tongue of Ali aforetime, as witnessed by praising servants. Beware lest ye be negligent in the Cause of God and cast the Most Great Word behind your backs. Fear ye the Day when all shall be brought before Him. Break not God’s Covenant, nor set aside His Book, nor take the book of those whose unbelief is attested by the Concourse on High and those who rejoice in the Garden of Paradise. Sanctify thyself from the insinuations of those who oppose God and shun them as thou wouldst shun the plague. God sufficeth thee. He is with thee and will aid those who walk in the paths of His good-pleasure and who rejoice in His remembrance. Thus doth the Youth command thee out of love for thee, that He may draw thee nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Kind. And mercy be upon thee shouldst thou inhale the fragrance of the Beloved from this Missive that hath been sent.</p>

<p>O Hadi! Hearken unto the call of God from the Lote-Tree of Baha: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Subduing, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. I counsel thee, O My Name, with that which We have counseled in the Psalms and Tablets. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord in such wise that thou hearest not from anyone on earth that which is contrary to the command of thy Lord - turn away from it and turn unto God, the Revealer of verses. The foolish one hath been seized with such pride that he openly uttereth that which [is cursed by] all things. By God! My heart hath grieved thereby, and the hearts of those who have turned towards the Countenance in these days wherein feet have slipped. Associate not with him; rather turn away from him through the sovereignty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Be as fire to the enemies of God and as light to His loved ones. Thus hath the decisive Word been set forth in the Book. Walk thou in the footsteps of thy Lord. Fear not those who speak according to their desires - they are verily of the wolves. Burn with the fire of the Word the heart of every polytheist and doubter. Be thou so steadfast that the words of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of Lords, grieve thee not. Grieve not - thou art with Me and beneath the canopy of My greatness. Put thy trust in God, then detach thyself from every denier and deceiver, and be not a helper to one who hath denied the Countenance. Thus have We sent down the command from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. To assist the people of tyranny is in no wise permissible, for this would harm the very root of the Tree. In all the Books this decree hath been revealed. In the Qur’an He saith: “Lean not towards those who do wrong.” God willing, thou must engage in the triumph of the Cause with utmost power, detached from everyone possessed of manifest rancor.</p>

<p>The Most Great, the Most Glorious! We, verily, remember from within this prison the loved ones of God, that they may remain steadfast in this Cause on this wondrous Day and make mention of God in such wise that all faces may turn towards the Almighty, the All-Wise. From the right hand hath been raised the call of God, and from another direction the fragrance of His garment hath wafted over all creation. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Say: Verily it shall perish, while the Cause remaineth with God, your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O people! I am the Manifestation of God amongst you, and His proof amidst you, and His sovereignty unto you, were ye to be of them that know. Beware lest ye deny Him through Whom the sun hath shone forth and the moon hath appeared in this heaven which hath been raised up through this Great Name. Cast behind you all created things, turning unto the Dayspring of the signs of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus have We adorned the horizon of utterance with this remembrance through which the hearts of them that know have been illumined. O Rahim! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, from the precincts of the prison - there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Arise to make mention and say: O people! The Day hath come and the call hath been raised betwixt earth and heaven. The Lord of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty. Beware lest anything withhold you from Him through Whom the power of God was revealed and His sovereignty encompassed all things great and small. They who have believed in the Unseen and in Him Who speaketh the truth are indeed on a straight path. Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation before the completion of a full thousand years, such a one is assuredly a lying impostor. And whoso interpreteth this verse otherwise is of them that are lost. Thus do We instruct thee and teach thee of Our grace, that thou mayest make mention of thy Lord and be of them that are thankful.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Peerless Beloved! May you ever be illumined with the lights of the morn of inner meanings and be vocal in the praise and glorification of God, in such wise that the choice wine of remembrance and utterance may attract all beings and draw them to the divine realm. Today is the day of service, and whatsoever appeareth therefrom shall endure as long as God’s most beauteous names endure. Cultivate barren land–that is, heedless hearts–with the water of divine wisdom, that the ears of divine knowledge may spring forth therefrom. In this Most Great Revelation all are enjoined to wisdom, lest there appear that which would cause perturbation of hearts and aversion of souls. This hath been due to God’s all-embracing mercy, for verily His mercy hath preceded all things and His grace hath encompassed the worlds. Some time ago Nabil, upon him be the Glory of God, attained the Most Holy Presence, and a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent from the heaven of the Divine Will specifically for each of you. Therefore, this time this Tablet sufficeth. Praise be to God, ye are mentioned in Our presence. God willing, through divine favor and the fragrance of His celestial Robe, ye shall quicken and perpetuate ephemeral beings. This is the king of deeds. Blessed is he who achieveth it! In truth, regret and remorse belong to those souls who have not recognized the Day of God and from whom no deed hath appeared that would cause the perpetuation of being. Arise to accomplish God’s Cause and His sovereignty, then quicken the people through this choice wine, whose seal hath been broken by the finger of the Will of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Verily, the Glory be upon you and upon those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Supreme Horizon and whose hearts have been illumined by this Luminary through which the heavens and earth have been made to shine.</p>

<p>The first salutation that was uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur ere the creation of earth and heaven be upon thee, O thou Name Ha’, thou who shinest above the horizon of fidelity. I testify that thou didst direct thyself towards God; didst hear the Call; didst answer “Yea!” unto the Possessor of all Names; and wast so transported by the rapture born of the Divine Verses that thou didst offer up thine all, thy family and thy spirit, in the path of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>There hath befallen you in the path of God that which hath not befallen anyone in the Dispensation of the Bayan. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of oneness that this supreme affliction hath appeared for naught save the exaltation, elevation and manifestation of that which the Twin Shining Stars, that is Hasan and Husayn, exemplified. Blessed is the condition of the land that became the resting place of those two temples, and the state of those souls who, purely for the sake of God, drew nigh and attained unto their visitation. O leaf! Every abasement encountered in the path of Truth is the sovereign of all glory, and every hardship endured in the way of the Friend is the king of all ease. Though in these days the eyes of the heedless souls are veiled by the veils of vain desires from beholding the Truth and Its manifestations, the time shall come when they shall wail and lament for what hath escaped them. Soon shall the fruits of the deeds of the oppressors become manifest and evident. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In all conditions fix your gaze upon the Truth and hold fast to the cord of His grace. Verily He comforteth you and consoleth you. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. The glory be upon thee and upon those who were martyred in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>O Mirza Aqa! He is the Most Wondrous, the Wondrous, the Glorious, the All-Glorious! O beloved of the age! God was, and there was nothing besides Him. Soon thou shalt find remoteness even as it was before, as We have informed thee of this in the Holy Tablet a year before the Luminary of the horizons departed from Iraq - and thou art of them that know. These are days wherein all have taken their vain desires as their god and dust as the Lord of Lords. In such circumstances, whom should the Pen mention and by what merit should the Tongue of Grandeur sing? Leave them to their vain disputes. Yet be not grieved, for verily God, glorified be His majesty, hath behind the pavilions of infallibility servants whom neither the cawing of the raven nor the croaking of the profligate deter. They regard all who are in the heavens as non-existent and hasten with steadfast feet and trustworthy hearts to the court of their Goal. However, in teaching the Cause, persistence is necessary. This is Our duty and yours, but God doeth whatsoever He willeth. Although the cry of the polytheists is raised to such heights that the voice of the monotheists cannot be heard, save by him who hath a penetrating ear, consider the hollow drums: though inwardly empty and bereft of the wondrous tokens of divine mercy, their noise and clamor outwardly deafen the world. How excellent is this similitude We have struck for thee, that thou mayest be of them that understand! In any case, with such a discordant sound it is difficult for the Most Great Remembrance to reach the ears. All these degrees pertain to the limitations of the human world; otherwise, were the divine melody to appear even less than what can be counted, it would encompass all worlds. And praise be unto this Lord, for verily He is the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Today all souls are seen to be perishing and evanescent save those who have turned with radiant faces toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Give thanks to the Beloved of the world that you have attained to His recognition and were not prevented from the Ancient Beauty by the clamor of the nations. You have rent asunder the veils and, by God’s might and power, have shattered the idol of vain imagination and reached the supreme heights which are the station of absolute certitude. Today the clouds of vain desires of heedless souls have become an obstacle and prevented people from the Horizon of Divine Unity. Had they but known, they would have cast away all they possess and hastened with their hearts unto God, the Lord of the worlds. You must all drink from the seas of joy and soar with the wings of gladness, for most of the people of the world remain veiled while you have turned toward the Friend and each of your names has been presented in the Most Holy Presence and has been favored with the glance of this Prisoner’s loving-kindness, and from the Supreme Pen this most wondrous Tablet has been revealed. Blessed are you for having attained unto the days of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. We have adorned the head of your letter with the crown of My mention, the Sovereign over all the worlds. From this spot We send Our greetings upon you and upon those women who have believed in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Thy obedience to God’s command has not been and will never be forgotten from His sight, and has been recorded by the Pen of His Cause in the divine Books. Well is it with thee for having attained this supreme triumph. Remember all the chosen ones with the remembrance of the Chosen One, convey to all the greetings of the Wronged One, and counsel all to manifest spiritual qualities and praiseworthy attributes acceptable before the Wronged One, that they may arise to perform deeds that please Him and cause people to turn towards the Friend. Trustworthiness and truthfulness are two garments adorned with the ornament of honor and acceptance. God willing, all must appear with perfect trustworthiness and speak with truthfulness, arising to serve God through their deeds. The manifestation of these qualities has been and ever shall be the cause of the exaltation of God’s Word, while their absence is the cause of the veiling of humanity, as is evident. Should anyone manifest any unacceptable deed, people attribute it to the root of the Tree. God protect us and you from this. The world has had and shall have no worth. The purpose is that the divine attributes should be manifested through each of God’s loved ones among humanity, that all may be drawn by that brilliant lamp to the Dawning-Place of Revelation and turn towards it. Be thou engaged in the remembrance of God with the utmost joy and delight, for His grace has been and shall ever be with thee.

<p>In the name of the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing One. O son of Dhabih, who has attained the presence of God! These are the days of manifestation, and the Sun of loving-kindness is shining, and the ocean of generosity is surging. Therefore, the mention of those souls who have turned towards Him has flowed and continues to flow from the Supreme Pen. This Day a door is open wider than both heaven and earth. The eye of the mercy of Him Who is the Desire of the worlds is turned towards all men. An act, however infinitesimal, is, when viewed in the mirror of the knowledge of God, mightier than a mountain. Every drop proffered in His path is as the sea in that mirror. For this is the Day which the one true God, glorified be He, hath announced in all His Books, unto His Prophets and His Messengers. Were the greatness of this Day to be revealed in its fullness, most men would swoon away and fall prostrate. Nevertheless, the station of each one is clear and evident. It is hoped that through these torrential rains now falling, there may spring forth from the soil of men’s hearts that which is worthy. Ask ye of God to strengthen His loved ones to preserve that which He hath bestowed, lest vain imaginings and improper deeds and actions change it. Dhabih and his kin have been and continue to be mentioned in the presence of God. Be ye thankful unto God for this mighty favor. O youth! Hold fast with all thy strength to the hem of the grace of thy Lord in such wise that no earthly power can weaken it. Thus doth God counsel thee from the precincts of His mighty prison. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and My tender care and My loving-kindness, and be thou of the thankful ones.

All things bear witness that the Pen of the Ancient has been and is, night and day, occupied with the remembrance of the loved ones of God. Oceans of God’s loving-kindness have streamed and been sent down from the Pen, yet the people of the earth remain heedless and occupied with their own vain imaginings. They have regarded the Dawning-Place of light as darkness and deemed the Ocean of knowledge as ignorant.

Today each one of the loved ones of God should be occupied with some pursuit whereby, in the course of their trade, they might be able to convey a word of truth to some soul and deposit a seed of divine love in the hearts of men.

O ’Ali!

Thus did it befall Me, and We have mentioned unto thee a letter thereof that thou mayest be clear-sighted regarding the Cause of thy Lord and remain steadfast in His help and the exaltation of His Cause at all times.

When asked “By what proof do you cling to him?” they say “Because his name was mentioned.” Say: If We were to accept this from you, why then did you turn away from the One Mentioned? We revealed in the Bayan: “Be not veiled by names from Him Who shall come with the truth.” Read it that you may know. You turned away from Him concerning Whom the Bayan was revealed, and clung to one whom you knew not. They are indeed a people in loss. That which was revealed in the Bayan circles round Me while you perceive not. Fear God and dispute not with Him but for Whom the sun of revelation would not have shone from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Is there anyone with sight in creation who might behold what hath appeared, or with hearing who might hear what hath been revealed in this Revelation?

<p>O Mirza Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God! In the Name of the Possessor of the World!</p>
<p>All the peoples and religions were promised this Most Great Day, which in the divine Books is known as the Day of God. When the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of His Manifestation, some turned away and others arose in opposition. They preferred conjecture to certitude and chose darkness over light. This is not the first Cause that hath appeared in the world. Consider the former ages and reflect: in every age and epoch when the divine Light shone forth from the heaven of God’s Will, the leaders and divines of that age strove with utmost effort to extinguish that Light. To this day the traces of the oppressors’ tyranny are visible in the earth and recorded in the Book. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized the station of this Day and acted as beseemeth it. Glory be to God! These heedless people have preferred extinction to immortality and regarded the ignorant as learned. Today the Balance is manifest and speaketh with the most exalted utterance. It is the true Discriminator and the spiritual Identifier. Yet all are heedless of it and veiled from it, save whom God willeth, the Lord of the worlds. We have mentioned thee before and in this Tablet that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Generous.

<p>In the Name of the one true God! The All-Glorious! God, exalted be His glory, hath created His servants for His recognition. Blessed is the one who hath turned unto Him and attained unto true divine unity, which is the station wherein the Ancient Being is sanctified from all else save Him and His Essence is purified from all things. The abominable Shi’ites have not attained unto this most exalted station and sublime rank, and yet they count themselves among the believers in unity. O friend! The handmaiden of God hath repeatedly mentioned thee, therefore We make mention of thee in this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet. We counsel thee to be trustworthy, religious, truthful and sincere. We beseech God to assist thee in that which leadeth to elevation and is the cause of exaltation. The friends have ever been and continue to be remembered, and for each We seek that which shall cause their name and fame to endure. Say: O my God, my God! I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness. Thou hast no likeness in creation nor any equal in invention. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful. Convey My greetings to the kinswoman. We have mentioned her mother time and again. We mentioned her before and mention her now, and We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect her and ordain for her the good of this world and the next. We make mention of Abdolbaha with such remembrance as will attract the hearts of the righteous. We counsel all to perform good deeds and manifest praiseworthy character. Be not idle like the Babis. Do what God hath revealed in the Book. Peace be upon you and upon God’s righteous servants.</p>

<p>O Haji Rajab-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>In His Name, Who is sanctified above mention and utterance!</p>
<p>Praise be to the peerless Lord Who, through the diver of His absolute Will, hath brought forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the shells of the sea of man. He is the One Who is mighty, Whom neither the veils of the heedless nor the doubts of the opposers have deprived of the lights of the manifestation of the Lord of the worlds. Glorified be His greatness and exalted be His power! There is no God but Him.</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us to him whose name was present before the Countenance and who hath attained unto the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: O people! The Day of God hath appeared and the Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty. Take hold of that which God hath sent down with a power that all the hosts of the earth cannot weaken. To this testifieth the Most Great Book that walketh in the prison and speaketh: “There is no God but I, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>When thou hearest the call from the Most Exalted Horizon, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by the lamp of Thy Cause whereby Thou hast illumined the world, and by Thy most sweet utterance and the most exalted pen to make me one who speaketh of Thy remembrance and who holdeth fast unto Thy cord. Thou art, verily, the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>“O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one drawing nigh unto the ocean of Thy bounty and the sick one unto the Kawthar of Thy healing. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which Thou hast ordained for them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creation. Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>“O my Lord! Deprive me not of the wonders of Thy grace, and make me not to be forbidden and debarred from that which Thou hast ordained for them that are nigh unto Thee and the sincere ones. Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the One powerful through Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed those who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>

<p>He is the Mighty! Praise be unto the Beloved Who cannot be known, Who is worthy and befitting, Who hath created all who are in the heavens and on earth through a single letter from the manifestations proceeding from the Pen, and Who will likewise continue to create unto an end that hath no end. Exalted be His mention above every lofty, sublime and mighty mention, and glorified be He above every perfect and wondrous description. And then, since the letter of that person indicated burning from separation - by God, it behooveth every lover to weep and lament from separation from the Beloved. Patience is praiseworthy except regarding the Beloved, and crying out is blameworthy except regarding the Intended One. However, attraction and yearning and longing appear more strongly in separation and parting, for the sweetness of attainment may possibly extinguish the fire of seeking, as hath happened with some who in this journey have drawn nigh unto nearness and meeting, and have remained wholly veiled. Yea, one who hath been and will ever be sustained by the eternal wine of reunion and hath not grown cold - such a being hath been and will be rarer than red sulphur. However, we hope that you, in the extremity of remoteness, may attain the utmost degree of nearness, and may drink and partake of the cup of the mysteries of God’s Cause which until now hath been concealed from all souls, and may become firmly established and steadfast upon the sacred carpet. All this is from the grace of thy Lord. Tablets have been revealed in these days and mention made of that person, but since no scribe was available to make copies, they were not sent, until we see what divine destiny will require. And peace and the spirit be upon thee and upon those who are with thee.</p>

<p>O handmaiden of God Fatimih! She is remembering and remembered. Praise be to the Beloved Who, through the word “no,” caused all the manifestations of negation to perish, and through the blessed word “except,” guided the manifestations of affirmation to the station of immortality. The polytheists have ever been deprived of the Most Great Scene and forbidden from the Most Pure Fountain. O leaf! Praise God that thou hast grown from the tree of divine love and been sustained by its fragrances. Blessed are those souls who, when the winds of trials blew, were not prevented from the love of the Servant of the All-Merciful and did not withdraw their hands from grasping the cord of His favor. In the blowing of the winds of tests, the manifestations of oneness become distinguished from the dawning-places of polytheism. Claims are not completed through words alone, but are contingent and conditional upon deeds. By God! If life be sacrificed in the path of the Beloved, the name “life” would be truly applicable to it; otherwise it has been and will be but loss. Were the servants to soar to the divine heaven on the wings of detachment and become aware of that which is hidden, all would hasten freely to the place of sacrifice. However, in accordance with consummate wisdom and for the preservation of souls in the world, this station remains concealed and stored in the treasuries of protection. O leaf of the Divine Lote-Tree! Be thou enkindled with the fire of the love of God and regard all as non-existent save those in whose faces thou perceivest the radiance of the Most Glorious from God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Blessed is thy father who remained firm in the Cause in days wherein the feet of the mystics slipped, and blessed be thy mother and those who are in thy household. And the Spirit be upon thee, then Glory be upon thee, then Mercy be upon thee and upon such handmaidens as have believed in God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beloved.</p>

<p>And now, the spiritual beloved Mr.&nbsp;Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], came some time ago and attained the presence. Since he is engaged in commerce in the great city, he has requested that someone be specifically assigned for writing and accounting with him. Therefore, this servant mentions, as commanded, that if your honor is inclined, this matter is very suitable. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make this matter a cause and means for the manifestation and emergence of human dignity and station. And after submitting this before the face of the Lord, He said: “We beseech God to assist His servant Isma’il in what He loves and is pleased with, and to send down upon him from the clouds of His grace a blessing from His presence and from the heaven of His bounty a mercy from His side. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and worthy to answer.” End.</p>

<p>In the days when the foundations of all were disturbed and shaken through the power of oppression, this Wronged One arose to promote the Cause of God - an arising after which no sitting down was seen. Night and day did the tongue speak and the pen write, until the divine Cause was somewhat spread abroad. Then souls who were fearful, agitated and concealed behind a veil came forth with the sword of rejection and made for the truth. The curse of God be upon the wrong-doing people! Now they strive and struggle to lead the weak astray. Soon will this spread to those regions also. We beseech God that He may aid thee in that which is the cause of the Most Great Steadfastness. For twelve hundred years and more the Shi’ih sect counted themselves above all other sects and considered themselves the most exalted of creation. In the end what happened and what became evident was that in the sight of the Lord of creation they were and are like worthless insects, for they martyred with their own hands the One they worshipped and visited upon the friends of God in every land that which tongue and pen are powerless to recount. Now the people of the Bayan are occupied with those same vain imaginings. They have not reflected even this much on what was the outcome of the deeds of the Shi’ihs and what was their fruit. By God’s life! They are accounted as transgressors in the Book of God, the True, the Manifest King. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee. Verily We have been with thee in all conditions. Thy Lord doth witness and behold, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have ordained for thee that which gladdeneth the heart of every one who hath turned towards God. Thy Lord, the All-Knowing, doth testify to this. Convey My greetings to the friends in those regions and remind them on behalf of God of the Most Great Steadfastness.</p>

<p>He is the Beloved! In this hour when the bride of love hath emerged from behind the veil, and the fire of separation hath blazed forth from heart and soul, and cast patience from its throne, as the countenance of the Friend hath been unveiled - we are in separation, yet wagering our lives in hope of union, though even in union there is fear of separation. Nay, in the path of love, separation is sweeter than union, remoteness more precious than nearness, and separation more favored than union. For in union there is fear of separation, while in separation there is hope of union. After every parting comes meeting, and after every perpetuity comes extinction. They have created the world compounded of honey and colocynth. How can the heartless one draw a peaceful breath in this dusty realm of water and clay, or spread the couch of repose? If it offers a sweet draught to the lip, it draws forth a cry of anguish from the soul. Therefore one must not set one’s pure heart upon it, but pass over it like a cloud and soar beyond it like an eagle - neither content with its sweetness nor distressed by its bitterness. One must set one’s heart upon the eternal kingdom and pass beyond the mortal dust, that perchance on spiritual wings one may fly to the divine holy nest, there to sing with wondrous Iraqi melody this song of spiritual glory: We are all drunk with annihilation, We are all the light of glory, We are all the spirit of eternity. O conscious soul, be aware, be aware! As for the rest of this tale, let whoever wishes come to the Friend’s threshold and understand it, until God may grant it and gather all together.</p>

With thine own eyes thou didst behold and with thine own ears thou didst hear that which no eye hath seen nor ear heard. Know thou the worth of this most great bounty and be thou engaged at all times in the remembrance of the All-Merciful. All thy services are known and accepted before God. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity that this word of acceptance is greater in God’s sight than the treasures of earth and heaven. Praise the Ancient Lord that thou hast attained to this most great station. The Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged thy service and accepted what thou didst bear in His path. This mention We have made a treasure for thee in the treasuries of the Tablets of thy Lord, the Guardian over the worlds. Convey greetings from the Prisoner to all the friends and gladden them all with infinite bounties.

<p>O Mirza Mahmud! The Most Holy, Most Great, Most Glorious! A mention from Us to him who made mention before the Throne, that the fragrances of remembrance may stir him to a station wherein he will soar on wings of longing unto God, the Lord of all men. He hath turned unto Him Who turned unto him, and spoken in praise of those who have arisen to aid His Cause throughout the lands. Blessed is he who hath gathered the pearls of inner meanings from their mine and left the words of the people to the people of idle fancies. Happy is he who hath drunk the crimson wine from the white hand, and been so overcome with intoxication as to be detached from all creation. Say: This is the Kawthar of My utterance amongst My creation, and the choice wine of My knowledge for My servants. Blessed is he who hath attained unto it and drunk thereof at the dawning of the light of My Beauty from the horizon of My Face that shineth upon all regions. Think not that those who are heedless of the Cause are other than the people of error. Their deeds shall condemn them, even should they circle round the House and arise at dawn. Say: None hath any protection this Day save he who hasteneth with his heart unto the Dayspring of grace, whereby hearts are assured and eyes are gladdened. Say: O people! By God, the Ultimate Tree calleth out in the kingdom of creation, yet ye remain heedless though ye were created for this sweetest call. To this beareth witness the Lord of creation. How long will ye follow vain desires? Turn ye unto the Countenance of guidance that hath appeared in such wise that the veils of the wicked could not prevent it. Break ye the cup of idle fancy through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, then take ye the chalice of success through the name of the Cleaver of Dawn. Thus have We quickened the bodies of words through the outpourings of the ocean of utterance of thy Lord, Who controlleth the winds. When thou hast attained unto this Tablet and been attracted by the Kawthar of the All-Merciful, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Dawning-Place of praise, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the glory of the heavens and earth.</p>

<p>In My Most Great Name! My remembrance of My servant is, by My life, more excellent than the choicest wine, more beloved than the purest water, more crystalline than the Kawthar of life, and sweeter than any water created in all the worlds. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath sent down this clear remembrance. Is there anyone who recognizeth this most great station? Is there any possessor of sight who beholdeth this luminous horizon? Say: Through My remembrance the Most Great Sea appeared, and through My name the Faithful Spirit was created. Say: Through My call the Call was raised between earth and heaven, and through My will every trustworthy Messenger was sent forth. Through My love the Fire appeared on the Mount, and through My name the Trumpet was blown and the graves arose, were ye of those who know. Through My fire the world was set ablaze, and through My light every sincere and informed one was guided. Through My call every learned one was attracted, and through My word all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck. Blessed is the people who recognized, and every eye that turned to the All-Seeing. Through My movement all created things moved, and through My rising the people arose unto the Lord of the worlds. Through My grief appeared the most great terror, and from My joy the people of Paradise hastened unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. The rock was seized by the rapture of My verses, and creation by the fragrance of My luminous robe. We have manifested Our Self and sent down the verses and informed the servants of what the All-Merciful revealed in the Bayan, that they might turn to Him with radiant hearts and shining faces. But the people heard not what they were commanded, and We found them struck down. He is indeed the All-Informed. Thus hath God sent down for thee that which gladdeneth thy heart and solaceth the eyes of them that know. Remember thy Lord, that perchance the hearts of the heedless may be attracted thereby. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

However, regarding the hope of souls who have turned and their orientation to this direction - We have commanded all people with wisdom, and certainly the attention of known souls will cause agitation and spread of false statements. By My life! He who desires My presence is among those who have attained the presence of My countenance, heard My call, and attained the Kawthar of My meeting and the choice wine of My reunion. Verily from the Most Exalted Pen is written the reward of attainment for whomever desires it. Thy Lord is verily the Powerful, the Mighty. Through this very desire they have attained to this Most Great Remembrance - they must give thanks to their Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. In all matters We have been and are mindful of what benefits the servants themselves, and God is sufficient as witness. Regarding transactions, if you observe any benefit from your going - that is, if rights can be paid according to divine law without any harm occurring - in this case there is and was no objection. And regarding the matter of the name H, do whatever you deem advisable. As he wrote, it is difficult, for here no one is seen who intends to send funds to the land of A and land of M. In any case, do whatever you deem advisable. If you intend to engage in trade and seek profit, in this case request it - there is no objection. The servant in attendance performs one visitation for every letter that arrives from you. God willing, may all be assisted in what befits the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>O Mulla Karim, upon whom be the glory of God! I am the Hearer, the Answerer. Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses and manifested the evidences and called all unto His straight path. Among the people are those whom the wine of the sweetness of utterance hath so enraptured that they have cast away the world and turned unto the Most Great Name, and among them are those who have clung to their desires, turning away from God, the Lord of all men. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken in this glorious and gracious station. Thy letter hath arrived and was presented by the servant who standeth before the Wronged One. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which, were it to be cast upon the barren earth, would cause red roses to spring forth therefrom through the wafting of the breeze of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed art thou for having cast away idle fancies and turned unto God when the learned and the mystics turned away from Him, save those whom God aided as a grace from Him - and He is the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who taught thee the commanding Word of God, acquainted thee with the Balance, guided thee to His path, and gave thee to drink of the Kawthar of knowledge in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Take thou the chalice of eternity in the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of Names, then drink therefrom despite those who have turned away and disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Say: O concourse of the earth! By God, that which was recorded in the Books of God hath appeared, and He Who was promised by the tongue of the Messengers hath come. Cast away what ye possess, then turn ye unto the Most Sublime Horizon, the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God’s, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged and the fragrance of the garment of the All-Merciful been diffused. Blessed is he who hath seen and found, and woe unto the heedless. Rejoice thou in that God hath forgiven thy father and ordained for thee what He desired as a grace from Him - and He is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>

Be thou as a lion in the path of God, such that nothing shall make thee fear in the Cause of thy Lord; rather, let every doubting soul fear thee. Stand firm in the Cause of God and His religion, then aid it with whatsoever thou art able. Verily He aideth whom He willeth through His grace, and He is wise over all things.

Do Thou, then, ordain for them that which Thou didst ordain for Thy chosen ones and for the righteous among Thy creatures, whose constancy in Thy Cause the tempests of trials have failed to shake, and whom the tumults of tests have been powerless to hinder from magnifying Thy most exalted Word–the Word through Which the heavens of men’s idle fancies and vain imaginations have been split asunder.

Cause them, moreover, O my God, to hearken to Thy most sweet voice, that they may all hasten to recognize Thy unity and acknowledge Thy oneness, O Thou Who art the Beloved of the hearts of all that yearn after Thee, and the Object of the adoration of such as have known Thee!</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, by them that have cut down all the idols in this Revelation through which the Most Grievous Convulsion and the Great Terror have appeared, to assist, at all times, Thy servants with the signs of Thine almighty power and the evidences of Thy transcendent and all-compelling might.

O people of names! Do not deprive yourselves from the Dayspring of the Cause, and follow not the vain imaginings of those who were, through justice, debarred from the Ocean of Light.

Your name was present before the Wronged One. We have mentioned you with verses that nothing in existence can equal. Thus did the ocean surge and the fragrance waft through this Name, whereby the limbs of every idolater who was remote from the horizon of nearness did tremble. When the attraction of My choice wine takes hold of you and My call draws you, say: “My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me, and thanks be to Thee for having strengthened me, and glory be to Thee for having guided me.

Then write down for me, through Thy bountiful favors, that which will make me detached from all else save Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty.

God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret, and by Him was the trumpet blast sounded, and all who are in the heavens and earth were struck down, save those whom God rescued by the hand of power. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Blessed art thou, O ’Azim, for having arrived and heard the call of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and for having attained unto that which was inscribed in God’s Scrolls and Books and treasured within the hearts of His Messengers. We beseech God to aid thee and assist thee in serving Him, in remembering Him and praising Him, and to reinforce thee with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Nothing can withhold Him, nor can anything elude His knowledge. He is the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the All-Praised. When thou beholdest the radiance of Baha in his countenance, convey My greetings unto him and remind him of My verses and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and earth. Blessed is ’Ali-Akbar! We bear witness that he turned to God, the Lord of all men, in the earliest days, and rent asunder the veils of glory with the finger of certitude, and shattered the idols of vain imaginings by the command of God, the Lord of all worlds. We, verily, aided him and drew him nigh and taught him and made him know, and showed him My straight path and the Great Announcement. Splendor be upon you and upon those who have attained unto this mighty, this unshakeable Cause.</p>

<p>The holy Countenances are in motion, and the faces of intimacy are in haste, and the doves of paradise are in song, and the maidens of mercy are in melodious chant. In these days when the heavens of attraction have been raised up, and the sun of rapture has risen from the horizon of appearance, and the stars of joy have become manifest, and the moons of might have become radiant - so that the garden of beauty might be adorned with the ornaments of majesty, and the earth of splendor might be spread out upon the throne of the cloud, and the nightingale of gladness might warble with verses of joy upon the branches of the Tree of Sinai, and the leaves of the Tree of Paradise and the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree might come into motion and manifestation - that perchance sanctified souls might be drawn to their original homeland, and purified hearts might circle round and prostrate themselves before the jewels and pure camphor essence in the divine throne of manifestation, that they might taste of the endless bounties and drink from the resplendent fountains of the eyes of grace. Thus have the channels of allusion, like ships in motion, coursed upon the sea of contingent beings, that the countenance of love might become visible from all created things, and the essence of affection might appear within the realities of all mentioned things. O beloved! The heavens of My Being have been raised up for the expansion of thy earth, and the Dove of My Reality hath warbled due to the appearance of attraction in thy inmost heart, that thy essence might rejoice within thy essence and thy heart might find rest within thy heart, that thou mayest remember the people and summon them unto the path of the Living, the Exalted One. Gather the companions and loved ones upon the comprehensive, eternal Word and let them not grow cold or be deprived of the fruits of grace. I remember Mahmud. Convey My greetings to the male and female devotees. A temple in the blessed handwriting was sent.</p>

They have expelled Us from one city and caused Us to enter another, and at the pole of tribulation the Most Exalted Pen proclaimeth between earth and heaven: “The Beloved of the worlds hath been imprisoned. He Who desired to free all who are on earth from the prison of self and passion hath been imprisoned through what the hands of the idolaters have wrought.” Say: Tribulation is as water for that which We have sown in hearts. Soon there shall grow from it ears of corn, each grain whereof shall proclaim: “There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Wise.” Let not the words of those who have denied God grieve thee, nor the deeds of the oppressors. By God! We are in manifest joy and call the servants unto God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. God hath made tribulation a crown for the head of Baha. Through it shall the horizons shine forth, even as We informed you before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is a day wherein that which lay hidden in the breasts of the idolaters is made manifest and the faces of those near unto God shine forth. Arise from the horizon of assurance with the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in such wise as to attract thereby the hearts of those who have advanced. Look not upon the world and what thou seest therein of hardship and prosperity. By My life! All who are therein shall perish, and there shall endure what hath been ordained for thee by One mighty and powerful. Were there any glory in it, the Ancient Beauty would not have remained in this Most Great Prison. By God! Were We to desire it, We could seize the spirits of all who are on earth with but one word from Him. Verily thy Lord hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Be thou a helper to the Cause of thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, that perchance through thee the veil may be removed from the eyes of the heedless. This is the greatest of all deeds in the sight of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most Exalted. He aideth whomsoever He willeth through His command. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

I love tribulation in the path of God, the Creator of all things, even as people love their sight - nay, even more. Your Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, bears witness to this. Soon shall Our sorrow pass away and their joy shall end. Then shall We be in the most exalted station, while they shall be in the lowest fires. Were We to mention the stations of those who have turned to the Countenance, by My life, the pens would be thunderstruck. Do you see any permanence in what they possess, when all things testify to their transience? Take heed, O people of insight! Say: How long will you forsake guidance and follow desire? Open your eyes! Your days are spent, and soon what remains of them shall pass. Hearken to God’s counsel, then turn to Him in spirit and fragrance. Beware lest you take the Evil One as your lord instead of God. Break the idols by the power of your Lord, the Master of all necks. Beware lest you believe him who brings you Satan’s news, for he is among those who have fabricated lies against God, and in whose heart burns the fire of enmity and hatred. Thus has his soul enticed him, and he has turned away from God, the Lord of lords. Purify your faces, then turn with your hearts to the Sacred House. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having guided us to the path of righteousness, for having made Thyself known to us in Thy days, and for having sent down to us in the prison that which brings joy to the eyes of the loved ones. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Glorious Name to make us among those who are steadfast in Thy Cause, whom nothing can deter from turning to Thy Name, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

The Tongue of Grandeur calls them, yet they have cast it behind their backs and turned to every ignorant remote one. Say: Ye were created for this Call. By God!

Say: Is there any doubt about it, or about that which ye possess? Be fair, and be not of the wrongdoers. Every proof hath bowed down before My Cause, and every evidence hath yielded to this manifest and mighty proof. Fear God, and deprive not yourselves of that for which ye were created. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen counsel you, as a favor from Him, if ye be of them that comprehend. Nothing can profit Him nor can any matter harm Him. God hath rendered Him sanctified from all that ye possess. Every discerning one who knoweth beareth witness to this. Beware lest ye follow them who have disbelieved in God and His signs, and turned away from Him unto Whom the Concourse on High, then the Prophets and Messengers have turned. Set your faces toward the Most Remote Prison - verily it is the Sadratul-Muntaha, if ye be of the assured ones.

Blessed is the eye that hath turned to this quarter, and the face that hath turned toward the Face, and the heart that hath turned to God, the Mighty, the Wise.

The Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty!” This is the Day of Remembrance and Utterance, yet the people perceive not. This is the Day wherein the Herald calleth out continually: “Rejoice, O peoples of the earth, for the Most Great Joy hath appeared, inasmuch as the Temple of the Cause hath been established upon the throne of His Name, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>

He who is heedless knoweth not the sweetness of wakefulness, and he whose heart is inscribed knoweth not the delight of effacement. Among men are those who hate the sincere counselor and flee from the agreeable friend. They oppose those who agree with them and deny those who accompany them. They detest those who call them unto God and love those who support them in their desires. They run from the wise to the heedless, and from the learned to the ignorant. They distinguish not between what harmeth them and what profiteth them. They race through the wilderness of error in search of a mirage. Soon shall they find themselves at loss in the end. Many a seeing one whom passion blindeth, many a knower left to wander in error. Doth the wise one boast, knowing he was created from fetid clay? Or doth he glory, while death lurketh behind him?

All created things have borne witness to Thy unity, and every dweller in Thy kingdom hath confessed Thy oneness. The essence of the apprehension of the assured among Thy creatures can never attain unto Thee, and the gem-like utterances with which Thy people have praised and glorified Thee can never hope to ascend unto the atmosphere of Thy holiness. For men’s apprehension of Thee is but the apprehension of Thine own creation; how can it reach up to Thee? And all human praise and glorification of Thee pertain unto Thy servants; how can they be deemed worthy of the court of Thy oneness?</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory! The quintessence of knowledge is powerless to comprehend Thy nature, and the inmost reality of every praise of Thee falleth short of the seat of Thy great glory and of Thine all-compelling power. Every utterance that seeketh to describe Thee, and every knowledge that attempteth to comprehend Thee, is but an expression of Thine own creating, and is begotten by Thy will, and fashioned in conformity with Thy purpose.</p>

Cast me not out of the door of Thy grace, I beseech Thee, and write down for me the recompense destined for him who hath entered Thy presence, and hath risen to serve Thee, and hath been carried away by the drops sprinkled upon him from the Ocean of Thy favors in Thy days, and by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy gifts that have been shed upon him at the revelation of the light of Thy countenance.</p>

The Divine Lote-Tree is aflame, the Fire speaketh, and the Luminary of Manifestation hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of utterance. Yet the people remain veiled and debarred. For one thousand two hundred and more years, the Shi’ih sect counted themselves the noblest, most learned, most excellent and most God-fearing people in the world. But when the touchstone appeared and the horizon of the world was illumined with the lights of His countenance, all the divines and doctors turned away and pronounced sentence of death upon His most pure blood, and martyred Him. In the early years not a single soul attained. They did what all the peoples of the world had done. Glory be to God! Hadi Dawlatabadi, despite his lack of knowledge about the essence of the Cause, hath striven and continueth to strive to lead the people astray. Say: Perdition betide thee, O heedless one! This year he turned in the name of the House of God toward the dawning-place of vain imaginings, and failed to attain unto that place which, like unto the sun, hath been brilliant and radiant from the beginning of the Cause until now.

<p>In His Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! O Muhammad-Rida, upon thee be the Glory of God. The Supreme Pen hath made mention of thee before and after. Remember when thou wert in the presence of the Throne and didst hear the Voice of the Wronged One. Blessed is the soul that hath today attained unto the divine Will and hath held fast unto the Purpose of all the worlds. The entire world, both its divines and others, was created specifically for this wondrous Day. Yet when the Morn of Revelation dawned and the world was illumined by the lights of His countenance, all turned away save whom God willed. The cause of veils and the source of barriers have been and continue to be the ignorant divines. They are the ones who changed God’s bounty into denial and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition. God willing, mayest thou ever be the recipient of the favors of God, exalted be His glory, and celebrate His praise. Convey on behalf of the True One My greetings to the loved ones in that land, that perchance a new spirit may be manifested in those temples. Say: Be not grieved by the deeds of the heedless and the veiled. All who dwell on earth are seen as children playing with clay, and they understand not. They worship idols and perceive not. What idol could be greater than he who was known as truthful but proved false? He was the greatest idol that was cast down by the hand of power, and likewise another idol. Soon thou shalt see the third in the flames. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Faithful. Say: O friends! Fix your gaze upon God and adorn yourselves with spiritual qualities. Whatever befalleth you, refer it to God. By God’s life! He will seize the wrongdoers with manifest might. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones in that place and upon those who have attained unto My mighty Tablet.</p>

<p>O Mirza Asadu’llah, surnamed Mubayyin! The Supreme Pen speaks in the name of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise: Mankind has been created to know God, and today the Manifestation of Power, the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Dayspring of Inspiration, and the Source of Command is speaking openly and clearly among the people of the world. He it is Who speaks “I was a Hidden Treasure,” and through the wonders of His grace He has revealed Himself to all things through all His beauteous names. In this Revelation, He Who spoke the blessed words “Thou shalt not see Me” now speaks “Look and thou shalt see Me.” Exalted, exalted be His grace that has encompassed all created things! Exalted, exalted be His mercy that has preceded all contingent beings! Blessed is the soul that has attained to this supreme grace and has taken the most pure wine from the hand of the mighty Giver, drinking it in complete detachment from all else. This Day has no equal or likeness, nor will it have any peer or opposite. Strive that thou mayest be illumined by the lights of His countenance and be nourished by the fruits of the divine and heavenly Lote-Tree. Long has thy acceptance endured, and when thou didst turn, thou didst attain unto this Book that nothing can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou must occupy thyself with the remembrance of God and guide people to the Law of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before the Wronged One, Who has sent down for thee this Most Impregnable, Most Holy, Most Wondrous and Luminous Tablet. Convey Our greetings to thy mother and thy wife. We testify that they have turned to the Supreme Horizon and believed in God, the Creator of the heavens. Verily We hear their cry and behold them in their love for God, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Upon them be the glory of God, now and in the future and in the past.</p>

<p>The Most Great Book declares: The world hath been and continues to be darkened by the breaths of the oppressors. The promised Truth is manifest and uttereth the most exalted call, yet all remain veiled and heedless save those souls whom the veils of idle fancies have not prevented from the dawnings of the lights of certitude. The source and origin of tyranny have been the divines. Through the sentences pronounced by these haughty and wayward souls the rulers of the earth have wrought that which ye have heard. The Jewish divines pronounced sentence for the crucifixion of the Spirit (Christ), and the divines of the idolaters, the Torah and the Gospel for the murder of the Lord of all beings in the land of Sad. Consider how through the verdict of certain divines there befell the Twin Luminous Lights that which caused the Apostle to lament and the Chaste One to cry out. The reins of the heedless masses have been and are in the hands of the exponents of idle fancies and vain imaginings. These decree what they please. God, verily, is clear of them, and We, too, are clear of them, as are such as have testified unto that which the Pen of the Most High hath spoken in this glorious Station. Today steadfastness is accounted among the most meritorious of deeds. Hold ye fast unto it, O people of Baha, and be not of the heedless ones. Convey to the friends in that land the greetings of the Wronged One, and gladden them all with His remembrance, that haply they may attain unto and hold fast unto that which is everlasting and enduring. Say: Verily He heareth what your tongues utter and seeth what ye do. The glory from Us be upon the friends of God and His loved ones who have cast the world behind their backs and held fast unto the Most Great Name, which proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Uttering, the All-Knowing.”</p>

Thou art remembered before the Wronged One, and this most wondrous and most holy Tablet hath been revealed in thy name. Blessed art thou, for thou hast inhaled the fragrances of revelation and perceived the sweet-scented perfume of the verses of God, and hast attained unto this greatest bounty, in comparison with which the oceans of the world appear as but a drop. Beseech thou God–exalted be His glory–to aid thee to teach His Cause and to remain steadfast therein. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Desire, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy Cause and guided me unto Thy straight path.

O Buzurg! Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We have heard what was therein and have answered thee through this Tablet, from whose horizon hath shone the light of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all men. Beware lest the doubts of those who have turned away and denied God, the Revealer of verses, prevent thee. Say: “My God, my God! I wish to hear Thy remembrance and praise from every vein of my veins, and from my hairs Thy description and the description of Thy loved ones. My God, my God! I testify that this Day is Thy Day, wherein naught should be seen save the signs of Thy power and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee to inscribe me, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, among those who have acknowledged Divine Unity and detached themselves from idle fancies and from that which befitteth not Thy days. O Lord! Honor me with Thy presence, or through Thy bounty and favor ordain its reward for me. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being and Master of the hereafter and the former times, by Thy Most Great Name, the Most Glorious, and by that which lay hidden in Thy knowledge and treasured within the repositories of Thine infallibility, to make me one of the servants of Thy Cause, that I may glory therein amidst Thy servants and Thy creation. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer.” Convey My greetings to My loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy and grace.

Hear once again the Call from the Lote Tree beyond which there is no passing, raised up upon the white earth: “Verily there is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.” O thou who gazest toward the horizon! Look, then hear what the people of the Bayan have uttered, who turned away from the All-Merciful by following the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Say: By the life of God! The Point of the Bayan appeared for My Cause, My remembrance and My praise, and gave the glad-tidings to all of this Manifestation, which was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of existence. Say: Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great Ocean. Cast aside vain imaginings and take what hath been sent down unto you from God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Say: Will what ye possess profit you? Nay, by the Lord of the Throne and earth! And will what the people have avail you? Nay, by My Self that ruleth over all that was and shall be! Say: O people of the Bayan! Beware lest ye reject the truth with your mouths.

Thus hath the Tablet manifested its lights, and the Pen its traces, and the sea its waves, and the sun its radiance and its light and its effulgence.

I swear by the Most Great Name that if the loved ones of God had moved according to God’s will, thou wouldst now witness most of mankind turning toward God.

<p>O Mirza Hassan! He is the Mighty, the Beautiful!</p>
<p>Much time has passed and covenants have been fulfilled, yet no bird has taken flight from that direction nor brought any news to the friends. Perhaps the islands of the pen have reverted to nothingness and the sea of ink has run dry, for the pen has not joined with any inscription nor has any tablet been adorned with writing. If spiritual friends have gathered in the divine tree, why do they not cry out from their souls? And if true lovers are drawn to their original homeland, why do they not send their spirits to the city of the Beloved? The eye of love remained expectant and the ear of seeking was deprived. These days mark the end of union and the beginning of separation. The holy peacock’s song comes to an end and it resolves to return to the divine Lote-Tree. Many are the enraptured lovers who remain separated from the Beloved and sacrifice their lives in the deserts of separation and deprivation. The wine of union is not always flowing, nor is the nightingale of beauty always singing. A time comes when the nightingale of faithfulness falls silent and flies to the furthermost Tree, there to whisper wordlessly with the Friend. Therefore, O my dear one, take a step and pass beyond place, for until you drink from the fountain of “returning,” you will not stand upon the throne of “we belong to God.” The sea of love is surging and this servant has now drunk the wine of eternity, and the pen has taken from his hand the reins of pause - whatever it wishes, it pours forth upon the page. But the wine of contingent existence is not worthy of this intoxication, and the realm of placelessness cannot contain this being. Therefore you must choose solitude and occupy yourself with silence.</p>

Hearken unto the call of the Divine Lote-Tree which hath been raised in the prison-land by the command of the Lord of Names, and act according to that which proceedeth from the Dayspring of the Cause. Today thou must purify thy heart with the Kawthar of detachment from all else save God and consume all the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings through the effulgences of the Sun of certitude, that thou mayest gaze upon the horizon of Revelation with pure vision, sanctified heart and illumined breast. He verily ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He desireth. He is, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. All that hath appeared and shall appear on earth hath been recorded and inscribed in the divine Books. The Tablet of Ra’is was revealed at the time of departure from the Land of Mystery - read it that thou mayest become aware of divine knowledge. Likewise the Surih of Heykal and others like it, that thou mayest know of a certainty that not a leaf stirreth except that God knoweth its movement, its stability and its conditions. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. To this all things bear witness, did ye but know. That which hath been made manifest in this preeminent, this most exalted Revelation stands unparalleled in the annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its like. It hath never been permissible for anyone to test God, nor is it now. He verily testeth whom He willeth. He is, in truth, the Ruler over what He willeth. God willing, mayest thou be successful through His grace, abide beneath the shade of His mercy, and act in accordance with that which He loveth and is pleased with. The glory be upon thee and upon him who was named Sadiq from the presence of a Generous Giver.</p>

<p>We beseech God to raise up one of His men, and to detach him from all creation, and to adorn his heart with the vesture of might and confidence, that he may help his Lord amidst the concourse of the universe, and, when he becometh aware of what hath been revealed for His Majesty the Shah, he may arise and take the Tablet, by the permission of his Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, and hasten to the residence of His Majesty. And when he shall arrive at the place of his throne, let him alight in the caravanserai, and let him hold converse with none till he goeth forth one day and standeth where he shall pass by. And when the royal harbingers shall appear, let him raise up the Tablet with the utmost humility and courtesy, and say, “It hath been sent on the part of the Prisoner”. And it is incumbent upon him to be in such a mood that, should the king decree his death, he shall not be troubled within himself, and shall hasten to the place of sacrifice saying, “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, that Thou hast made me a helper of Thy Cause, and hast decreed unto me martyrdom in Thy path! By Thy Glory, I would not exchange this cup for all the cups in the worlds, for Thou hast not ordained any equivalent to this, neither do Kawthar and Salsabil rival it!” But if he letteth him go, and interfereth not with him, let him say, “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all the worlds! Verily, I am content with Thy good pleasure and what Thou hast predestined unto me in Thy path, even though I did desire that the earth might be dyed with my blood for Thy love. But what Thou willest is best for me: verily, Thou knowest what is in myself, while I know not what is in Thy Self; and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>

<p>O Haji Muhammad-Baqir, who hath attained! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a mention from Us unto him who hath cast away what he possessed and taken what was sent down from God, the Lord of all worlds. When he drank the wine of recognition, he turned toward the Dawning-Place of his Lord’s Command, the All-Merciful, and traversed land and sea until he entered the abode of the Wronged One, Who was imprisoned through what the hands of the heedless had wrought. Blessed art thou for having turned and attained the lights of the Countenance and been among those who have attained. By the life of God! My mention of thee cannot be equaled by whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven. The Tongue of Grandeur in the most exalted station beareth witness to this. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Helper and my Strengthener! I beseech Thee by those who were martyred in Thy path and gave up their spirits in Thy good-pleasure, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy service. O Lord! I have turned to Thee, acknowledging my weakness, my powerlessness and my evanescence. I beseech Thee to assist me in all conditions and to send down upon me a blessing from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. All atoms testify to Thy sovereignty and all created things to Thy power. There is no God but Thee, the Helper, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Thus doth the Wronged One guide thee and strengthen thee to turn unto Him and teach thee that whereby thou mayest remember God, thy Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Give thanks and be of the grateful. Grieve not over anything. Trust in the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. He is with those who have turned to Him. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing. The glory rest upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this Mention whereby the faces of those near unto God were illumined. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Patient, the All-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Generous! This is an epistle from Baha to one of His handmaidens who was saddened by the calamities that befell her in this world, that joy might possess her after sorrow. O My handmaiden! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison, and know that the tribulations were all created for My Self. Thus was it ordained in the heaven of My decree and the kingdom of My determination. Thy Lord is, verily, powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Were I to recount unto thee that which hath befallen Me in the path of God, the Lord of all names, thou wouldst lament throughout thy days and weep for the Wronged One at eventide and at dawn. We were created for the Cause of God and His service. He hath ordained for Us naught save that which is better than whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven. Verily, he who hath ascended is in the Most Exalted Horizon, thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, doth testify to this. He is the Helper of him who hath no helper, and the Companion of him who hath no companion. He is, verily, the Lord of all mankind. If thou seekest a helper, here am I, thy helper, and if thou desirest a companion, here am I, thy companion. Rejoice thou in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone forth the sun of favors. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when most men have turned away therefrom. Grieve thou not save in My grief, and rejoice not save in My joy. This is better for thee than all the treasures of creation. Trust thou in God under all conditions. He is, verily, with thee at all times. By My life! Thy Lord sufficeth thee, and he who hath ascended is in joy and fragrance. Verily, he who hath quaffed the choice wine of his Lord’s love, death shall not overtake him. Blessed are they who are endued with insight. Thus have We sent down from the heaven of bounty that which shall gladden thy heart. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Magnify thou My Name amongst those who are round about thee, from the Revealer of verses.</p>

<p>This is a Book We have made as Our presence for those who have turned to God in these days wherein the lands were transformed. Whoso visiteth what hath been sent down from the direction of the Throne in this Tablet and findeth himself in doubt concerning the meeting with his Lord - he is of them that have turned away from God, the Cleaver of the dawn. O Birds of Paradise! Hearken unto the call of the Beloved in these days wherein feet have slipped. Through your drawing nigh, the Concourse on High rejoiced, and through your withdrawal from the Meeting, and your thirst near the ocean, lamentation was raised by the dwellers of the cities of eternity. How wonderful this joy and grief, as though they embraced each other on this Day of God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Choosing. The hearts of the idolaters were consumed by what We sent before; therefore do they plot against My Self morning and evening. Blessed are ye for having entered the City and attained unto what your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, desired. It behooveth you to manifest from your faces gladness and joy that every soul may find in you submission and contentment. Thus hath it been decreed from the Pen of Glory. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Knower of what is secret and manifest. Ye are beneath the shadow of My loving-kindness and within the tabernacles of My mercy. The eye of God is therefore fixed upon you, O ye who are endued with insight! Blessed are ye, and blessed is he who loveth you, and he who turneth unto you, purely for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Compelling. God beareth witness, and they who circle round the Throne, that ye have attained unto His presence and circumambulated the Kaaba of His Cause and appeared before His countenance. He, verily, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. By My life! We have accepted what ye desired and We shall be with you at all times. And glory be upon you from the presence of a mighty Helper.</p>

Grieve not, for thy son hath attained unto that which none else hath attained, and God hath ordained for thee the reward of those who have attained unto His presence, and hath assigned thee a portion.

Blessed art thou inasmuch as the Pen of God hath moved to make mention of thee while confined in the prison with a number of souls. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having adorned my head with the crown of Thy favor amidst the people of Thy Kingdom, and for having made my son a servant of Thine in Thy prison. I beseech Thee, O Lord, by Thy power that hath encompassed all things, to enable him under all conditions to serve Thee, O Lord of all names. Then cause him to be so immersed in the ocean of Thy love that he may desire naught but what Thou hast desired, and may gaze toward the horizon of Thy good-pleasure in such wise that nothing that hath been created in the world may hinder him from remembering Thee, O Fashioner of earth and heaven. And strip not from his temple the robe of special favor throughout the everlasting dominion of Thy Kingdom, O Lord of mankind. Blind is the eye that hath not beheld Thy power and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, and dumb is the tongue that hath not acknowledged Thy oneness and confessed Thy singleness, and hath not believed in Thy dominion and the potency of Thy command in the kingdom of Thy creation. There is no God but Thee, the Most Wise of judges and the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who was before contingent things! This is an epistle from Us to him who hath believed in God on a day wherein the Herald hath called out from the precincts of the Kingdom: “Behold Me, O ye who are endued with insight! The lights of the Countenance have shone forth from the horizon of the Command and have illumined all regions. Every atom proclaimeth: ‘The Self-Subsisting is come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, the All-Choosing.’ The Kingdom hath been adorned with My Name, and the Realm of Might with My remembrance. Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the veils. Rend ye asunder the veils of idle fancies with the fingers of certitude, then shatter the idols of vain imaginings through the power of My Name, the All-Compelling over all creation. This is a Day wherein the heaven hath been rolled up and the mountains have been scattered. Blessed is the soul that hath attained, and the heart that hath turned unto the Qiblih of all horizons. O thou who hast turned! Hearken unto the call from the Divine Lote-Tree: ‘Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Compelling.’ Be thou steadfast in the Cause, then make mention of thy Lord amongst the servants. Say: Vain imaginings have been effaced and the light of certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will with sovereignty and power. Blessed is the thirsty one who hath turned unto the Most Great Ocean, and the seeker who hath set his face toward the Salsabil of divine knowledge. Beware lest the world prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. Draw nigh unto God through the power of remembrance, for this is My remembrance - thus hath the matter been ordained in the Scriptures and Tablets. Those who have turned away, these wander in the wilderness of vain hopes. Can one who is laden with hopes ever attain unto God, the Lord of the end? Nay, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most Exalted! Say: O my Lord! I have cast away what was with me, seeking Thy countenance. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance in all conditions. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the All-Bountiful. And praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the Kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>

This is a Book from Us to him who hath attained unto the lights of the All-Merciful after he was denied by every heedless doubter. Thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee that which causeth minds and spirits to take flight. Verily, He remembereth in the prison him who hath turned unto Him. His grace hath encompassed all regions. How many a wise one hath failed to attain the presence of his Lord, and how many a youth, upon hearing the call, hath exclaimed: “Here am I, O Lord of Lords!” Blessed is the face that hath turned unto the Countenance, and the heart that hath been illumined from the Dayspring of inspiration. They who have taken as friends others besides God - these have been prevented by following vain imaginings. They worship idols while supposing themselves to be among the choicest of creation in the sight of the sublime Truth. Say: God knoweth what is hidden in the breasts. With Him is the knowledge of all things in the Book. Give thanks unto God for having attained unto this Choice Wine, whose seal We have loosened with the finger of power and might, and for having been honored in His days, and for having had the Pen of Revelation from the Lord of all mankind move upon thy mention. Say: O my God! Aid me in that which Thou lovest, then ordain for me that which shall make me ever-gazing toward Thee, speaking Thy Name, and proclaiming Thy Cause amidst all creation. I am he who hath turned unto Thee and placed his trust in Thee. Make me, then, to be of those who have entered the pavilion of Thy glory, who are steadfast in Thy Cause, and who stand firm in that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Tablets. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. The Glory be upon thee, and upon thy father and mother, and upon all who are with you, whether male or female. And praise be to God, the Lord of all beings.</p>

Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My throne, that it may draw thee to the heaven of My grace and the court of My mercy. By God!

Wilt thou remain still in thy place after all those around thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise, have been stirred into motion? Detach thyself from all else but God and remind the people with wisdom and utterance. Thus have We commanded thee in the Tablet from the presence of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

Beware lest ye follow those who have denied God and have united with the wrongdoers in harming Him. Know thou that We have stirred the barren earth by Our power. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. We have raised up one with the power of might and strength and sent him to the object of worship of the polytheists, that he might perchance remember within himself and turn to the Beloved of the worlds. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth that thou mayest be informed and be of them that attain. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>

Can anyone prevent the Pen of Command from that which it hath been bidden? Nay, by Him Who hath caused the rivers to flow! Can tribulations prevent Me from the remembrance of the Lord of Names? Nay, by Him Who hath made the night and day to succeed each other! I remember My Lord, the All-Merciful, at all times, and the hosts of the wicked do not frighten Me. Were it not for His remembrance, My tongue would profit Me not, and were it not for His command, I would not love My life. He knoweth the secrets that lie within hearts.

Follow thy Lord and grieve not over what transpireth in the world. Soon shall perish all of impotence and power that are therein, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the One, the All-Compelling. Hearken unto My words, find solace in the remembrance of thy Lord in private and in public. That which hath been ordained for you hath not been ordained for any others. Blessed are ye, then, and blessed is he who loveth you purely for the sake of your Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Praise be to God, the King, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, such that the veils of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of the Invisible and the Visible shall not keep thee back. The world hath been set ablaze by the fire of thy Lord’s Word, yet the people are heedless thereof, except they are a people confounded - save those whom God, thy Lord, hath willed. These are indeed the people of Baha, recorded in a preserved Tablet. Drink thou the Kawthar of life at all times, turning unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful. He, verily, ordaineth for whomsoever He pleaseth that which He desireth, but the people understand not. Give thanks unto God for having sent down unto thee that which causeth the sincere ones to soar. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me and revealed unto me that which cheereth the eyes. My soul be a sacrifice for Thy tribulations, O Lord of Names and O Thou Who art imprisoned and estranged! The very essence of patience lamenteth at what hath befallen Thee, and its eyes weep for Thee, O Beloved! I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Manifestation of Thyself and the Dayspring of Thy signs, to record me among those who have attained unto Thy days and answered Thy call. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>

<p>This is a Tablet from Baha to him who hath believed in God, Creator of all things, that he may be mindful of that which hath been sent down from the Most Exalted Pen after the imprisonment of the Ancient Beauty in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the aggressors have wrought. Verily, in the departure of the Luminary of the horizons from the region of Iraq, and His embarkation upon the ship after passing through the realm, and the establishment of the Chosen One’s throne in the Land of Mystery, and His departure therefrom through tyranny, are signs for those who perceive and evidences for those who discern. He it is Who hath caused the clouds to be subdued and the rain to pour forth from the heavens, and Who hath split asunder the tongue of dawn through His firm and mighty command. Say: Verily He is the One Who calleth unto Himself between the heavens and the earth, and neither the harm of those who have disbelieved nor the might of the polytheists hath deterred Him. Say: If ye desire the supreme bounty, by God, it hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the Most Glorious. Seize it with the hand of certitude and cast away what ye possess of the intimations of the wayward ones. We have ordained for thee a reward in the Kingdom of recompense. Beware lest the utterances of the heedless sadden thee. Soon shalt thou behold that which thou wert promised by the True One shining forth from the horizon of faithfulness. Verily thy Lord is possessed of great bounty. Those who have cast behind them the Book of God and followed those who have turned away from the Countenance - these are among the bewildered ones in the valley of heedlessness. Beware lest ye differ in the Cause - gather ye on the shore of this Most Great Sea. By My life! Through your unity the pillars of the deniers shall be demolished. Be ye people of this City - whoso entereth therein must needs be adorned with the attributes of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Wise. And mercy and glory be upon thee and upon him who hath restrained himself from all else save Me and hath found solace in My wondrous remembrance.</p>

<p>O Mirza Hasan! He is the Most Great, the All-Glorious! This is a wondrous day. We behold the people struck down and trees uprooted from their foundations. All have been seized by their forelocks through fear of thy Lord, the One, the All-Compelling. This is the day We mentioned in the Qur’an and then in the Bayan - take heed, O people of insight! The idolaters rush headlong toward the Evil One. Say: He dwelleth in the lowest depths of the fire. We have shown them who led them astray from the straight path that they might recognize him and seek for themselves a way of escape unto God. They have taken him as their lord - the word of chastisement hath been fulfilled against them. Say: This is the path of God for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and the Cause is in the grasp of power. Say: To whom will ye flee? No protector have ye this day. The Almighty hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Choosing. Look not upon what hath befallen Us of tribulations. We foretold what hath appeared in the Scriptures and Tablets, and from the horizon of tribulation do We summon the servants unto the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Through tribulation have We nurtured the Cause in bygone ages. Soon wilt thou find the Cause shining forth from the horizon of glory with power and dominion. Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord and remind the people in this Day wherein intoxication hath seized those in all regions. Say: To whom will ye flee? No defender have ye this day from God. Turn ye unto Him and make not yourselves deserving of chastisement. Say: Are ye content with an hour of this world while depriving yourselves of what hath been ordained for you throughout the duration of God’s kingdom? This is naught but error. Fear ye God, then hasten unto Him - with Him is excellent reward. Glorify thy Lord before those around thee, then remind them with the remembrances of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficing, the Most High.</p>

Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained unto the mysteries of God in this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. O peoples of the earth! Fear ye God, and follow not every remote clamourer who hath cast away righteousness and taken up passion in following the imaginings of the heedless. This is the Day wherein the gate of utterance hath been opened before the faces of all religions, and wherein the ocean of knowledge hath surged and the fragrance of God, the Lord of this mighty station, hath been wafted. Say: O people of the Furqan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and be not of the wrongdoers. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken, and the Dove of Utterance warbled upon the branch of knowledge that there is none other God but Him, the One Who, through His word, hath power over all things, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Blessed is he who hath cast away passion and taken up guidance, and hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. O people! This is the Day of God - recognize ye its station and be not of the ignorant. This is the Day wherein the lips of existence have smiled at the surging of the ocean of bounty by the command of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

This is a Day wherein the Herald has proclaimed before the faces of all people: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Lord of all worlds!” The Most Great Ocean has appeared and We have brought forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance that were hidden and treasured within its shells, through a command from God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The Promise has come and the Promised One has appeared before the faces of princes and divines, speaking that which God, the Powerful, the Almighty, has commanded Him - such that neither the might of the world weakened Him nor the power of kings and rulers prevented Him. We have sent down the verses and manifested clear proofs for the guidance of humanity, as attested by the Clear Book in His possession. While walking in the prison and swimming in the ocean of utterance, We have turned toward you and remembered you with that which shall never perish, through the everlasting dominion of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. When you attain unto My Tablet and find the fragrance of your Lord’s verses, say: “My God, my God! My outer and inner tongue, my limbs and members, my veins and the very hairs of my body bear witness to Your unity and oneness, and that You are the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. O my Lord! I beseech You by the fragrances of Your revelation to ordain for me that which will cause me to turn toward the lights of Your countenance, to speak in praise of Your Self, to hearken unto the traces of Your Most Exalted Pen and Your sweetest call, and to arise to serve Your Cause, O Lord of all humanity. O my Lord! You see the weak one clinging to the cord of Your strength, and the poor one seeking the door of Your riches. I beseech You not to disappoint him in what he seeks from the ocean of Your bounty and the heaven of Your generosity. Verily You are the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is no God but You, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>

Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath guided thee to My path, caused thee to hear My call, and shown thee My signs. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee among My servants to take the cup of My loving-kindness from the hand of My grace and to drink therefrom once in My Name and again in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>

In the nights and days he speaketh in remembrance of the Lord of all mankind and holdeth fast to the promotion of His Cause. Blessed be his tongue, his hand, his heart, his hearing and his sight. He is among those who have entrusted their affairs unto their Lord and have placed their reliance in Him under all conditions, who have caused their will to be extinguished in His will and have chosen for themselves what God hath chosen for them.

Give thanks unto thy Lord and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having made me to speak of Thy remembrance, to soar in the atmosphere of Thy love, and to gaze toward the horizon of Thy justice. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy sincere servants and Thy near ones.

I swear by the Lord of Power Who, from the Most Great Scene, summoneth mankind unto the Most Exalted Horizon - were men, now heedless, to become aware of even less than a needle’s eye of the truth, they would all offer themselves up as a sacrifice for but one of those who have turned towards God. Strange it is that even such souls remain unaware of their stations, for such is the bounty vouchsafed unto them that were but a glimmer thereof to become manifest, the earth would be transformed into another earth. Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and We have revealed for thee that whereby thy remembrance shall endure. Be thou grateful, therefore, and be of them that render thanks. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as would cause every agitated soul to become tranquil and every restless being to find repose. Say: O people of Baha! Let not the tyranny of rulers prevent you from drawing nigh unto the Lord of Names. By My life! The oppressor desired to extinguish the light, but God, in truth, caused it to burn brighter; he wished to quench it, but the hand of Power made it blaze more fiercely; he sought to destroy God’s Cause, but through his very acts did God’s Cause gain ascendancy. The oppressor dwelleth in delusion, while thy Lord standeth on manifest truth. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land. Soon shall the recompense of His chosen ones and His friends become manifest, and each shall behold his name inscribed in God’s Book. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful.

<p>O people of Baha and companions of the Crimson Ark! Hearken unto the call of God, the Lord of all beings, which hath been raised from this most exalted horizon. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great. This is the Day wherein that which was recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of this Great Announcement, hath been made manifest - the Announcement whereby the hearts of the idolaters were sorely troubled. We have observed thy turning and thy drawing nigh, and We have turned unto thee from this distant Shore and made mention of thee with that which gladdeneth the eye of true knowledge and attracteth the hearts of the sincere ones. Blessed is the stranger who hath sought the shelter of God, the Lord of all worlds, and blessed is the poor one who hath laid hold on the cord of wealth from the presence of One mighty and powerful. When thou hearest the scratching of My Pen and findest My remembrance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise and thanksgiving be unto Thee, and glory and splendor be upon Thee, for having sent down unto me from the heaven of Thy will that which hath raised me to the kingdom of Thy utterance and the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the Kawthar whereby Thou didst quicken Thy servants and creatures and didst manifest that which lay hidden within Thy knowledge, to make me one of them who have not been heedless of Thy remembrance and whom the hosts of vain imaginings have not kept back from turning unto Thee in Thy days. O Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have forsaken the religion of a people that believed not in Thee and Thy signs, and who have turned unto Thee with radiant faces in Thy days. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have drunk the wine of true knowledge from the cup of Thy bounty and the Kawthar of utterance from the ocean of Thy grace. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall make me rich through Thy riches and detached from all else besides Thee. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>O friends of God in Jasb! He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious! O loved ones of God in Jasb! There hath befallen Us in the path of God that which befell certain of My loved ones in that place. He, in Whose possession is the Mother Book, beareth witness to this. The dwellers of Paradise have lamented at what hath befallen you at the hands of those who have changed God’s blessing into ingratitude and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition. Say: Beware lest the oppression of the enemies or the might of the divines prevent you. Behold, then remember what befell the friends of God aforetime who arose to serve the Cause throughout ages and centuries. The heedless have imprisoned My Name in the land of Ta, and My chosen ones elsewhere. Nay, they are in doubt and schism. By God’s life! The fire of hatred hath been kindled in the breasts of the divines - they are the repositories of tyranny and the daysprings of iniquity. Through them have the eyes of the Concourse on High shed tears, and the Eye of Grandeur in the most exalted station. O Ghulam-Rida! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious. He maketh mention of thee and lamenteth for what hath befallen thee from the manifestations of Satan. Thou wert beneath the glance of thy Lord in days wherein the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of creation. We make mention of thy brother and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance and My favor which have preceded the righteous. And We remember My loved ones there who have not been deterred by the censure of the censurers nor the clamor of the heedless from God, the Lord of lords. Say: Fear ye God, and reject not Him Who hath come to you with the proofs of the Prophets and with that whereof the eye of creation hath seen no likeness. Thus hath warbled the Dove of the Cause upon the branch of eternity. Blessed is he who hath heard and responded to the Light that hath shone forth from the luminous Hand. Upon thee, and upon him, and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God, the Lord of all names.</p>

Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My grandeur and power, which hath been raised from the Divine Lote-Tree upon the spot of My utterance: Verily, there is no God but I, the Imprisoned, the Stranger, the Unique One. Let not separation and remoteness grieve thee. Thou hast indeed fulfilled the Covenant, and We have recorded thee among the faithful ones. Blessed is this remoteness, to which We have testified nearness. Thy Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. All things depend upon God’s testimony. We have testified for thee on this day that thou mayest be of them that rejoice. Shouldst thou taste the sweetness of thy Lord’s utterance, thou wouldst abandon creation behind thee and say: “O my God, the Most High! Praise be unto Thee in all conditions. Thou art, verily, praised in what Thou doest and obeyed in what Thou willest.” I beseech Thee, O King of eternity and Lord of all nations, to ordain for me that which is best for me in this world and the next. Then make me content with Thy good-pleasure, effaced in Thy will, steadfast in Thy love, holding fast to the cord of Thy favors and clinging to the hem of Thy bounties. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise. We have been with thee in thy joy and thy sorrow, and are aware of what hath befallen thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Soon will all that thou seest today perish, but that which hath been ordained for thee in a mighty Tablet shall endure. Blessed is he who hath migrated in the path of God, and woe unto him who hath prevented people from attaining the presence of the Face and hath become a hindering veil between them and their Ancient Lord. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me while I was in the hands of the oppressors.</p>

This is not the day to tarry when ye have heard the Call from the Supreme Horizon. Hasten, and be not of the patient ones. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.

Assuredly the tribulations inflicted by the wrongdoing polytheistic souls have intervened and prevented the servants and loved ones from remembrance and praise and nearness and attainment. Know with certain knowledge that soon God’s Cause will be exalted among the peoples of the world and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Quickener of nations, will be made manifest. Blessed is the soul that preserved its station and arose with perfect steadfastness to serve the Cause. Today the breezes of revelation have perfumed the world and the fragrances of utterance have encompassed creation, yet the servants are heedless and turned away, save whom God willeth, the Lord of this exalted station. Convey to the friends the greetings and salutations of the Wronged One, and gladden them with that which hath been revealed. Blessed is the soul from whom wafteth the fragrance of steadfastness and from whose brow shineth forth the light of utterance. He is indeed of the people of Baha in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds.

In these days both men and women of that land have attained unto the mention of God. We have heard your sighing and lamentation, and have witnessed what hath befallen you. Blessed are ye for having shown patience. How excellent is the reward of them that are patient, as recorded in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds! Cast behind you your sorrows, and take up the goblets of prosperity in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn and the Sender of the Winds. Then drink therefrom the Salsabil of patience in My Name, and the Kawthar of resignation in remembrance of Me, the Mighty, the Wondrous.

<p>O Ramadan! Upon thee be the Glory of the All-Merciful! In this blessed month the friends in this land have attained to the honor of true fasting, inasmuch as they have, for the sake of God, performed that which was enjoined upon them. They fast during the day and arise for prayer during the night. Blessed are they, for theirs is a goodly beginning and end. We counsel the people of God to perform such deeds as will cause the turning of the servants unto God and draw nigh those who dwell in all lands. This is the purpose of the wisdom that hath been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all beings in the Sacred Scriptures and Tablets. Most of the people of the earth are heedless. They imagine that this party hath turned away from God and His loved ones and hath clung to the dictates of self and passion. Glory be to God! The vain imaginings of men have debarred them and kept them back from the shore of the sea of oneness. This party is occupied day and night with the remembrance of God and is engaged in the reformation of the world. Blessed is the tongue that speaketh the truth, and the hand that hath taken hold of His Book, and the eye that hath beheld His signs, and the ear that hath heard His wondrous and new call.</p>

You had written: “Send down tribulation upon Your enemies and seize them with the fullness of Your might and Your power to chastise and punish.” These words were heard, but the tongue of the All-Merciful speaks thus: O friend! Give praise to the Beloved of the world Who has enabled you to recognize the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. If this bounty that was bestowed upon you had been bestowed upon all the peoples of the world, all would have turned to the Friend and gathered beneath the shade of the Tree. That which was not given to them was given to you, for their past deeds have deprived and excluded them from God’s infinite bounties. In the station of communion and supplication with the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, speak these words: “O my Beloved, my Purpose, and the Ultimate Goal of my desires! You behold this evanescent servant who has turned to You and sought from You the eternal water. Grant that which befits Your greatness and is worthy of Your days. I beseech You by Your Most Great Name to rend asunder the veils of the servants and to show and open unto them the gate of mercy. Awaken those who slumber with the hand of loving-kindness and tenderness, and make the heedless aware through the call of Your sweet banquet, that all may turn to You and advance towards You. O Lord! Deprive them not of the outpourings of the clouds of Your mercy and the breezes of the springtime of bounty in Your days.

<p>O Kazim! The entire world hath been brought into existence from nothingness for the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Yet in every age and century when the Sun of Truth hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of divine Will, all turned away save a few. Reflect upon the Messenger of God, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - after His appearance all turned away and the desire to shed His blood became manifest from the souls of the idolaters. Then the verse of emigration was revealed and He departed from Batha to Yathrib. And likewise reflect upon the Spirit (Christ) - the divines of idols and of the Torah rose up in such opposition that the hands of power bore Him to the fourth heaven, and this is a saying to which all the divines testify and proclaim. And similarly with the Prophets who came before - should one reflect, he would find himself bewildered at what befell those Dawning-places of divine revelation, such that the Most Exalted Pen lamenteth. The divines of the age have been and continue to be the cause of the prevention of the servants and the source of oppression. Through their opposition all turn away from the Truth. We beseech God to confirm thee in such wise that the veils of the world and the clouds of the peoples prevent thee not from the King of Eternity, and that in the days of His manifestation thou remain not deprived of the outpourings of the heaven of mercy of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Say: My God, my God! I have turned toward Thee, holding fast to the cord of Thy bounty and clinging to the hem of Thy generosity.

<p>O Kamal, upon whom be the Glory of God! In the name of the peerless Lord! O Kamal, thou hast been blessed with two great bounties: First, that in the year Nine thou wast vouchsafed the presence of God, concerning which the Primal Point gave all this glad-tiding in His words: “And in the year Nine ye shall be blessed with attaining the presence of God.” Likewise thou wert honored with the divine exposition regarding the blessed verse “all food,” and this is that which the Primal Point gave glad-tidings of: “And in the year Nine ye shall comprehend all good.” Thou shouldst at all times be thankful to the All-Merciful that He blessed thee with this most great bounty. Thou didst drink from the ocean of reunion and partake of the Kawthar of His presence. Thy petitions reached the Most Holy Court time and again. We heard thy call and perceived the fragrance of thy love from thy prayers and remembrances. All the souls thou didst mention in thy writings were remembered at the Most Holy Court and were adorned with the ornament of the favors of the Lord of all being. Blessed art thou and they! Give them My glad-tidings and proclaim unto their faces, as bidden by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We counsel all to steadfastness, for the clamorous ones have been and are lying in wait for the monotheists and the sincere ones. Say: Should anyone come to you with the book of the netherworld and its pages, cast them behind you, then know that he is the clamorous one promised in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Loving. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones and My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of existence. O Kamal! The Self-Sufficient, the Most High, counseleth thee to render thy humility and reverence wholly unto God alone. This is a word wherewith We counseled thee in Baghdad - keep it before thine eyes as a command from Me, and I am the True Counselor.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-Quli! Upon thee be the eternal glory of God. We have mentioned thee time and again and have given thee the glad tidings that thy deeds have attained the honor of acceptance. Give thanks to thy Lord for this manifest bounty. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and manifested in my deeds Thy good-pleasure, the mighty, the exalted. I beseech Thee by the treasuries of Thy knowledge and the repositories of Thy wisdom, and by Thy Most Great Command and Thy Most Ancient Name, to assist me in all conditions to serve Thee and to serve Thy loved ones, and to ordain for me that which befitteth Thy glory and Thy majesty, Thy Cause and Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Praise be to God, thy deed hath been accepted and it cannot be equaled by the deeds of nations who were heedless of the Cause and denied God, the Lord of the worlds. The Wronged One maketh mention of thee at a time when sorrows and grief have encompassed Him from all directions. Two heedless ones in the great city have arisen to bring about ruin, and with a few dirhams have led Akhtar astray to publish calumnies. But far, far be it! Soon shall they witness their own impotence and the recompense of their deeds from God, the Just, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Through these intrigues they have sought to become acceptable to the enemies and the wicked among creation. However, the Wronged One giveth thanks to God for what hath befallen Him and respondeth, saying: I do not complain of My distress and sorrow. I am content with His decree and His destiny, and I praise Him for what hath come upon Me in His path. To this testify the pebbles of the earth and their essence, and this truthful, trustworthy Tongue. The glory from Us be upon the people of Baha who have taken hold of the Book, detached from every remote oppressor and every doubting ignorant one.</p>

He bestowed favor and showed generosity by bringing you from the land of Ta to the Prison-land that you might hear what is recorded in the divine Books and witness what has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. The Wronged One testifies that you have turned from your homeland to God, the Lord of the worlds, and attained the blessing of visiting His house and acted according to what was commanded in a clear Tablet. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid you in remembrance and praise, for He is the Protector of those who remember Him. Convey greetings to the loved ones of God wherever you find them, and give them the glad tidings of the splendors of the Sun of Providence. All are mentioned in His presence and are sustained by the Kawthar of His grace. Ask God to assist them to preserve what He has bestowed. Verily He has power over all things. O Muhammad! Place your trust in God in all matters. Verily He is with you in all conditions. He is verily with His trusting servants. You should proceed to different lands with the utmost joy and fragrance, like the breezes of the divine springtime of mercy, that perchance souls may be revived and arise to mention and praise God. Say: O people of God! The world is passing away and its evanescence is fully apparent. Deprive not yourselves of the immortal Kingdom through attachment to that which is transient. The atheists and hypocrites lie in wait - protect yourselves through God’s name and occupy yourselves with the Peerless Friend.

Blessed is thy father who migrated from his home in his longing to attain the presence of God and appeared before the Throne when the Cause was veiled in manifest obscurity. He drank from the Kawthar of reunion before its manifestation and attained to the Hidden Mystery before its revelation. To this testifieth He with Whom is a mighty Book. He was with Me for numbered days in the prison of Mim. Thus doth his Ancient Lord make mention of him - He Who proclaimeth from the heart of the world: “There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Informed.” He is among those who were martyred in the path of God and who drank the cup of nearness and good-pleasure from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Generous. Blessed is he, again blessed is he, and blessed are they who visit him, even as the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in His mighty prison. The glory shining forth from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon the Sacrifice who ascended unto God, the Lord of all worlds. We have remembered him with that which surpasseth all that the people possess, and We remember him as a token of Our grace, for verily I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Mehdi! We have heard thy call and have answered thee with this Tablet that thou mayest rejoice and be of the thankful. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having remembered me while I was among the heedless. I beseech Thee to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise and in that which Thou hast revealed in Thy perspicuous Book. And I beseech Thee to forgive me and my father and my uncle, and to remit our sins through Thy grace and generosity, O Thou through Whose Name the ocean of forgiveness surgeth in all creation, and the fragrance of generosity wafteth among the worlds, and the sweet savors of bounty are diffused throughout existence.

<p>O Ni’mat! Reflect upon the divine bounties, and likewise upon His gifts and favors. Upon an animal so tiny and small as to be invisible to the eye, He has bestowed hearing, intelligence, sight, perception and knowledge - truly a clear book to those possessed of insight. Read what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur’an: “We have recorded everything in a Book.” Ask of God that He may illumine hearts and minds with the light of recognition, so that, being purified from the tales of the past and the gulf of names, they may set forth toward the ocean of inner meanings. The names prevented the previous community from the lights of justice and fairness - some through the word “successor”, others through mention of “guardian”, and some parties through the terms “deputy” and “noble one” and “fourth pillar” and “mirror” remained deprived of the revealer of verses and possessor of names and attributes, and were forbidden the sealed wine. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having aided me to rend asunder the veils and guided me to the Mother Book. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love, such that the oppression of the oppressor may not frighten me, nor the might of the heedless, nor the croaking of the croaker, nor the doubts of the learned. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. O my Lord! Ordain for me that which shall profit me in Thy lands amongst Thy servants. Thou knowest better than I what is good for me. I testify that Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

At all times thou must, with the utmost wisdom and in a spirit of delight, offer unto them that are ready the most pure wine that floweth from the direction of the Most Great Scene. Regarding the stations of teaching and exposition, a Tablet was sent in the name of ’Allah-u-Mahdi’ and We commanded that it be conveyed to all. God willing, you will attain unto it and inform the people of its contents. The letter thou didst send to the servant who is present before the Throne was presented before the Countenance and We heard that which thou didst commune with God. We beseech Him to assist thee in His service and to grant thee that which is ordained in the kingdom of His grace. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee. We have remembered thee time and again and given thee to drink from cups through which whoso attaineth, attaineth unto that which is ordained by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. We shall hereafter make mention of a command from Our presence. Thy Lord is indeed the Manifest, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. The glory be upon thee and upon them that are with thee among those who have believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who is the Goal of all worlds!</p>
<p>Today the Mother Book cries out and the Qur’an makes mention, for the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Source of Divine Inspiration, and the Fountainhead of all Books hath appeared, manifest and evident, without veil or concealment, calling before the faces of all the world and summoning unto the most exalted horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath hearkened and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of certitude. Say: O friends, until ye pass beyond the rivers of names ye shall not attain to the ocean of meanings. Strive that words may not become a barrier and that deeds and utterances may not turn into veils. Today the Spirit circleth round and the souls of the near ones and the Messengers bow down in humility and submission. Blessed are they who have attained the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful and who have arisen to serve the Cause with manifest certitude. These are they who are the companions of the Crimson Ark, as recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Goal of the world that thou hast attained unto the Word of God and this Tablet hath been revealed in thy name. All the treasures of the world and whatsoever is possessed by the nations cannot be compared with His Word, as doth testify the Tongue of Grandeur in this exalted station. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wondrous!</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the kindred and give them the glad-tidings of God’s favors, exalted be His glory. Likewise to the friends in that land who have quaffed the choice wine that was sealed through the name of the Self-Subsisting and who gaze toward the most exalted horizon. We counsel all to steadfastness, for the irreligious and the transgressors lie in wait. His is the Command. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. And He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Today the Sun of grace is manifest and the ocean of loving-kindness is surging, and whatsoever God’s consummate wisdom requireth will assuredly appear from the heaven of His Will. And if the fulfillment of certain wishes of the friends be delayed, they should not become sorrowful. Fix thy gaze upon this blessed word which, like unto the sun, hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine Tablet and was sent to one of the servants: The pulse of the world is in the hand of the skilled Physician. He perceiveth the disease and in His wisdom prescribeth the remedy. God willing, drink ye in all conditions from the ocean of contentment. The loving-kindness of God hath ever been and shall ever be with the steadfast ones who have turned unto Him. Verily, all affairs are in His hands. He seeth and speaketh, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The fragrance of the love of the All-Merciful was wafted from thy letter. We found it through Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. He hath desired to make mention of Himself through thy turning unto Him. This is naught but a supreme bounty. O God of the worlds and Sovereign of the nations! I beseech Thee by the rustling of the Tree of Thy loving-kindness and by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, that Thou mayest ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will profit me in all Thy worlds. O God of Names and Creator of heaven! O Lord! Thou seest me clinging unto Thee and turning unto Thee, acknowledging that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath acknowledged before the creation of Thy earth and heaven. I beseech Thee to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and to withhold from me that which is unworthy of Thee, O Lord of all men and Master of the hereafter and the former times! Glory be upon Thee and upon Thy handmaiden who hath turned unto God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In His Name Who dawns forth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance! Today two calls are raised: the first is the call of the All-Merciful, and the second is the call of Satan. Those souls who, upon hearing the second call, utter the word “yea” - such souls are deprived of the Kingdom of utterance and the heaven of bounty. They are the manifestations of tyranny and lewdness, and the dawning-places of infidelity and transgression. Blessed are those souls who have attained to the hearing of the first call and have responded with “Here am I, O my God, here am I!” Upon them be the glory of God, His bounty, His light and His splendor.</p>
<p>O people of God! Hold fast unto the reformation of the world and its peoples, and be detached from corruption. This is the divine counsel which hath streamed forth and been sent down from the Eternal Pen. Man tasteth the cup of death but once; now if this should come to pass for the sake of God, its fragrance would perfume the world of existence.</p>
<p>The Wronged One speaketh through thy tongue: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known unto me Thy path, sent down unto me Thy verses, shown forth unto me Thy proofs, given me to drink from the cup of Thy knowledge, guided me to Thy announcement and caused me to speak forth Thy praise. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy knowledge which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy bounty, and by the fire whereby the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creatures have been set ablaze, to make me assured through Thy grace, steadfast in Thy Cause, and thoughtful of the manifestations of Thy power. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou seest the hands of my hope upraised toward the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me nor to withhold from me. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, verily Thou art the Most Generous, verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

<p>O handmaid of God, wife of his honor A.B., upon both of them be the Glory of God! In the name of the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing! This is a Day wherein all names and all things cry out with the most exalted call, giving the glad tidings of the appearance of the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Rising-Point of inspiration to all men and women. Yet the intoxication of vain desire hath prevented all from the Lord of earth and heaven, save those souls who, through the power of the Most Great Name, have rent asunder the veils of the peoples and turned toward the horizon of unity. Blessed art thou for having heard and recognized and turned toward the horizon of the Manifestation. And woe unto every handmaid who hath turned away from the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Existing. We beseech God that He may enable all the leaves to attain unto the recognition of the Divine Lote-Tree and deprive them not from the ocean of bounty. Today neither loftiness nor lowliness, poverty nor wealth, lineage nor descent, weakness nor strength can be observed. Whosoever hath recognized the peerless Beloved - his is true wealth and spiritual station. In this day the Queen of the realms hath not, before God, the weight of a mustard seed, although she speaketh in His Name and in her temple calleth upon the Lord of all mankind throughout all her days, and spendeth vast sums in promoting her own religion. Nevertheless she is deprived of the Sun of Revelation and barred from the Truth in Whose remembrance she is engaged. Now consider thine own station and the station of those leaves who are holding fast to the Divine Lote-Tree, and say: “Praise be to Thee, O Beloved of the worlds! And glory be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know! And bounty be to Thee, O Thou the Yearning of loving hearts!”</p>

Today countless treasures of divine knowledge have appeared from the treasury of the sciences of the Lord of all beings. Say: O servants of God, exalted be His glory! He has manifested Himself solely for the advancement and elevation of your stations. Strive that perchance you may not lag behind the peoples of the past in recognition, but rather surpass them. O you who gaze toward the horizon of the Manifestation! Sorrows have encompassed this Wronged One from all directions, for it is observed that this people, namely the people of the Bayan, are far lower and more worthless than the previous people. For those people heard from the Burning Bush the words “Verily I am God” and did not deny it, while these people, despite the fact that the Herald mentioned completely the movements, stillness, words and deeds of this Wronged One, nevertheless all turned away and rose up in opposition, and committed that which caused the Lord of the heavens to take to the dust of exile and choose a dwelling place. Were I to reveal to you and to My loved ones what has befallen Me at the hands of those who claimed to love Me, you would lament as those who have lost their children lament, and weep as lovers weep in separation. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having turned toward this servant of Thine and sent down unto him that which every letter thereof testifieth to Thy grace and bounty and might and grandeur and loving-kindness. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Compassionate to the downtrodden, to aid them to turn toward Thee and face the lights of Thy countenance.

Through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, thou hast drunk from the cup of divine knowledge and attained unto its effects. Say: O handmaidens, deprive not yourselves on this Day of God which has appeared, but take hold of the sealed wine that stands before all faces through His Name and drink it in His remembrance. This wine hath no likeness or equal. It is the Kawthar of divine love and the Salsabil of heavenly knowledge. Its fragrance quickeneth the world and bestoweth awareness. In place of intoxication it conferreth consciousness, and in place of headache it granteth detachment. Blessed be this wine and blessed be the one who attaineth unto it, despite those people of the Bayan who have broken the Covenant of the All-Merciful. O handmaiden of God! Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land and counsel them to purity and sanctity. The best garment in all the world for the handmaidens of God is chastity.

He hath aided the Cause of His Lord until He was imprisoned in this remote prison, and now from the direction of the prison He calleth out to all who are in the heavens and on earth, saying: “Worship none but God!” All the peoples of the earth combined have not prevented Him from the Cause of His Lord. Though ye help Him not, commit not that which would grieve His heart and cause the hearts of the Concourse on high to burn.

Were ye to discover that which hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of your Lord’s favor, ye would arise to serve Him and thank Him throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven.

<p>O ’Ali! O target of fate! O ’Ali! O thou who art pierced by the arrows of hatred! Hearken to the call of Him Who preceded thee in tribulation in the path of God, Creator of heaven. There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. All things have borne witness to what hath befallen you in the love of God, the Lord of Names. The winds lament for you, the thunder trembleth at your afflictions, and heaven weepeth, its tears the rain. The Youth in His prison remembereth your tribulations, detached from His own, for He hath sacrificed Himself for the life of the world. Thus hath He ascended the heaven of tribulation and calleth the people unto God, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Can anything prevent Him from that which He is bidden? Nay, by Him Who commandeth the winds! Can the might of kings frighten Him? Nay, by Him Who alternateth night and day! His likeness is as the sea - can the happenings of time prevent its waves? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Behold the sun - though the earth should quake, or the mountains fall and their roots be torn up, and people slay or be slain, it remaineth unperturbed and continueth to shed its radiance. Or like the winds that blow by the power of their Lord, and nothing can impede them. Thus do We set forth similitudes for thee. Glorify thy Lord’s praise at morn and eventide. Then stand firm in the Cause and fear not the factions. Soon shall We seize them as We seized the generations of old. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compelling, and when His promise cometh, severe in His chastisement. Soon shall the sun of glory rise from the horizon of My Cause and illumine all regions. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thou mayest rejoice in thy soul and arise to remember thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>

We have made mention of thee before, and before that before, and We make mention of thee in this Forbidden Tablet. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of the All-Merciful from thy Lord’s utterance, turn thee to the spot wherein lieth interred the first to believe in God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved, and say: O thou who art the first breeze that wafted from the garment of Glory and the first fragrance that was diffused from the direction of God, the Lord of Names! Upon thee be salutations, O Dawning-Place of immortality and Source of Command unto all who are in creation! Through thee was raised the heaven of bounty, through thee appeared the countenance of the Adored One, through thee was adorned the praised station, through thee gushed forth the springs of utterance amidst all contingent beings, and through thee wafted the breezes of God unto the peoples of all worlds. I testify that thou didst recognize the Intended One when He appeared in truth, and didst acknowledge the Hidden One, Whom none on earth could recognize save those whom thy Lord did will. Thou art the one through whom the Choice Wine was unsealed and the veil of fancy was rent asunder, until the Name of the Self-Subsisting appeared unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. I testify that thou didst fulfill God’s Covenant and His Testament, and wert so attracted by His verses that thou didst sacrifice thy spirit in His path. Blessed is the earth that hath been honored by thee, and the precincts that have been ennobled by thy presence, and the air that hath been mingled with thy breath. I beseech God through thee and implore Him to aid me in serving His Cause and to ordain for me that which shall profit me in this world and the world to come. He, verily, is the Giving, the Bountiful, the Manifest, the Responsive.</p>

Howbeit, We have concealed Our woes from all created things, lest they that are the embodiments of names in the kingdom of creation should be consumed away.</p>
<p>Be not then afflicted, and occupy thyself at all times with the remembrance of the Well-Beloved. Be not saddened by the sorrows of the world, nor gladdened by its joys, for with the swiftness of lightning both shall pass away and come to naught. Detach thine heart from all that perisheth, and enter thou the imperishable dominion. Render thanks unto the Well-Beloved that thou hast attained unto His love, a love that purifieth the soul of sickness and transgression, and answereth one’s wants and needs. Please God, thou wilt remain constant in His love, and wilt not deviate from the straight path of His Cause. The sign of those that love Him, however, is that they should walk in the ways of His good pleasure, and not in the pathway of their evil passions and desires. Abide thou ever neath the shadow of His mercy, and detach thyself from all save Him. Do thou convey Our salutation and blessing to all those handmaidens who are devoted unto Him.</p>

Know thou its worth and preserve it as the apple of thine eye. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the loved ones, especially to the two persons who were mentioned in thy letter. God will ordain for you what He willeth and will send down from the heaven of His bounty that which is best for you. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.</p>

<p>O ’Ali, son of Nasir of Lahijan! O ’Ali! God willing, through the blessings of the Most Great Name thou shalt be detached from the world and turned toward the Eternal Sovereign. Some among the servants have been so seized by vain imaginings that they have turned away from the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing One, and have fixed their gaze upon the croaking of the calumniators. Were one to observe carefully, thou wouldst find such souls to be worshippers of fancy and idle thoughts. Their tongues move and speak at the prompting of self and desire. They act according to their passions yet attribute it to the Truth. Strange it is that they have taken words contaminated by self and passion as proof, while remaining heedless and turning away from the divine verses through a single word of which the world and all within it were created. Today it is binding and obligatory upon all the loved ones to arise to serve the Cause and to forbid the servants and handmaidens from reprehensible and displeasing deeds and from vain and unworthy words. I swear by the Most Great Name that today the garment of the Cause hath been sullied by the acts and deeds of some. The fragrance of truth must waft from all. Nothing but pure deeds and goodly words have ever been or shall ever be worthy of God’s threshold. O friends! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One and ponder that which He hath commanded and which hath flowed from His Pen, that ye may attain unto that which God hath purposed. Ere long all shall return to dust. At that time nothing shall profit save pure deeds. And peace be upon him who followeth the command of thy Lord.</p>

He hath turned toward thee from His Most Glorious Horizon and addresseth thee in remembrance. Know thou the worth of this most exalted station and this greatest gift, and act in a manner befitting these divine days, that thou mayest attain His special favors. I swear by the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge, had the people - that is, they who claim to love - caused their own will and desire to be extinguished in the Will and Purpose of God, conditions other than those now visible would have been witnessed. Another world, another creation, and other ways would have appeared and become manifest. Persevere in that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Utterance specifically for thee and for the loved ones, that the effulgences of the suns of words may seize and illumine the heart. O ’Ali-Akbar! The Most Exalted Pen at all times calleth the peoples of the earth and guideth them to the Lord of the Return, yet hearing ears are rare. Beseech thou God that He may consume doubts and idle fancies through the fire of certitude. We have enjoined unity upon all the world, and it is the greatest means for the appearance of divine blessings and bounties, yet until now its effects have not become manifest. We implore the All-Powerful that He may adorn the world with this most wondrous and resplendent ornament and aid it to achieve that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him.

<p>O maidservant of God!</p>
<p>Render thanks unto the One true Beloved for having guided thee to recognize His own Self. Many are the daughters of kings and other notables who, through having been veiled from recognizing the Beauty of the All-Merciful, are not remembered by the Lord. Thou, however, hast been remembered by Him, and thy name set down by the Pen of His Command. Regard not this, that in these days, to outward seeming, they live in luxury and honour. For I swear by Him Who hath made true honour the exclusive portion of His loved ones, that though they repose on jewelled couches, in the eyes of God they dwell upon the dust; and soon shall they all return, in the utmost poverty and abasement, to that place wherein is neither lamp nor couch, neither friend nor comforter.</p>
<p>Thou, however, and other maidservants of God like unto thee, though ye be seated on the dust, are, in the eyes of God, established upon the seats of honour; and when finally ye return unto your Lord, ye shall ascend with matchless glory unto the realms above. Then shall the whole sublime and holy company of the maids of heaven come forth to greet you, and inhale from you the sweet savours of the love of God. Ever hast thou had both wealth and honour, for the love of God hath been with thee, and – God willing – shall remain with thee for evermore; and naught that hath been created in the heaven or the earth is equal to a single atom of this love. Dirhams and dinars are not the measure of true wealth; its measure, rather, is the love of Him Who is the Beauteous, the Unconstrained.</p>
<p>How many are they who, though rich in dinars, are yet the poorest of God’s creatures; for, even as is witnessed, each day their greed for gain increaseth, and their avarice waxeth more intense.</p>
<p>O maidservant of God! Hold not cheap the precious gem of love, and remain thou steadfast in His love. Such is Our perspicuous and mighty counsel unto thee.</p>

<p>This Wronged One hath enjoined upon all people to observe what is praiseworthy and forbidden what is blameworthy. He beseecheth God - glorified be His majesty - to adorn all with the ornament of trustworthiness, godliness, truthfulness and purity. If no trace of humanity is manifested from someone, dried bones are better than they. All are poor before the manifestations of His riches, and weak before the revelations of His power. One must turn with one’s whole heart to the Supreme Horizon. In truth, none attaineth unto this most exalted station, this most sublime summit and this ultimate goal except by washing the heart with the water of recognition and burning away all else save God with the fire of His love. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls who have accepted, remained firm, become assured, walked uprightly, been well-pleased, given pleasure, and acted; and a hundred thousand woes upon those souls who have turned away, denied, remained heedless, and forsaken. God hath ever gazed upon what is praiseworthy and commanded its observance, yet most of the people of the earth have spoken unjustly and concealed the Sun of Justice behind the dark clouds thereof. These deeds have appeared in the form of bullets and cannons, as hath been witnessed. We beseech God to adorn all with the ornament of forgiveness. Verily He is powerful over all things. Your petition was received and read. This imprisoned Wronged One beseecheth God to assist you to perform such deeds as shall endure as long as His names endure.

No sooner, however, had He been made manifest through Whose word the kingdom of names and the heaven of eternity were created, than they broke away from Him and disbelieved in the greatest of Thy signs.

Thou must purify thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, that thou mayest be enabled to take thy stand in My love and be of those who are firmly established. Beware lest thou turn unto those in whose hearts thou findest hatred for the Youth, neither associate nor commune with them. Then turn away from such as these and draw nigh unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Arise to promote the Cause in the name of thy Lord, then aid the Youth with whatsoever thou art able, and walk not save in My straight and manifest path. Soon shalt thou hear from the opposers that which shall rend asunder the hearts of those near unto God. When this cometh to pass, remain thou steadfast and be of those who are firm. Thus do We recount unto thee from the tidings of the unseen, that thou mayest know thy Lord apart from all else and be among those who are steadfast in His love. We have indeed ordained for thee in the Tablet an honorable and glorious station, shouldst thou remain firm in the Cause and not be shaken in the hour wherein all who are in the heavens and on earth shall be shaken. Cast the world behind thee, for it shall never suffice thee, but what shall suffice thee is thy Lord, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Inaccessible. Then make mention from Our presence to those who are around thee and with thee from among the loved ones of God, if thou findest in their hearts love for the Youth; otherwise, leave them to themselves and abide under gracious protection.</p>

<p>O Dyer! The entire world hath been created for the service of God’s Cause, and all the Prophets gave the people of the earth the glad-tidings of this wondrous Day, which in the holy divine Books is known as the Day of God. And when the Hidden Mystery and Treasured Secret dawned forth from the horizon of Will, all were found to be veiled save whom God willeth. The cause of mankind’s veiling was the greatest veil, and the manifestations of this veil are the divines of the age, even as He hath said: “Knowledge is the most great veil.” How many were the divines who, at the appearance of the Lord of Names, arose in opposition, and how many were those whom people counted as ignorant, who in the days of God attained unto the ultimate station of man, which is the station of the knowledge of God. Although in this Most Great Revelation many of the divines have been honored with recognition of the Lord of Eternity, yet most were seen to be opposed and in denial. These heedless souls are the dawning-places of suppositions and idle fancies, and the heedless among the servants, through following these souls, remained veiled and deprived of the divine revelation and heavenly inspiration. O Dyer! God willing, thou shalt attain unto the divine coloring, which is sanctified from the diverse colors of the world. Praise be to God that thou hast been favored with divine grace and blessed with recognition of the Manifestation of His Own Self. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for this great bounty.

However, this laxity in expressing love did not arise from the severance of the thread of love, and this negligence in showing eagerness did not stem from forgetting the covenant and pledge of affection. Rather, in the essence of the inner secret and hidden reality, the seas of fidelity were always surging and in motion, and in the heart and soul the lights and radiance of the sun of love were shining. If there was negligence in outward expression in the world of appearance regarding the spiritual messenger and heavenly letter in its coming and going, there was no shortcoming - for a ruined village pays no tax or tithe. This is because that inner connection has no severance or weakness, though this correspondence and communication may often be interrupted and suspended. Allah is Most Great! What a paradise has been opened in these days, and what a carpet of divine unity has been spread, such that if a servant among God’s servants be in the East of the world and another servant in the West, always does the easterner inhale the holy divine fragrances from the direction of the West, and this westerner catches the sweet scents of the spirit of love from the East. It is as if this distance of a hundred thousand leagues has taken on the ruling of a single step, and these countless waypoints have become as a mere span, for this vast distance can in no way prevent or block - and this is a truth in which there is no doubt, were people moving in the atmosphere of the spirit.</p>

<p>My most Ancient and Most Great Love! Your remembrance hath inspired Me to address thee, though thou hast forgotten Me. I entered into the Most Great Prison by reason of what the hands of the oppressors had wrought. Even shouldst thou forget, We shall not forget thee, as thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, doth testify. We have withheld the Pen outwardly lest there should descend upon thee that which would sadden thy heart. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to make thee one who rendeth asunder the veils and resolveth matters in their beginning and their end, and to exalt thee to such a station that thou mayest become a standard of guidance among all creatures, that thereby thy remembrance may be established by the Supreme Pen and thy name among the worlds. I desire to remember thee at all times and send unto thee that which will diffuse the fragrance of the divine Robe throughout all possibility, yet as We are mindful of wisdom, We have been patient and long-suffering. He, verily, is the All-Patient, the Mighty, the Great. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and speaking forth this wise Remembrance. By God! The treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal it. All things shall soon perish, but that which hath flowed from the Pen of Revelation shall endure. This, verily, is a certain truth. Grieve not over anything. He protecteth whomsoever He willeth, though he be in the sea, or in the mouth of the serpent, or between the hands of the idolaters. The Cause is in His grasp. He withholdeth from whomsoever He willeth what He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist thee to exalt His Cause and to ordain for thee the good of this world and of the next, even as We promised thee aforetime when thou wert with Us, which promise We fulfilled, and We have mentioned the latter in this wondrous Tablet. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have turned with their hearts towards the direction of the Beloved and who were among the sincere ones.</p>

<p>God the Exalted, through the tongue of His Prophets and Messengers, promised all the peoples of the earth this most holy, most mighty and most luminous Day, that all might prepare themselves for the divine presence and not let slip their opportunity. Yet when the Sun of Revelation shone forth from the horizon of God’s Will, all turned away and rose up in opposition. Would that they had been content with such actions! Rather, they rose up to calumniate and issued decrees for the shedding of pure blood. There is no land wherein their blood was not shed, and no air unto which their sighs did not ascend. Verily thy Lord is the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing. These abominable deeds have been and will be the cause of tribulation and hardship for all on earth. For many years afflictions have not ceased from the earth, but flow like torrential rain. If they subside in one place, they flare up in another. And the holy, assured, content and well-pleased souls - whatever befalls them has been and will be in the path of God. If they are martyred, their spirits ascend to the divine Companion and find their dwelling in the highest Paradise. By God’s life! Theirs is the best end and most excellent return. But the oppressive souls are afflicted with the flames of divine servants’ wrath, and after their spirits depart they are chastised with a torment a hundred thousand times more severe than earthly punishment. Thus does He inform thee, with Whom is the knowledge of the Book. Afflictions will not cease until they repent and return unto God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Mighty - to the nephew of Jinab-i-Haji Muhammad-Rida, upon them both be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>God, exalted be His glory, has fulfilled His promise and made manifest His Day, according to His blessed and exalted words: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” However, the unjust people in this blessed Day have deprived themselves of the presence of the Self-Subsisting Lord and have clung to vain imaginings. Every created thing calls out in a most sweet voice, summoning the servants to the Creator of existence, yet their deeds have prevented most from turning to Him and have deprived them of the Days of God. Say: O servants, fear God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him Who has come to you with a clear Command and mighty sovereignty. Today the Divine Lote Tree in the highest Paradise gives the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Names to all beings. Every eye illumined with the light of recognition has attained to witnessing Him, and every ear cleansed of ancient tales has been honored to hear. O people of God! Strive that perchance you may deliver a soul from the darkness of vain imaginings and guide it to the Dayspring of certitude.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself and whatsoever Thou didst promise Thy servants in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the lights of Thy Throne to aid me to perform such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy servant turning unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Ordain for him that whereby his mention and his name shall endure amongst Thy servants and Thy creation. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon him who hath believed in God, the Lord of Lords, in the final return.</p>

<p>My God, my God! I testify that Thy mercy hath preceded all created things and Thy grace hath encompassed all possibilities. I acknowledge the sanctification of Thy Being and the abstraction of Thine Essence from the recognition of all existences. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion, and by Him through Whom Thou hast guided the servants to the ocean of Thy recognition and the sun of Thy grace, that Thou forgive me and those who have drunk the wine of unity from the cup of Thy bestowal. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee to assist me in all conditions to turn to Thee and to repent at the door of Thy generosity. Then ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily Thou art the Lord of the Throne and the dust. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<p>Praise be to the Best-Beloved of the worlds that thou hast been made the recipient of His infinite bounties and hast not been debarred from the direction of His oneness. This was due to none other than the sincerity which was at times manifested from thee. Though it may not be apparent to thee now, God was and is aware of it. Know thou the value of this most great favor. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Best-Beloved of the worlds, for having enabled me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause. I testify that Thou art indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, be thou not sorrowful. By My life, thou art near! This testimony which hath flowed from the Pen of Ancient Days sufficeth thee. Glory in God’s testimony unto thee, for all things have been and shall ever be dependent upon His testimony. Praise be to God that thou didst attain His presence, though it was before the time of Manifestation. However, in those days the fragrance of the divine breezes was wafting with utmost delicacy and gentleness. Blessed is he who hath attained, witnessed and heard that which was uttered by the Dawning-Place of his Lord’s verses, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>It is not permissible for thee to direct thyself to this quarter, for the good of the Cause. For this Wronged One is imprisoned, and the highway robbers lie in ambush. In such circumstances, it is necessary that thou protect thyself with the utmost care, that perchance through thee some service may be rendered that will cause the exaltation of the Word. Yea, if the way were open, We would have summoned thee to Our presence. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal.

Say: O servants! The Day is His Day and the Cause is His Cause, and this is that News wherewith the Prophets and Chosen Ones gave glad tidings unto the servants. Today grace hath encompassed the world and the ocean of proof surgeth before all faces and the voice of Him Who conversed on Sinai is raised. Deprive not yourselves and withhold not yourselves from this matchless and peerless bounty. With the power of certitude and the light of proof, aim ye for the ultimate goal and loftiest summit, in such wise that the people of the world shall be powerless to hinder you. Today the matter which, in the sight of God, is foremost and most preeminent above all matters is steadfastness, inasmuch as the world and its peoples are seen to be scattered and at variance.

Tribulations have not prevented them from the Most Great Source, nor have ordeals veiled them from beholding the lights of Beauty. In all conditions they gaze upon the Friend and are detached from all else.</p>

I swear by the Most Great Name - they have ascended to a station that transcends mention, description, and explanation. If you observe with the most pure vision and reflect with the most luminous heart, you will see this is a station of joy, not grief. Intensity in His path has been the sovereign of ease, and tribulation in His love the king of comfort. All that is witnessed in this world will perish and vanish, while for His loved ones are ordained stations that will endure as long as God’s kingdom endures. Strive in these fleeting days to attain these lofty, eternal stations. And may the glory rest upon you, upon those with you, and upon those whom tribulations have not prevented from turning toward the sanctuary of their Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.

His mercy hath encompassed all who dwell in the realm of existence and hath taken precedence over all else.

Blessed are those souls who arise today with spiritual qualities and goodly deeds to aid the Cause of the Lord of all creation. All the loved ones should, God willing, manifest perfect love and affection and not fall short in helping one another. The meaning of “fellowship” that hath been revealed in the Book of God is this: that each of the believers should regard others as they regard themselves, that is, they should not consider themselves superior, and the wealthy should not deprive the poor of their wealth, and whatever they choose for themselves of good things, they should choose the same for other believers. This is the meaning of fellowship. The limit of fellowship extendeth to this degree, and to exceed it is reckoned before God as proceeding from selfish desires and carnal inclinations. God protect us and you from all that He loveth not. God willing, all should remember Him with utmost sanctity and purity. Verily He is the Commander, the Hearing, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>O Mulla ’Abdu’l-Husayn, the Most Ancient and Most Great! A mention from Us to one who hath remembered his Lord, that the call of his Lord may attract him to a station ordained in the Tablets. The Face hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s will, and the Nightingale of Eternity hath warbled in the Kingdom of Creation, and the Lamp hath been lit. All things have spoken in praise of thy Lord, while they that are heedless are numbered among the dead. This is a Day wherein the Path hath been laid, and the Balance set up, and the Command belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Know thou then that thy letter hath come before the Face, and there hath been revealed for thee that which hath illumined the horizons. Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken in remembrance of the All-Merciful, and the heart that hath turned, and the face that hath directed itself toward the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Arise to serve God and remember Him with such steadfastness as shall make feet to stand firm. Say: Gather ye together around the Law which We have ordained in truth, that the backs of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, may be broken. Seize ye these days and then gather together around that which God, the Lord of all mankind, hath willed. O servant! Do thou aid thy Lord through utterance in such wise that the fragrance of the Garment may be wafted among all contingent beings. God willing, mayest thou ever speak in praise of the Truth and strive for the unity of hearts. It is most evident that discord causeth separation, while unity and harmony give rise to the manifestation of power and might. Gird up thy loins to serve, and guide the people to the Most Great Name, detached from all else. This is the binding decree that hath shone forth from the horizon of the Pen of the Ancient of Days. Hold fast unto it, detached from the worlds. Verily, the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>A mention from Us to one who heard the Call and turned to the Supreme Horizon - the station wherein the Lote Tree of the Uttermost End speaks forth from the luminous spot: “Verily there is no God but I, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”</p>
<p>We mentioned thee before and mention thee at this time. Be thou thankful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Wronged One, the All-Mentioned, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou Rememberer, the All-Knowing.” I testify that Thou didst arise with the Cause and didst manifest that which was hidden from time immemorial and treasured within Thy knowledge. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Know thou the value of this Book. Nothing thou hast heard or seen can equal it - to this testifieth every fair-minded and informed one. The fragrance of utterance hath been diffused throughout all possibility. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who hath appeared and made manifest His straight Path.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy father who drank the choice wine from the hand of My bounty and soared in My atmosphere and acknowledged that which My tongue acknowledged and confessed that which My Pen proclaimed, and attained unto the Supreme Companion when he sought the most exalted Summit - the station which none save God, the Mighty, the Wise, hath understood. I testify that he heard the Call and responded to the Lord of all beings and turned to the Face after the passing of all things. Blessed is the tongue that uttered his remembrance and the soul that turned unto him, pure for the sake of its Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned! Rejoice in what hath been sent down unto thee, then beseech thy Lord to strengthen thee in that which will cause thy remembrance to endure through the eternity of His most beautiful names. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Glory be upon thee and upon him who hath attained unto this mighty station.</p>

Say: By God, he neither nourishes nor avails, were ye of them that know. Say: Abandon vain imaginings and turn with attentive ears unto the Lord of all creation, then hearken to that which He proclaims from this mighty Prison. Thus has My Most Exalted Pen spoken, when We were in manifest sorrow. Grieve thou not over anything, but trust in all circumstances in the One, the All-Informed. He ordains for thee whatsoever He willeth through His authority. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon her who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Blessed art thou and she, and her father who hath attained unto the Most Exalted Companion - to this beareth witness the Lord of creation in this Tablet through which the sincere ones inhale the fragrance of God, the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-’Ali, who was martyred in the path of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The glory be upon thee and upon those who found from thee the fragrance of sincerity in this Cause whereby hearts were stirred. Blessed is he who remembereth thee and praiseth thee and turneth toward thy grave out of love for God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus have We made mention of him who turned unto God and was steadfast in His Cause, the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Protected.</p>

O My servant who art mentioned in the precincts of My throne! Hearken unto My call: verily there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed is thy father in that We manifested through him one who turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon in such wise that the Most Glorious Pen hath borne witness unto him in this station which hath been named by all names in a clear tablet. Thy letter was present and the servant who standeth before the Wronged One read it, and We have answered thee with that whereby every tongue hath spoken, every seated one hath arisen, every sleeping one hath awakened, every extinguished one hath been enkindled, and every frozen one hath been quickened. Thus hath My Pen spoken as a grace from Me unto thee, that thou mayest be among the thankful. Soon shall the tongues of the world speak in remembrance of those who fulfilled My Covenant and turned with radiant faces toward the countenance of their Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Object of worship of the world and the Desire of the nations! I beseech Thee by the Lamp of Thy Cause and the Ocean of Thy knowledge and the Sun of Thy beauty to ordain for me the reward of those who attained unto Thy presence and circumambulated Thy most great Throne by Thy leave.

A remembrance from Us to him who hath attained unto the ocean of grace and drunk therefrom through this wondrous Name, and who hath inhaled the fragrances of the All-Glorious when they wafted throughout all creation, and who was of them that have prospered. O servant! Hearken unto that which the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttereth in this station which God hath made to transcend all contingent things: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Generous. Say: Through My appearance that which was hidden hath appeared, and through My call all things have spoken even as the Tongue of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath spoken. Through My arising the Resurrection hath arisen, and through My movement all things have moved and turned toward My sanctified and luminous horizon. Do men imagine that they can prevent this Tongue from the praise of the All-Merciful? Nay, by His Self! It speaketh that which it is bidden by One mighty and powerful. Whenever We have tasted the bitterness of tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all names, We have found it sweeter than honey and more refreshing than the waters of Paradise. Woe unto them that wander in the wilderness of error and have cast aside the Command of God through the calumnies of their own selves - they are assuredly among the perishing ones. Would that I were alone in the land of exile, but God hath ordained what He willeth, and He is My desire. Blessed are they that attain! We have informed the servants, when We arrived at the Most Great Prison, of that which lay hidden in the knowledge of their Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Blessed is he who hath recognized that which God hath intended in the Tablets which have been sent down in truth from the heaven of the loving providence of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

Blessed art thou for having immersed thyself in the ocean of divine knowledge and found the fragrance of the garment when it was wafted throughout the worlds.

Hold fast in all conditions unto the cord of wisdom, lest there occur that whereby the hearts of the weak would be troubled. Thou shouldst give thanks unto God for having been mentioned by the tongue of thy Lord and for this luminous Tablet having been revealed unto thee.

<p>In the Name of the Most Great, the Most Glorious! Glorified is He Who speaks at all times: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.” They who have turned away, these are the companions of the fire. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful, and follow not your idle fancies. Follow Him through Whom the proof hath been established and the evidence made clear. Beware lest ye claim that which hath not been ordained for you. The Cause hath been completed and that which ye were promised in the scrolls and tablets hath appeared. Create not disorder in the land - verily We have adorned it with justice through this grace which hath appeared and before which necks have bowed low. Be ye helpers of Our Cause. Beware lest ye transgress what We have set forth in the Book. We have chosen tribulations for the reformation of the world and the unity of all therein. Beware lest ye speak that which causeth discord in the Cause. Fear God, O ye who are endued with insight! Adorn yourselves with the raiment of servitude unto God, the True One, that the regions might be illumined with the lights of this dawning. Through servitude is revealed the station of creation; through it do faces turn unto the Mighty, the Bestower. How many among the people of the Bayan, when they saw that the Cause had been exalted, laid claim to that which caused the Cause to be lost in the lands. When the breezes of tests blew, they veiled their faces in fear for themselves, and when the winds of assurance passed, they came forth and opposed God, the Lord of creation. Thus have We recounted unto thee, that thou mayest remember those who carve out idols each day and cleave unto them. They are naught but in manifest error. Arise to serve the Cause through God’s might and power, then remind those who have broken the Covenant. Let not the affairs of the people grieve thee. Fix thy gaze upon the Truth - verily thy Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Be thou a servant of God’s Cause among His servants. He, verily, aideth through utterance whoso helpeth Him. He is in truth the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>

<p>He is the Exalted, the Sublime, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Glorified is He, who hath manifested Himself in His splendid Glory through the power of truth, thus all that dwell in the heavens and on earth were adorned with His presence, save those who turned away from His Face, and were in truth sure to perish. Blessed is he, whom the fragrances of the Day of God hath quickened and caused to be detached from all else.</p>
<p>This is the Day of Prophetic Cry, well is it with him who, with wisdom, calleth out This exalted and mighty Name. Thus hath been prescribed unto you by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>It doth not beseem man to become a source of sedition; nay, rather, he should endeavor towards that which will cause the affairs of all that dwell on earth to prosper; thus hath the True One proclaimed, He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Aid thou Me with good deeds - this truly behooveth ye, if ye be of them that comprehend this truth. For every day a portion hath been ordained in the Book of God. When the appointed time is come, that which He willeth is achieved. He verily reigneth over whatsoever He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Those who had cast away the Cause of God, they had verily abandoned the stronghold of justice, and are among the heedless.</p>
<p>The King of Eternity hath come for the betterment of the world. If the people but knew, they would have circumambulated His Throne. Verily, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They are like unto mere children, and our Lord is the Educator of the world. If We but willed, we could have seized them with a single word from Us, yet the mercy of the Lord, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Powerful, supersedes His wrath.</p>
<p>Walk in the path of thy Lord, for He is the most merciful.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who, wholly for the sake of God, calleth the people to the path of His Lord. Be thou shepherds unto His sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves. Thus instructeth thee He with Whom is the knowledge of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Well is it with thee that thou hast forsaken thyself and turned towards the exalted realms, and attained unto the days of God and the knowledge of this Announcement, at which the mountain of corrupt desires was crushed and the Day-Star of divine guidance shone from the horizon of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Resplendent.</p>

<p>A Prayer Revealed by Baha’u’llah on the Occasion of the Ridvan Festival</p>
<p>He Is God!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! This is one of the days of the Ridvan Festival whereon a dwelling-place in the Prison hath been embellished through the presence of the Exponent of Thy Beauty, Who deigned to accept an invitation at the earnest request of one that hath been carried away by longing and desire.</p>
<p>Magnified be Thou, inasmuch as Thou hast shone forth above the horizon of the Prison with so dazzling a splendour that all parts of the world have been illumined by virtue of the bounty Thou hast conferred upon those that have entered beneath Thy shadow and were admitted within Thy precincts. On this Day Thou didst unloose Thy tongue with holy utterances and scattered abroad pearls of inner meaning and exposition upon all the denizens of the entire creation. Through the influence of this chalice, do Thou revive O Lord, all the dwellers of the earth and ordain for the people of Baha – they that yearn to behold Thy face but have been turned away by reason of what the hands of Thine enemies have wrought – ordain for them that which will profit them, O Thou Who art the Lord of names and the Possessor of earth and heavens! Grant them then a portion from the outpourings of Thy mercy in these days, when every abased one is exalted, every believer is adorned with grace, every dejected soul is stirred up with joy, every poor one is enriched and every seeker hath voiced Thy praise.</p>
<p>O Lord! Glory be to Thee for Thou hast singled out Thy loved ones, distinguished them from among Thy people and hast turned Thy gaze towards them from this place, wherein the Tabernacle of Thy Cause is incarcerated. O Lord! Hinder them not from attaining the things Thou dost possess, but cause their hearts to be enraptured by the sweet savours of Thy divine Revelation, in such wise that they may, thereby, be detached from all else but Thee and may set their faces towards the court of Thy favour and loving kindness. Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou willest; powerful art Thou over all things, and lauded art Thou, O Desire of the worlds!</p>

Protect her within the tabernacle of Thy Cause from that which Thy good-pleasure abhorreth, then give her to drink of the Kawthar of everlasting life through the hands of Thy bounties, and ordain for her that which shall profit her in every world of Thy worlds.

<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God! Thou art He Who by a word of His mouth hath revolutionized the entire creation, and by a stroke of His pen hath divided Thy servants one from another. I bear witness, O my God, that through a word spoken by Thee in this Revelation all created things were made to expire, and through yet another word all such as Thou didst wish were, by Thy grace and bounty, endued with new life.</p>
<p>I render Thee thanks, therefore, and extol Thee, in the name of all them that are dear to Thee, for that Thou hast caused them to be born again, by reason of the living waters which have flowed down out of the mouth of Thy will. Since Thou didst quicken them by Thy bounteousness, O my God, make them steadfastly inclined, through Thy graciousness, towards Thy will; and since Thou didst suffer them to enter into the Tabernacle of Thy Cause, grant by Thy grace that they may not be kept back from Thee.</p>
<p>Unlock, then, to their hearts, O my God, the portals of Thy knowledge, that they may recognize Thee as One Who is far above the reach and ken of the understanding of Thy creatures, and immeasurably exalted above the strivings of Thy people to hint at Thy nature, and may not follow every clamorous impostor that presumeth to speak in Thy name. Enable them, moreover, O my Lord, to cleave so tenaciously to Thy Cause that they may remain unmoved by the perplexing suggestions of them who, prompted by their desires, utter what hath been forbidden unto them in Thy Tablets and Thy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Thou art well aware, O my Lord, that I hear the howling of the wolves which appear in Thy servants’ clothing. Keep safe, therefore, Thy loved ones from their mischief, and enable them to cling steadfastly to whatsoever hath been manifested by Thee in this Revelation, which no other Revelation within Thy knowledge hath excelled.</p>
<p>Do Thou destine for them, O my Lord, that which will profit them. Illumine, then, their eyes with the light of Thy knowledge, that they may see Thee visibly supreme over all things, and resplendent amidst Thy creatures, and victorious over all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth. Powerful art Thou to do Thy pleasure. No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, Whose help is implored by all men.</p>

I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Merciful to the servants, by Thy Name before which all names bow down in adoration, and by the light of Thy countenance before which all on earth and in heaven humble themselves, and by the Crimson Ark which Thou didst ordain especially for the people of Baha in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’, to assist me in Thy remembrance and praise and enable me to do what befitteth Thy days. I testify, O my God, to Thy oneness and Thy singleness and to that which Thou didst reveal unto Thy Prophets and Thy Chosen Ones. O Lord! I have heard Thy call, turned to Thy horizon, recognized Thy Revelation and hastened to the Dawning-Place of Thy verses. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Name and by Thy Most August Self not to deprive me of that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as acknowledge Thy unity and such of Thy creatures as are sincere. O Lord! I have clung to the cord of Thy loving-kindness and held fast to the hem of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee by Thy grace and bounty not to disappoint me of that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this world. I know not what is within Thy Self; Thou knowest what is within mine. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Send down Thy blessings, O my God, upon them that have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, who have not broken Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, who hastened unto Thee when Thy call was raised, and who strove in Thy path with befitting striving. These are honored servants whom neither the might of the opposers nor the power of the deniers could frighten. They arose and proclaimed: “God is our Lord and the Lord of the angels and the Spirit and the Lord of all in the heavens and on earth.” Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of the One Friend</p>
<p>There is no doubt that His Name Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, in what he did intended the victory of Truth and the exaltation of the Word of God. However, it occurred without wisdom, and all are today commanded to act with wisdom. Although he thought he was acting according to wisdom, he was mistaken. We have forgiven him out of Our grace, for He is verily the Ancient Bestower of Grace. None may object to him, for We are the Judge. We have mentioned him in various Tablets. This is truly a great station. Blessed is the one who arises with strength to remove differences among the loved ones and establish love and affection between them. He is of those who have aided the Cause of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. No harm has been or is greater to the Cause of God than discord, for if numerous souls act without wisdom and openly and manifestly speak the Word of God among people, undoubtedly this matter will cause agitation and clamor among the people. However, this has not and does not harm the foundation of the Cause itself, though the souls acting thus have acted contrary to the Command of God by departing from wisdom and becoming the cause of the destruction of weak souls. Through discord, harm befalls the very root of the Tree, and beyond this, opposition to God’s Command occurs, along with the dispersion of united souls, the waste of the Cause among the servants, and the bewilderment of weak souls - all of these things come to pass. O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Avoid discord, for through it the pure cup of mystical knowledge is sullied among all created things. Thus does My Most Exalted Pen counsel you from this manifest Prison.</p>

Verily, He cannot be indicated by any indication, nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan from God, the Lord of all worlds.” By God the Truth! This is a gem more precious than all the gems of the world, and all the treasures of the earth cannot equal it. To this testifieth every fair-minded and insightful one. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the Most Merciful and follow not your idle fancies. Follow that which ye have been commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Informed. Beware lest the lowing of the calf hold you back from Him Who speaketh at the heart of the world: “Verily, there is no God but I, the Forgiving, the Generous.” Cast away vain imaginings and hold fast to the cord of certitude, by the command of One Who commandeth, Who is All-Knowing.

Among the people are those who turned away, those who denied, and those who cast it behind their backs, clinging to the idle fancies of the polytheists - they who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, denied His proof and His evidence, and uttered that which caused the dwellers of Paradise and the people of this luminous station to lament. Say: Be fair, O people of the earth! By what proof did ye believe, and for what reason did ye turn away from this momentous announcement? Fear God, O people, and follow not him who forbade the servants from drawing nigh unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Thus hath the ocean of knowledge shown thee its waves and the heaven of utterance its stars, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful. The glory that proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon those who hesitated not when they heard the call, but drew near with illumined hearts and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!”</p>

<p>It is submitted that your grief and sorrow has not become so manifest as to eliminate or remove your loving correspondence and affectionate communications. However, since these conditions of grief and sorrow are attributes of the self, therefore purification and detachment from them is necessary, just as one of the Prophets asked: “O my God, how can I attain unto Thee?” He replied: “Cast thy self aside and then approach.” Thus it becomes clear that through the deliberation of pure and sanctified hearts, one must become purified and sanctified from the evils and sorrows of the self, and this is of God’s grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. Although what befell your honor darkened the arena of existence, both seen and unseen - it was as if the sun of joy became concealed and the moon of gladness eclipsed, the maidens of beauty remained hidden behind veils of glory, and matchless countenances became clothed and concealed in garments of limitation. The eye of the cloud wept crimson tears and the horizon of heaven rained blood from the realm of blindness. However, since these matters pertain to divine decree, their acceptance is necessary and patience in them is obligatory, for divine trials and endless tribulations are among God’s ways with His loved ones and His practice among His servants, and you will find no change or alteration in His way. Therefore all trials, afflictions and tribulations, both hidden and manifest, are beloved and acceptable. There are many more details which the bearer, if he attains your presence, will submit.</p>

<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I know not by what remembrance to raise the banners of Thy guidance for the sincere among Thy servants. Should I remember Thee as the Sovereign of kings - this station pertaineth to the servants. Should I describe Thee as the Manifestation of Light - this matter returneth to the Daysprings of Manifestation. Should I say that Thou art the Lord of the Kingdom - this is a remembrance belonging to the people of the realm of might and a description fitting the denizens of the Kingdom. And should I sanctify Thee above all this and above all that the mystics know - this is an attribute wherewith Thou didst describe from aforetime the Manifestations of Thy Self and the Daysprings of Thy Cause. By Thy glory! I am bewildered before Thee, for if this servant of Thine were to remember Thee by what Thou hast inspired him of the gems of the mysteries of Thy Word, Thy loved ones would be thunderstruck, for this is a mystery that souls cannot bear and minds cannot endure. And were I to remember Thee by what hath been remembered before - this would not be acceptable.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou! I beseech Thee by the lamp of Thy divine Essence in the niche of Thy holy Oneness to inspire Thy servants with that which will make them independent of all save Thee and sanctified from all except Thyself. Then send down upon Thy servant whom Thou hast named with the letters Ra and Da from the gems of Thy hidden knowledge and the subtleties of Thy treasured mysteries, that he may gather Thy servants in Thy love and lead them to the canopy of Thy presence. Then make this book for him a garment of Thy beauty and a robe of Thy majesty, that he may inhale the fragrance of eternity from the Egypt of reunion. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Beloved. Cast then the word of glorification upon those who have journeyed in their inner selves and migrated unto God in their hearts and descended upon Him in their outward being, that the grace from His presence may reach all worlds.</p>

We have risen this day through God’s bounty, mercy, grace and bestowal, and We were speaking in remembrance when My Most Great Branch arrived and mentioned you and what was manifested from you in My days and your days. We have remembered you with a remembrance that no remembrance can equal, and We have revealed for you that whose fragrance shall never be cut off, and We have turned toward you with a favor that all the treasures of the heavens and earth cannot equal. O Buzurg, O My Afnan! Upon you be My glory and My mercy. The Tongue of Grandeur and the Most Exalted Pen bear witness that your days were adorned with service to the Cause of God. In truth, you performed that which became the cause of the Most Great Remembrance in God’s Book, and assuredly the reward for what was manifested shall be made manifest. Verily He is with you and heareth your call and seeth your turning and orientation toward Him. He is indeed the Compassionate, the Generous, the True, the Faithful. All that you sent arrived in days when the regions of the world were darkened through the tyranny of the oppressors while the Wronged One was established upon the Most Pure and Luminous Throne in the prison of ’Akka. The oppressors imagined that what they had wrought would extinguish the light of God’s Cause. How evil was that which they imagined! Soon they shall witness its exaltation and ascendancy and the appearance of that which hath been ordained by the Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O people! By God’s life, that which never appeared in the world hath appeared. Blessed are they who possess understanding.

Were ye to reflect upon the perpetuity of the Kingdom and the dominion, ye would not claim knowledge of the unseen, for ye have turned away from Him through Whom the unseen is known and through Whom His signs have shone forth from the horizon of power. Do ye deny Him Who speaketh from His presence while claiming servitude to the unseen? By God! Ye are in naught but heedlessness and error.</p>

Rather, remain steadfast in thy love for thy Lord and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made Thyself known unto me after most of the people of the lands turned away from Thee. O Lord!

Say: Is there any doubt concerning it, or concerning that which ye possess, if ye be fair and not of the wrongdoers?

<p>The Most Exalted Pen counsels His loved ones regarding two matters: First, wisdom, so that no harm may befall anyone and weak souls not be kept back from the shore of the sea of oneness; and second, unity and concord, for great harm befalls the Cause of God from discord - shun it and be among the steadfast. Today every soul must hold fast to that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. Blessed are they that act. Until now, whatsoever hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen for the reformation of the world and the removal of corruption hath not been accepted, as evidenced by one who dwelt for some time before the Divine Throne and heard with his own ears the counsels and exhortations of the Wronged One of the world, yet after being dismissed from the Most Holy Court […] and spoke contrary to the divine command. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the Cause that contention, corruption, conflict and whatsoever disturbeth hearts have ever been rejected and condemned by this Wronged One, as attested by what hath been sent down in the Tablets from the Pen of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, you must remind the loved ones of the All-Merciful of this Tablet, that perchance they may hold fast to what God hath ordained and not defile the ears created to hear the call of God with the words of any speaker. Let them fix their gaze upon the horizon of the Cause and upon what is revealed from His presence, for verily He sufficeth all, and He is the Commander, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon thee and upon those who follow the laws and commandments of God that shine forth from this wondrous horizon.</p>

Verily it is the Messenger of Truth to all lands, that it may remind the people of its exalted station and acquaint them with its supreme position and its most glorious habitation, and show them its wondrous beauty and its most elevated station and its most impregnable and mighty sovereignty. By the life of God! As it walketh, acceptance walketh at its right hand and tranquility at its left, while before it wave the banners of glory and behind it march the hosts of dignity. To this doth He Who causeth the rivers to flow bear witness; verily He is the Knower of all things. It proclaimeth and saith: “O concourse of humanity! I have come unto you from the presence of the Most Great Truth to make known unto you its loftiness and exaltation, its beauty and perfection, its station and glory and splendor, that ye may perchance find a path unto its straight way. By God! Whoso adorneth himself with this supreme ornament, he is verily of the people of this luminous station. Beware, O people, lest ye cast it to the claws of falsehood. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Its likeness is as the sun: when it shineth forth from its horizon it illumineth the regions and brighteth the faces of those who have attained. Whoso is deprived thereof is indeed in manifest loss.” We say: “O Messenger! Canst thou enter the cities and regions, and wilt thou find therein for thyself any helper?” It saith: “I have no knowledge save what Thou, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hast taught me.” We have sent down this Tablet as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest remind the people of that which it containeth from the presence of a mighty Commander. The glory be upon thee and upon whoso reciteth the verses of the All-Merciful with joy and radiance and is of them that are firmly established.</p>

Verily the Ocean hath appeared in human form and proclaimeth “The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.” Lo, the Tree crieth out “He Who is the Lord of Destiny hath appeared,” yet most of the people hear not. The Pen exclaimeth with loudest voice “The Lord of Eternity and Creator of Nations hath come,” yet most of the people perceive not. Those who sleep this day are accounted as dead - to this beareth witness the Lord of the invisible and visible realms. And they who have heard the Call - these are of the people of Baha, preserved in a guarded Tablet. Blessed is he who hath heard and remained steadfast, and woe betide him who hath followed every rejected idolator. Say: O people, follow not your selfish desires. Follow rather what ye are commanded in the Tablet - this is better for you, did ye but know. Commit not what is forbidden you in the Book, and abandon not what ye are commanded in the revealed Tablet. Say: Be not like those who call upon the All-Merciful with their tongues while following Satan in their deeds - these are indeed the losers. We have commanded none save what is better for him than all that existeth in the invisible and visible realms. Hold fast to the Most Great Cord - verily it hath appeared with truth through a manifest sovereignty. It is God’s trust among you and His sovereignty within you, would that ye might understand. O servant! Be not disturbed by those who are moved by the winds of self and passion. Cling to the hem of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.

Cast aside names and take what ye are bidden by God, the Cleaver of the daybreak. This is a Day wherein the assemblage of the divines hath been scattered and the hearts of the theologians have been troubled, and the Herald hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Creator of all existence. Beware lest the doubts of the world hold thee back. Cast vain imaginings beneath thy feet, clinging to the hem of the robe of thy Lord’s mercy, the Revealer of verses. The carpet of vain imaginings hath been rolled up, for God hath come riding upon the clouds. Can anyone deny what hath appeared in truth, and can anyone object to the Mother Book? Say: O people of the Bayan! Look ye, then remember when the Desired One came on the Day of Resurrection. The divines of Persia turned away from Him and opposed Him until they slew Him with tyranny whereat the heavens wept. They followed their own desires and denied Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Thus hath the Pen spoken when the Lord of all names was walking in the most exalted station.

<p>This is a Book which testifies before the world to that which the Lord of Nations testified before the creation of earth and heaven - that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have heard thy call time and again, and have answered thee as a favor from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The ocean of utterance surged when stirred by the fragrance of thy love. Thus was the matter decreed, that thou mightest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Goal of all return. He who was named Muhammad came before the Wronged One in the Most Great Prison with thy letter, from which We found the fragrance of thy sincerity to God, the Lord of Lords. We sent with him that from which the sincere ones will perceive the fragrances of the garment from this Spot which God, the Lord of all directions, hath made. Then the servant who is present came with thy other letter and presented it before the Wronged One, and this Tablet was revealed for thee which speaketh the truth throughout ages and centuries. Blessed art thou for having turned to My horizon, heard My call, spoken My praise, and arisen to serve My Cause whereby the mountains were shaken. We have accepted what thou didst in the prison. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou assured of God’s grace and mercy, then strive that there may appear from thee that which shall endure throughout the eternity of My most beautiful Names. Thy Lord verily aideth whom He willeth through a command from Him, and He is the Powerful over what will be and what hath been. The Glory shining from the horizon of grace be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto what they were promised in the Books, the Psalms and the Tablets.</p>

<p>He is! Divine words which have descended from the Source of glorified utterance in a wondrous Arabic accent have been heard and listened to beyond measure and count. Now hear them in eloquent Persian, that perchance thou mayest pass from this transient abode to the immortal Kingdom, and in these dark days when the dust of trials hath encompassed all contingent beings and their peoples, thou mayest not remain far from the pathway of the flowing stream which is the station of recognition of the Beauty of the All-Merciful. O servant! The world hath never had, nor hath, any permanence. Soon thou shalt find all who are visible therein and all that exists therein to be non-existent, such that thou shalt see no trace of all that is on earth. Therefore, sanctify thyself from all that exists before the people, that perchance thou mayest recognize the First Beauty in the Last Garment. For today all people remain veiled and concealed behind imaginary veils. Take refuge in the One God, that perchance thou mayest be saved from these depths of fancy wherein all are drowned, and arrive at and find rest at the fountainhead of life. This is the grace of thy Lord Who hath mentioned thee through His holy words. Therefore, purify thy heart from worldly grief, for grief is rejected save in trials of this divine Youth Who dwelleth in the well of envy and hatred. In any case, mighty effort is needed lest thou remain deprived of the wondrous outpourings of these days. Thus doth thy Lord counsel thee, that thou mayest be among them that hear.</p>

<p>He is the One speaking from His most exalted horizon. The Word of God hath appeared in truth. Verily it aideth the Cause of its Lord, the Master of the Day of Separation. Verily it announceth unto all on earth the heaven of grace and ocean of bounty and sun of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of Lords. Blessed is the servant who hath heard and responded to the call of God, and woe unto every denying infidel. He who loved Me hath appeared before the Wronged One. We make mention of thee in a Tablet whereunto nothing possessed by the nations can compare, as doth testify He with Whom is the Mother Book. Can anyone prevent the power of My Most Exalted Pen or the influence of My Most Great Word? Nay, by My true Self! Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto every hesitating doubter. When thou hast attained unto My Tablet and heard My call, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made known unto me the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Ocean of Thy knowledge and the Repository of Thine inspiration. I beseech Thee by the sighing of the lovers in Thy days and the crying out of those yearning for Thee in their love for Thee, and by the Word before which the necks of Thy creation have bowed down, to make me one of those who have quaffed the choice wine of Thy revelation and taken hold of Thy Book through Thy power, in such wise that neither the weapons of the world nor the hosts of the nations deterred them. O my Lord! Ordain for this servant that which befitteth Thy bounty and grace. Then make me one of those who have heard Thy most sweet call and attained unto Thy mention and praise amidst humanity. O my Lord! Thy mercy hath preceded all and Thy grace hath encompassed all. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained for those of Thy servants who are nigh unto Thee and those of Thy creatures who are sincere. Thou art the Almighty One by the movement of Whose finger the heaven was cleft asunder and the earth was split and the mountains were crushed. There is no God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

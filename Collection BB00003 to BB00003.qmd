Say: All are prostrate before Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Chrysolite, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Say: God originateth all things and then causeth them to return, and unto Him shall all return. He it is Who createth all things by His command, and unto Him shall all be turned. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command, from the past and unto the future.

There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.He it is Who determineth the measures of all things in the Book. There is no God but He. Say: All are prostrate before Him. All who are in the heavens and on the earth glorify Him. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Well-Beloved. All who are in the kingdom of command and creation and what lieth between them prostrate before Him. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation and the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: He is independent of all who are in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them, and all stand ready at His command.

His is the might and power from the past and unto the future, and all are devoted to Him. And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and there is no God but God. Say: All are prostrate before Him. He it is Who sendeth the winds as glad-tidings before His mercy \[...\]

And there is no God but God. Say: All are prostrate before Him. He it is Who sends forth the winds as glad tidings before His mercy, and Who sends down from heaven the water of life wherewith ye till the earth. And He it is Who has made subject unto His command the sun and the moon and the stars. Is not His the creation and the command? There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He is the One Who stands supreme above His creation. To Him belongs whatsoever is in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lies between them. There is no God but He, the Great, the Most Exalted. Say: Through God do all stand firm. Glorified and exalted is He above what they mention. Glory be to God, the Lord of dominion and sovereignty!

Say: All believe in God and His signs. Say: All stand firm through God and His signs. Say: All bow down before God and His signs. Say: All are devoted to God and His signs. Say: All remember God and His signs. Say: If ye truly believe in God and His signs, then ye are believers; otherwise ye are, in the estimation of God and those endowed with knowledge, truly among the unbelievers. He is the Truth. There is no God but He. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. They who have believed in God and His signs are in their own eyes truly among the believers. And God is independent of them and of their faith and of all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lies between them, and all are His worshippers. They who have barred themselves from their Lord's command - these shall abide forever in the fire. Say: He is the Truth. There is no God but He. He creates what He willeth through His command 'Be,' and it is. Say: He is the All-Compelling, high above you.

All are His worshippers. Verily, those who are veiled from their Lord's Cause are they who shall abide eternally in the fire. Say: He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He creates what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. Say: He is the All-Compelling above you, the Manifest over you, the Exalted at your right hand, and the Most High above your heads, exercising authority over you from every direction, that He may transform you in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, however He willeth by His command.

This is your station with God, and that wherein you take pride is that which God hath ordained in you through His command. Were God to withdraw aught from a thing, then would ye witness the second within the second.In the Name of God, the Most Righteous, the Most Righteous!Glory be unto Thee, O God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the dominion and the realm of humanity.

To Thee be glory and beauty, and Thee be radiance and splendor, and Thee be countenance and perfection, and Thee be likeness and similitude, and Thee be station and majesty, and Thee be grandeur and glory, and Thee be exaltation and sovereignty, and Thee be dominion and independence, and Thee be might and invincibility, and Thee be power and ascendancy, and Thee be joy and gladness. And Thee be whatsoever Thou lovest or conceivest in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been one God, eternal, single, living, self-subsisting, everlasting, independent, transcendent, invincible. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things according to Thy measure and hast formed all things according to Thy Will. There is no guide save Thee and no leader beside Thee. Whomsoever Thou guidest shall never go astray, and whomsoever Thou leadest shall never be veiled from Thy good-pleasure. Glorified art Thou! Thou art exalted above all creation which is in Thy grasp. Thou art raised in Thy loftiness above all possibilities, and hast manifested Thy majesty above all contingent beings, and art magnified in Thy might above all creation, and hast asserted Thy sovereignty over all atoms, and hast demonstrated Thy domination over all who dwell in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and hast shown forth Thy power above all symbols and allusions. Glorified art Thou! How great, how exalted, how mighty, how majestic, how lofty, how invincible, how dominating, how powerful art Thou! Thou hast brought the creation of all things into being from nothing through Thy power, then manifested Thyself to all things through all things by Thy grandeur. Whosoever seeketh manifestation through Thy glory, this is from the might of his own self, whereby he hath attributed mere evanescence to absolute permanence and utter poverty to complete independence. Otherwise, Thou hast ever been exalted above what Thou hast created and wilt create, and sanctified above what Thou hast fashioned and wilt fashion in the kingdom of Thy heaven and earth. And all, in their relation to Thee, assert relationship to exalt their own selves and existence. Glorified art Thou! Thou hast cut off relationship from all possessing relationship and hast confined all relationship to the Manifestations of Thyself and hast severed all relationship from all peoples save those who follow Thee in true obedience in the Bayan and worship Thee in true worship in the Exposition until the Day when Thou willest to transform love and show forth the signs of Thy power to those in the kingdom of earth and heaven. Glorified and exalted art Thou! All shall worship Thee according to the truth of the sovereignty of Thy oneness, and all shall prostrate themselves before Thee according to the truth of the might of Thy singleness, and all shall unite in Thee through the manifestations of the glory of Thy divinity, and all shall magnify Thee through the revelations of the holiness of Thy eternity, and all shall glorify Thee through the modes of the glory of Thy singleness. Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection through what Thou art in all Thy names and their examples by Thy Command. Verily Thou hast encompassed all things in knowledge and Thou art powerful over all things. The third in the third. In the Name of God, the Most Guiding, the Most Guiding. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings \[...\]

Praise be to God, Who hath exalted Himself in His transcendence above all contingent things, Who hath manifested His sovereignty above all created things, Who hath demonstrated His dominion above all things that have being, Who hath shown His might above all atoms, and Who hath revealed His grandeur above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He is the One beside Whom there is no equal, the Most Exalted above all likeness and duration, and the Most Holy, sanctified beyond every attribute and number. He hath created what He willeth by His command and ordained what He desireth by His sovereignty. Every created thing beareth witness that there is none other God but Him - a testimony purified from the ways of associating partners with God and from all veils, sanctified from the paths of remoteness and separation. This testimony pointeth to the sovereignty of His oneness and rendereth all else as mere words before the King of His single sovereignty, giving utterance to that which He is in the might of His supreme oneness and upon the throne of His singular dominion. This testimony is magnetic, beauteous, magnificent, luminous, merciful, mighty, glorious, content, learned, powerful, steadfast, noble, sovereign, dominant, transcendent, impregnable, generous, detached, gracious, bountiful, near, remote, clement and supreme. Its beginning testifieth to the primacy of its Creator, its end to the finality of its Fashioner, its outward aspect to the manifestness of its Originator, and its inward reality to the hiddenness of its Revealer. This testimony filleth the pillars of all things with the truth of His knowledge, and every thing testifieth to that which proveth through its own essence and for its own sake that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling. He hath chosen a Mirror for His manifestation and deposited within it His signs by His power, filling thereby His heaven and His earth with the truth that there is none other God but Him, and that this is the Source of all names and attributes, the Revealer of all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Through Him alone is God known, not through any other. Through Him alone is God worshipped, not through any other. Through Him alone is God described, not through aught else. Then He created by His Word whatsoever He wished of the paths of His glorious Lordship and the measures of His holy eternity, that all contingent things might testify that there is none other God but Him, the One in Essence, like unto Whom there is nothing, and He is the Most Great, the Most Exalted. Then the first thing He created was One at the summit of attributes, sanctified from all similitudes and likenesses. Through Him God hath made Himself known on the Day of Resurrection to everything upon which the name of a thing hath been conferred, of all that hath been or will be brought into being through creation. Whoso knoweth Him thus is a believer in God, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and whoso denieth this, God loveth not to make mention of him, and this one is destined for the fire until such time as God may wish to create him anew and cause him to enter the paradise of the knowledge of His Self, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling.The Fourth in the FourthIn the Name of God, the Most Righteous, the Most RighteousPraise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Righteous, the Most Righteous. And verily the glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen except the First Unity.

And whosoever resembles that One, wherein naught is seen but the First One. And after a time, bear thou witness that there is no guide save God, the Glorified, and no object of desire besides Him, and no guide other than Him. If thou seekest guidance through the guidance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, then verily He, exalted be His glory, is thy guide, and this thou canst not attain through any means until the Day of Resurrection. And thereafter, if thou seekest guidance through God's guides who desire naught but God - not those who attribute themselves to God that they might attain their selfish desires - then thou hast sought guidance through the guidance of God's Cause for God's guidance. For that which liveth in those guides is the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest, not their own selves. Then thy end shall be praiseworthy in that it leadeth to God's good-pleasure. Otherwise, follow thou no one, for whoso followeth anyone hath as though worshipped him. Worship none but God alone, alone. The witnesses of the Bayan, when they call unto God but thou followest them to their own selves - they, insofar as they are themselves, God hath not commanded thee to follow them. This holdeth true until the Day of Resurrection when the Lord of the Cause shall shine forth. Then follow thou none except Him, and seek not guidance from any guide besides Him, and follow not the ways of those who mislead people in the name of guidance. For these are like those who guide people in the outward aspects of their religion - both are forbidden by God, since neither these nor those will have been guided by God's guidance on the Day of Resurrection, nor will they have openly worshipped God. Therefore, cut thyself off from both and hold fast unto God, then unto His verses, then unto him who calleth thee to the path of truth made certain. For anything less than this is not of God's guidance, and this is of God's guidance which thy Lord hath ordained. Hold fast then to the Most Great Handle which until the Day of Resurrection shall remain lofty and inaccessible, and through the truth manifest and triumphant, that perchance thou mayest thereby be guided on the Day of Resurrection unto Him Who created thee and sustained thee and causeth thee to die and giveth thee life, through the right path. On that Day shall guidance be sought through the guidance of God, exalted be His glory, and direction be sought through the direction of God, exalted be His majesty. For anything less than this is not of that which thou wert commanded in the Bayan. However, these who have become known by the name of guidance are better in God's sight than those who have become known by the name of religious jurisprudence, since these latter ones on the Day of Resurrection did not judge concerning God their Lord while the former did judge. Therefore these are, in God's sight, above those others - better than them in degrees and their veils. Otherwise, in that paradise neither these nor those shall have any portion. None entereth therein save he who hath four stations. The first in the first, and verily he shall be of the believers. In the Name of God, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. There is no God but He, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. Say: God is more watchful than any possessed of watchfulness. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of the Sovereign of watchfulness. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been watchful, watching, and vigilant. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are submissive before Him. And praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are humble before Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the divine realm, then the strength and the crystal essence, then the dominion and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. He, verily, hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and unto Him shall all be raised. Say: God causeth all things to die, and unto Him shall all be transformed. Say: God giveth life to all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: He is the One Who subdueth His creation, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: He is the One manifest above His servants, and He is the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. And He is the One Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and unto Him shall all return. There is no doubt in God, the Originator of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Well-Beloved. Say: Glorified be God, there is no doubt in this and all are certain of it. Say: He aideth whom He willeth through His command. He, verily, is the Strong, the Mighty, the All-Loving. He it is Who determineth the measures of all things in the Book. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye be knowing? Say: God is the Creator of all things and we all believe in that whereunto He calleth us. Say: Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye bear witness? Say: In the hand of God Who originated all things, and unto Him are all humble. Say: He is the Subduer above His creation, and the Manifest above His servants, and the Exalted above the right hand of all things, and the Inaccessible beyond the left hand of all things, and the Most High above the height of all things, and the Dominant over all things, and the Guardian over what proceedeth from Him. He holdeth the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. His is the creation \[...\]

And whatsoever is between them is by His command. His is the creation and the authority. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: Through God do ye shine forth, and through God do ye attain grandeur, and through God do ye acquire beauty, and through God do ye achieve greatness, and through God do ye become illumined, and through God do ye receive mercy, and through God do ye gain elevation, and through God do ye obtain power, and through God do ye find contentment, and through God do ye exercise authority, and through God do ye acquire nobility, and through God do ye gain dominion, and through God do ye achieve transcendence. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. Say: All are subservient unto Him. Say: All that hath been and shall be created is for Him Whom God shall make manifest, then ye shall possess it by God's leave. And whoso possesseth even a grain of mustard seed after His manifestation, verily the breath of their own souls hath not become lawful unto them, how much less that which their hands possess. O all things! From that Day be ye God-fearing. Verily it is a Day of truth wherein ye shall all attain every grace if ye believe in God and then in Him upon Whom God shall send down His verses, that ye may be assured. That is the Day wherein all the works your hands have wrought shall come to naught if ye turn away from Him Whom God shall make manifest and follow not that which He commandeth you from God. Follow no one besides Him, lest ye follow other than God while ye perceive not. Love no one besides Him, lest ye love other than God while ye know not. Look not upon anyone except by God's leave from His presence, for this is the balance of justice from God for the Day wherein ye shall be brought before God, your Lord. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Sovereign, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God possesseth transcendent might. Unto God belongeth the good-pleasure of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them; He is well-pleased with whomsoever He willeth among His servants, for He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

This is the Path of God, from before and from after, if ye wish to follow it. Otherwise, it is all the same to God, from before and from after, in every condition, and unto Him do all worship. And all, in all conditions, belong to God and unto Him do all prostrate themselves.Say: He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. And we have no God but God. His is the grandeur and the majesty in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.Then the second in the second. In the Name of God, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the grandeur, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and the ruby-like splendor, the sovereignty and the human realm, then the glory and the majesty, then the countenance and the beauty, then the face and the perfection, then the strength and the activity, then the mercy and the bounty, then the likeness and the similitudes, then the stations and the sublimity, then the greatness and the independence, then the awesomeness and the manifestation, then the might and the invincibility, then the power and the exaltation, then the joy and the gladness, then the sovereignty and the omnipotence, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation, and in the realm of Thy heaven and earth. Every thing, within the bounds of its existence and the limits of its possibility, beareth witness that it hath no master besides Thee and no sovereign other than Thee. Glorified art Thou!

Glorified art Thou, and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Self-Subsisting, Unique, Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining, a Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any associate in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast ordered by Thy wisdom what is in the kingdom of Thy heaven and Thy earth, and hast brought all things into being from nothingness by Thy Will. Thou art manifest above all things, triumphant over all things, exalted in the heights above all things, and elevated above all that Thou hast created and fashioned. The dwellers of Thy earth and heaven and all that lies between them in the kingdom of Thy Command and Creation shall surely prostrate before Thee. Thou art He before Whom all existing things shall surely sanctify themselves with all that is within and upon them, and all created things shall surely affirm Thy unity with all that is within and upon them, and all atoms shall surely glorify Thee with all that is within and upon them, and all essences shall surely magnify Thee with all that is within and upon them, and all humanity shall surely extol Thee with all that is within and upon them, and all things shall surely prostrate before Thee in their beginning and their end, their outward and their inward aspects.Glorified art Thou, and exalted art Thou! Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy Command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Therefore, O my God, shower Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection through Thy names and attributes. Verily, nothing in the heavens or on the earth or between them can escape Thy knowledge, and nothing can frustrate Thee in the kingdom of Command or Creation or what lieth beneath them. Verily, Thou art All-Knowing, All-Powerful.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath manifested Himself in His appearance above all existing things, and hath concealed Himself in His concealment above all created things, and hath triumphed in His victory above all atoms, and hath demonstrated His power above all who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes, and hath proved inaccessible through the inaccessibility of His eternity above all similitudes and allusions. He is the One God, Single, Unique, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Living, Peerless, Everlasting, the All-Glorious, the Most High. At this moment, I testify, and all His creation testifieth, to what He is in the sanctity of His attributes and the glory of His names, that He hath ever been the One God, transcendent above all praise and glorification, and the Lord, exalted and sanctified above all description and comparison. He hath originated all originated things through His Will, and hath created all created things through His Purpose, and hath brought all new things into being through His Power, and hath caused all things to exist through His Decree, and hath formed all forms by His leave, and hath made manifest what He hath willed in the kingdom of His heaven and earth according to what He hath detailed in the Book by His leave. Then He hath numbered all that He hath created \[...\]

Praise be unto Him Who hath contented His land with that which He hath glorified in the Book by His leave, and hath encompassed all that He hath created and originated through that which was revealed in His Book, whereby He desired to surround all His servants with that which hath issued forth from the treasury of His concealment and appeared from the dawning-places of His holiness. His knowledge hath ever encompassed all things before the existence of all things and after all things, before the limitations of all things. I testify that He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, from time immemorial and unto time immemorial, and the Almighty, the All-Wise in the sovereignty of sanctity and majesty. He hath chosen an impregnable essence, a subtle course, a radiant camphor, an exalted harmony, and a lofty being. Then He shone forth upon it, and through it He became inaccessible from it and independent through it from aught else. He made it the station of the manifestation of His Self and the concealment of His Essence, and revealed through it whatsoever He wished of the signs of His power and the manifestations of His sovereignty. He and all His creation testify that He hath indeed known all things Himself. He hath caused all creation to hear His verses and hath called all things unto His servants, their Creator, and hath willed that all things should enter into the good-pleasure of their Fashioner and that all things should know the path of their Lord therein. He hath filled the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him. And this is the first Temple that hath shone forth and radiated, and the first Pattern that hath been adorned and embellished, and the first Light that hath dawned and been uplifted, and the first Radiance that hath risen and flashed forth, and the first Harmony that hath been concealed. And I bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Glorious. He hath chosen for the Manifestation of His Self mighty proofs, each one in a mirror indicating that there is none other God but Him, and this is a Sun through which God hath manifested Himself unto us through our own selves, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Manifest, the Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Watchful, the Most Watchful. And verily all glory is from God.

Unto the First One and unto him who resembleth that One, wherein naught is seen save the First One. And furthermore, I testify that there is no guide save God and none can be guided except through His guidance. He knoweth the stations of hearts and spirits, then of souls and bodies, and whatsoever is beneath that are His manifestations in His dominion through paths He hath guided and dawning-places He hath caused to shine forth. They guide by His leave and direct by His command, and all are within the grasp of the Sovereign of His might and the dominion of His Self-Subsisting power. None hath any thing save by His command. His is the creation and the command, before and after. There is no God but He, and His are four degrees. The first in the first, He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Supporting, the Most Supporting. There is no God but He, the Most Supporting, the Most Supporting. Say: God is the Most Supporting, above all who possess support. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the Sovereign power of His support. Verily, He hath ever been the Support, the Supporter, the Sustainer.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are worshippers before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them.

From your faith and that which is forbidden to you from your attributes, and that which is exalted above you over your heads, and that which rules over you beneath your feet, and that which dominates you from every direction that reaches unto you, He will assuredly assist whomsoever He willeth through His command and will protect whomsoever He pleaseth through His leave.

Thus doth God recompense those who have martyred themselves in His path, and who are assured of God and His signs. Say: Whoso is martyred in the path of God, God will assuredly exalt him in the life to come and in this life, for He hath power over all things. Say: God hath ordained for those who are martyred in His path that He shall exalt their mention in this life and in the life to come, and shall cause them to enter the seats of light from His presence. There, by God's leave, do they glorify Him. Say: This indeed is the Most Great Name among all names in the Book, through which ye call upon God, your Lord. The first to aid God in the Bayan were the harbingers of that Name, and these are they who, in the sight of God, are among those who glorify Him. Say: For him who is martyred in the path of God, there remaineth naught that he should ask of God at that time, by virtue of God's grace upon those who were martyred in His path when others would follow after them.

God hath not created in Paradise any station more exalted than the stations of those who have been martyred in His path, for they have ascended unto God with all that they possessed from Him, and unto God, their Lord, do they return. They love for themselves what He loves, and when they sacrifice their lives it is in the path of God their Lord. Thus no rank remains in Paradise to which they do not attain by God's leave. Thus doth God bestow His favor upon His God-fearing servants. Say: They gaze from the highest horizon upon all things and laugh, saying: "Praise be to God Who hath made us inherit these realms wherein we shall abide forever. Therein we have whatsoever our souls desire, and God increaseth His bounty unto us, for we are among the thankful." Say: The mention of Light after Darkness is like the mention of Baha after Dal in the Qur'an, wherein ye at that time bore witness to your religion in Islam. Nothing could be greater than this twofold manifestation. This is the light of God whereby all of you are illumined. And ye shall witness in the Bayan what is greater and mightier than this, and ye pride yourselves, are exalted, elevated and magnified by the mention of those who are martyred in God's path, though ye reflect but little thereon. All this is but a leaf from the gardens of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Ye shall then submit and attain unto all good. If ye desire to be among the exponents of His Name, ye shall witness this among the exponents in God's path. And if ye desire to be among the exponents of God's light, ye shall witness this in God's path. And if ye desire to be among the exponents of God's might, ye shall overcome in His path. And if ye desire to be among the exponents of God's mercy, ye shall show mercy in His path. And if ye desire to be among the exponents of God's grandeur, ye shall manifest grandeur in His path. And whatsoever ye love of the most beautiful Names, to the number of all things, before the number of all things, and after the number of all things, ye are able to acquire these fruits from the gardens of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and upon every branch that ye love shall ye find repose. If ye desire to be of the glory of Truth, ye shall take from that Most Exalted Example, and if ye desire to be of the splendor of Truth, ye shall take from that Most Exalted Example whatsoever your souls desire of the most beautiful attributes \[...\]

And if you desire to be of the Beauty of Truth, you shall take from that Most Exalted Exemplar whatsoever your souls desire of sublime attributes and lofty examples from Him Whom God shall manifest. From Him shall you derive illumination and in Him shall you remain steadfast. And for whomsoever bears witness in the path of God, it is ordained before his martyrdom that he shall take vengeance on those who were proud against him. This has been decreed before all things, after all things, above all things, beneath all things, and with all things. That which hath been sent down in the Book from His presence cannot be altered, and that which hath been ordained from the presence of God by His command cannot be changed. Verily, He is the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful, the Most Great. Thus shall God take vengeance by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Witness, the Most Witness.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and the sovereignty, then the earthly realm and dominion, then the glory and the majesty, then the countenance and the beauty, then the face and the perfection, then the grandeur and the independence, then the inaccessibility and the sublimity, then the mercy and the grace, then the authority and the justice, then the might and the action, then the glory and the invincibility, then the power and the exaltation, then the joy and the gladness, then the sovereignty and the omnipotence.Then unto Thee belongeth whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been, O my God, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and supreme over whatsoever Thou desirest, and dominant over all things, and manifest above all things, and sovereign over all things. Thy dominion is exalted above all contingent beings, Thy manifestation is evident throughout all existence, Thy compulsion encompasses all created things, and Thy power prevails over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thy invincibility transcends all similitudes and allusions.Thou hast ever been one God, Self-Subsisting, Single, Ever-Living, Self-Existing, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Independent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted, Joyous, Majestic, Beautiful, Great, Luminous, Mighty, Glorified, Powerful, Compelling, Well-Pleased, Stern, Sovereign, All-Possessing, Merciful, Magnificent, All-Encompassing, forever and ever. Thou hast never taken unto Thyself any partner, companion or son, nor hath there been any associate in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned.Thou hast ever been the Subduer of the mighty, the Manifestation of manifestations, the Sovereign of sovereigns, the Vanquisher of vanquishers, and the Possessor of power. Thou hast assured whosoever ascendeth unto Thee with all that Thou possesseth of Thy grace, Thy generosity, Thy bounty, Thy favor and Thy gift. Therefore, O my God, cause the dwellers of the kingdom of Thy power to enter that sea, for I know of no sea in the kingdom of Thy names more exalted than this.

O Lord! Cause the dwellers of the kingdom of Thy power to enter into that Sea, for I know not in the kingdom of Thy names any sea more exalted, greater, more glorious, more impregnable, more mighty, or more sovereign than this. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for all Thy decrees, and glory be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for all Thy favors in their essence. Thou hast chosen as guides for entry into that transcendent and surging Sea those who praise Thee, glorify Thee, proclaim Thy unity, magnify Thee and extol Thy greatness. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for what Thou hast decreed and ordained.O Lord! Cause all whom Thou willest among Thy chosen ones to enter into that most exalted, vast, tumultuous and mighty Sea. All these seas are but parts thereof - some dwell in the sea of that Name. How great is their station, O my God, and how lofty their rank, O my Beloved! O Lord! Shower upon them Thy blessings through Thy glory, majesty, grandeur, light, mercy, words, names, might, favors, knowledge, power, utterance, gifts, honor, sovereignty, dominion, transcendence, and through all that pertaineth unto Thee of Thy most beautiful names and most exalted attributes. For I know not in Thy knowledge any dwellers of the sea nearer than these or mightier in rank.O Lord! Free Thy servants that they may dwell in all the seas of Thy names and attributes. O Lord! Manifest the dwellers of the sea of Thy omnipotence, dominion, might, power, sovereignty, invincibility, authority, triumph, bounty and grandeur. Thou hast clothed them in the garments of might and dominion, and arrayed them in the robes of sovereignty and manifestation. In every revelation and in every paradise Thou createst therein all manner of fruits, each of which sufficeth its people apart from others.O Lord! Bestow upon me all the fruits of Thy good-pleasure. O Lord! Suffice me through Thy sufficiency. O Lord! Guard me through Thy guardianship. Protect me through Thy protection. Preserve me, O Lord, through Thy preservation and shelter. Safeguard me, O Lord, through Thy safeguarding and sovereignty. For Thou art the All-Subduing, the All-Powerful, the All-Sufficient, the Manifest, the Impregnable, the Most Exalted.The first fruits I tasted from the paradise of the Bayan were the fruits of that Name, O my God, and grief from Thee hath filled me. Therefore, O Lord, cause me to taste of all Thy names as they are in themselves. Fill me, O Lord, with the manifestations of Thy strength, power, greatness, might, subsistence and sovereignty. May that grief be transformed into Thy joy, and that weeping be changed through Thy grace. Verily Thou hast encompassed all things with Thy knowledge, and Thou art powerful over all things.O Lord! Raise up the manifestations of Thy might, power, strength, invincibility, sovereignty, dominion, loftiness, exaltation, greatness, subsistence and triumph, that they may cause all who are on earth to enter into Thy love and good-pleasure, and that they may cause all in Thy creation who deserve it to taste of all Thy bounty and favors, and all who merit Thy pardon \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God, Who hath prevailed through the sovereignty of His supreme dominion over all created things, Who hath manifested His transcendent power over all existence, Who hath demonstrated His sovereign might over all beings, Who hath exercised His dominion over all atoms through His supreme authority, Who hath triumphed through His overwhelming power over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, Who hath displayed His invincible strength above all who inhabit the realms of earth and heaven, and Who hath shown forth His compelling majesty over all symbols and evidences.He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Witnessing. He further testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling. Again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Subduing. Yet again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Conquering. And again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Helping. Moreover He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Opening. Furthermore He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Almighty. Again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Bountiful. He further testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Powerful. Again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. Yet again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Judging. And again He testifieth, and all His creation testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Perfect.He further testifieth, exalted be His remembrance, that He hath created the Paradise of the Bayan for the Manifestation of His Self, and hath caused to grow therein the trees of His most excellent names and His most exalted attributes, that all may partake of whatsoever they desire through the bounty of their Lord. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the One, the Sovereign. And may His blessings rest upon Him Who hath manifested that Paradise, and upon the martyrs in His presence who have detached themselves from all mention of their own selves for the exaltation of the Cause of their Glorified Lord. These are they upon whom are bestowed the blessings and mercy of God, their Lord, and these are they who have attained their goal.In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. And verily all glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity. And furthermore, O thou Name! Thou hast indeed fulfilled thy covenant on the Day of Resurrection, and God hath caused thee, by reason of thy faithfulness to thy covenant, to transcend all names. Verily, He is witness over all things. Moreover, I testify that the Bayan is God's Paradise; whosoever desireth to draw nigh unto God, his Lord, through lofty proofs, God hath opened the way unto him. If thou desirest to be among the exponents of glory, then be thou therein \[...\]

May God reward you for your faithfulness to your covenant above all names, for verily He is witness over all things. Then bear witness that the Bayan is God's paradise wherein whosoever wishes to be guided to God his Lord through sublime proofs, God has opened the way for him. If you wish to be among those who guide to glory, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to exaltation, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to knowledge, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to wealth, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to martyrdom, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to dominion, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to might, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to sovereignty, be of them; if you wish to be among those who guide to agriculture, be of them. For you shall see in all these guidances but one Guide, as in all these mirrors there is but one Sun by which all are moved. But you must be among those who guide to Glory that you may believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted and sublime be His power and elevated be His remembrance. Be not among those guides, nor be a mere abstract essence seeking none but God and desiring naught besides Him. Let your guide be Him Whom God shall make manifest and none else, and your leader be Him Whom God shall make manifest and none other. For without this you will be veiled from beholding the lights and from witnessing His mysterious countenance before the King, the Supreme, the All-Luminous, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the All-Revealing. There is no God but God, the One, the All-Compelling. And He has four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Gladdening, the Most Gladdening. There is no God but He, the Most Gladdening, the Most Gladdening. Say: God is the Most Gladdening above all bearers of glad-tidings. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of the Sovereign of glad-tidings. Verily He has ever been the Bearer of Glad-tidings, the Gladdening, the All-Bountiful. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lies between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. Praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God testifies that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Glory, then the Sovereignty and the Realm of Creation. He causes to live and to die, then causes to die and to live, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily He has power over all things. And blessed be He Who is the God of the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.

Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God verily giveth you glad tidings of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Will ye not, then, rejoice?

Make yourselves announcing angels that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may be mentioned before God with glad tidings of truth.

O ye who are possessed of the Bayan! Let your souls be even as angels spreading glad-tidings, that ye may be remembered with true remembrance before God on the Day of Resurrection through your joyous announcements.

Let not the sovereignty of what hath been and shall be created divert you from God's sovereignty, if ye be among them that believe in God and His signs. Should all that is on earth divert you from Him, and ye find yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest, then ye shall not be counted among the believers before God. But should your faith in God remain steadfast, and naught veil you from Him, then ye shall be numbered on the Day of Resurrection among the believers. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He accepteth naught from anyone save the truth from Him. Thus hath the Bayan been sent down in truth, that ye may be assured of the pure truth on the Day of Resurrection. Unto God belongeth all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. All shall rejoice at the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all shall render thanks at His manifestation.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Joyous, the Most Joyous!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm, then the Glory and the Majesty, then the Countenance and the Beauty, then the Face and the Perfection, then the Strength and the Action, then the Face and the Grace, then the Authority and the Justice, then the Likeness and the Examples, then the Stations and the Grandeur, then the Greatness and the Independence, then the Awe and the Revelation, then the Might and the Inaccessibility, then the Power and the Exaltation, then the Joy and the Gladness, then the Sovereignty and the Power, then the glad-tidings of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been alone in the dominion of might and majesty, and exalted in the realm of holiness and beauty. Thou hast given glad-tidings unto all Thy creation through Thy knowledge and the knowledge of the guides to Thy Self. Thine is the praise of gratitude, O my God, for these great glad-tidings and supreme joy. Thou hast ever given glad-tidings unto Thy servants of Thy good-pleasure and forgiveness, when Thou didst say - and Thy word is the truth - through the words of Thy beloved aforetime: "O My servants who have transgressed against their own souls! Despair not of the mercy of God, for verily God forgiveth all sins. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful." Then Thou didst say: "O all things! Seek ye forgiveness from Me, for I shall forgive all in the Bayan whatsoever I love not for them until the day of My manifestation, should they believe in and be assured of the Manifestation of My Self. Verily I have ever been the Forgiver, the Bountiful, and verily I have ever been the Concealer, the Merciful." Glory be unto Thee! How exalted are Thy glad-tidings in the Bayan, and how lofty Thy joy in the Bayan! By Thy might! My heart findeth no rest save through faith in Thee and in that which Thou hast ordained in the paths of Thy might.

Raise thou thy rapture in the Bayan. By Thy glory, my heart findeth no rest save through faith in Thee and in whatsoever Thou hast ordained in the paths of Thy might and the dawning-places of Thy will. My heart shall find no peace until Thou dost raise up powerful sovereigns and impregnable kings who shall cause all upon earth to bow down in the Bayan before Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. Should my knowledge encompass that there remaineth anyone in any region of the earth who hath not prostrated before Him at the time of His manifestation, my heart would not be content. Therefore, O my God, give me glad-tidings, for by Thy glory, I shall show more mercy to all things than they show unto themselves, by delivering them from the fire of their veils and causing them to enter the paradise of Thy forgiveness. Strengthen me, O my God, in this and cause all Thy glad-tidings to grieve for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, that Thou mayest cause all His enemies to hear that whosoever believeth not in Him is lower than the lowest, and whosoever believeth in Him is higher than the highest. Show this manifest before Him as Thou willest and as Thou pleasest, for Thine is the sovereignty and the power, Thine the greatness and the transcendence, Thine the grandeur and the invincibility, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the dominion and the all-compelling force. Bless Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with every joy and splendor, with every gladness and glory. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and invincible in whatsoever Thou desirest. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Pervading, Holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast ever been the Subduer of the mighty, the Manifest among the manifest ones, the Powerful among the powerful, the Exalted among the exalted ones, and the Helper of helpers. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who perisheth not, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Joyous, the Most Joyous. Praise be to God Who hath exalted through the exaltation of His sovereignty the sovereignty of His Self-Subsistence above all contingent beings, and hath prevailed through the triumph of the King of His mighty dominion above all existing things, and hath manifested through the manifestation of the King of His mighty dominion above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath transcended through the transcendence of the King of His Self-Subsistence above all created things, and hath become inaccessible through the inaccessibility of His oneness above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but Him, the One Who hath ever been and ever shall be, the Sanctified in the sovereignty of holiness and beauty, the Exalted in the kingdom of might\[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God Who manifests Himself in the realm of might and majesty, Who is inaccessible in the sovereignty of power and perfection, and Who is exalted in the heights of glory and transcendence. All creation bears witness that there is none other God but Him. He is the All-Compelling through His power, the All-Manifest through His might, the All-Luminous through His grandeur, the All-Subduing through His strength, the Ever-Helping through His sovereignty, the Creator through His glory, and the All-Forgiving through His mercy.He created what He willed without will and brought forth what He desired without desire. Through His power He created Will from nothing, and through His Will He brought forth Desire from naught. Then He raised up whatsoever He pleased by His command in the kingdoms of His might and holiness, and in the realms of His detachment and grace. He made the repositories of His knowledge, the vessels of His secrets, the keys of His mercy, the measures of His grandeur, and the lamps of His guidance to be exalted essences, lofty manifestations, radiant realities, resplendent beings, and eternal, self-subsisting entities.Then He revealed Himself unto them through them and deposited within them the example of their power. Thus their influences became manifest and He filled therewith His heavens and His earth. He bears witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling. Verily, the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His proof, directing all to none but God, the One, the All-Manifest. God chose for Him primary names and immersed them in the limitless ocean. Thus, countless are the harbingers of His glad-tidings, the envoys of His sovereign kingdom, the witnesses of His Faith, the measures of His wisdom, and the wellsprings of His authority.He has given glad-tidings of His love to all creation, and this is the highest summit created in His knowledge, whereunto they who ascend to that horizon. The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! The splendor from God be upon the First One and upon whoever resembles that One, wherein naught is seen but the First One.I bear witness that there is no glad-tiding save the knowledge of God, His love, His good-pleasure and His affection, and there is no way for thee nor for anyone to attain unto that knowledge except through the knowledge of Him Whom God shall make manifest, His affection, His good-pleasure and His love. If thou comprehendest this, then prostrate thyself as long as thou art able, for all on earth prostrate before Him, turning to none but Him and following none other than Him. When night approaches, follow the path that hath been ordained, for this is the good-pleasure of God. Ask not of the 'why' and 'wherefore', for He is wise in the kingdom of His Command and creation, and seeing in the realm of His might and holiness. He beholds the kingdom and decrees what benefits the cause of His servants. He shall not be questioned about what He doeth, but all things shall be questioned. For verily He is the Manifestation of the deed of God, exalted be His glory. All exist by His command, both before and after, and in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them.He hath four stations. The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning! There is no God but He, the Most Warning, the Most Warning! Say: God warns above every warner. None in the heavens \[...\]

He hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning! There is no God but He, the Most Warning, the Most Warning! Say: God is the Warner above every warner. None can escape from the dominion of His warning, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Warning, the All-Cautioning, the All-Forewarning.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed be He Who possesseth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God verily warneth you against failing to know Him. Will ye not then fear? Say: God verily warneth you against failing to please Him. Will ye not then fear? Say: God verily warneth you against a single letter from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Will ye not then fear? Say: God verily warneth you against veiling yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Will ye not then fear?Say: God hath indeed revealed aforetime and will reveal hereafter: "Verily there is no God but I, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Whosoever worshippeth Me from the beginning of his life until the moment he heareth mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and upon hearing faileth to say 'Yea, I believe in God, the Lord of the worlds' - I shall cast him into the fire, and none of his deeds shall be accepted. Thus do We destroy those who veil themselves. And whosoever worshippeth Me not from the beginning of his life until the moment he heareth mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and upon hearing declareth 'Yea, I believe in God, the Lord of the worlds' - I shall command the angels to record good deeds in his book, and I shall transform all his fire into light from My presence. Thus do We recompense the God-fearing."This is glad tidings for the righteous and this is warning for those who veil themselves. Thus doth God cause you to fear. Will ye not then be God-fearing? Say: If ye believe in God, ye should fear God, your Lord. Will ye not then reflect? After your death, as long as the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them endure, ye shall suffer torment in the fire. Therefore show mercy unto yourselves by believing in Him Whom God shall make manifest during your lives, that ye may dwell after your death in the Ridvan for as long as the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them endure.Say: On the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, God will transform the creation of all things \[...\]

And whatsoever lieth between them shall verily dwell in Paradise. Say: On the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, God shall transform the creation of all things, and all shall abide on that Day in the stations which God hath ordained for them. Nay, those that dwell in Paradise shall abide therein until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then, when they respond to God and to that which is revealed from His presence, they shall enter Paradise. Otherwise, God shall banish them from Paradise by reason of their rejection of the love of Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Cause, and they shall enter into the fire wherein they shall abide until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. On that Day, whoso believeth in Him Whom God shall make manifest, God shall deliver him from the fire and cause him to enter Paradise. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.Will ye not reflect upon those who preceded you, such as Shaddad who ruled over the earth and all that was thereon? When his soul was taken, God cast him into the fire where he longeth to be but one of the lowly of the earth who had never shown pride toward anyone in matters of faith. The fire of his pride toward God's creatures is a fire wherein he yearneth for relief, yet findeth no way of escape therefrom.O all things! Have mercy upon yourselves and consider your ultimate end about which there is no doubt. Ye shall be taken, then unto God, your Lord, shall ye return. Should time decree your death while ye are patient in His good-pleasure, ye shall enter Paradise after your death and therein shall ye dwell in delight. Therein shall ye have whatsoever your souls desire. God hath created therein of all things that which hath no equal, no likeness, no similitude, no peer, and no parallel. Will ye not then be thankful?But if during your lives ye attain unto that which giveth peace to your hearts without God's good-pleasure, then your knowledge shall be as fire unto your souls. This is God's fire in your lives, and after your death ye shall be tormented therein for as long as God willeth. I counsel you to show mercy unto yourselves and believe in God Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die and brought you to life, and Who giveth you glad tidings of meeting Him. This, verily, is of God's bounty unto all the worlds.While ye strive in your religion, on the Day when He shall make Himself known unto you, ye turn away from the presence of God, even as those among the People of the Book in the time of Muhammad whose glory it was to attain His presence and meet God in the countenance of His Beloved, prostrating themselves before Him. Yet they remained veiled and abide in the fire whereunto they shall forever cleave. Likewise did those who were given the Qur'an fail to attain the fruit of their being by meeting their Lord, though they might have comprehended this. God doth warn you hereby, for this shall render vain your souls and your works, if ye but perceive it.How many were the divines in Islam who believed in the true Imams and strove to win their good-pleasure, yet when they came into the presence of the Point of the Bayan, they denied the meeting with their Lord in that they failed to believe in the Manifestation of His Self.

Strive ye in their good-pleasure, for when they appeared before the Point of the Bayan, they denied the meeting with their Lord by virtue of not believing in the Manifestation of His Self, whilst they deemed themselves to be doing good. Thus doth God warn you at the time of the appearance of the Truth that ye, even as ye are in the Bayan, shall obey as ye know. But when He Whom God shall make manifest maketh Himself known unto you and calleth you unto His presence - He through Whom ye were created, sustained, caused to die and made to live - ye strive in your religion and act according to the command of God for which ye were created, thinking ye do good. Thus doth God warn you with a severe warning. Thus doth God make you to fear with a great fear. Thus doth God cause you to dread with a mighty dread. For without this, neither you nor your deeds shall be rendered vain, but this shall change your light into fire and your faith into error while ye perceive it not. Therefore watch over your souls that ye grieve not anyone, nor pass judgment upon any soul, lest ye pronounce judgment upon the Manifestation of your Lord or cause Him grief. This is what God hath counseled you that ye may be saved. Otherwise, a single 'nay' from Him Whom God shall make manifest shall suffice to render you all like unto those who were given the Book, nay worse than these, if ye would but remember. And if ye accept God, He will grant you from His presence stations of glory and guidance wherewith ye shall glory until the Day of Resurrection. He doeth what He willeth as He pleaseth. This is what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath ordained. Ye know the measure of the days of His Manifestation. Then believe ye in God with truth, and love not your faith in aught that would turn you away from His good-pleasure while ye know not. And profess ye the unity of God according to your capacity, by not associating any partner with Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor seeking anyone besides Him.The Second in the Second: In the Name of God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning! Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, and Thine the might and the power, and Thine the strength and the divinity, and Thine the force and the sovereignty, and Thine the grandeur and the majesty, and Thine the Face and the perfection, and Thine the power and the action, and Thine the similitude and the examples, and Thine the stations and the glory, and Thine the greatness and the independence, and Thine the awesomeness and the revelation, and Thine is whatsoever Thou lovest or desirest from the kingdom of Thy Command and creation, and Thine the might and the invincibility, and Thine the power and the exaltation, and Thine the sovereignty and the omnipotence, and Thine the joy and the gladness. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Individual, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Transcendent, Exalted. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Through Thy power Thou hast created all things \[...\]

O my God! By Thy power hast Thou created all things and set their measure, and by Thy will hast Thou fashioned all things and given them their form. By Thy glory, O my God! Were I to worship Thee from that beginning which hath no beginning unto that end which hath no end, my fear of Thee and my apprehension would not be removed. For perchance one day the Manifestation of Thy Self might recognize me while I remain veiled. This is what I fear and dread, for this is greater than any fire and more severe than any torment. Indeed, what Thou hast promised to those in the fire is created under the shadow of this. Yet my hope in Thee never ceases, nor my trust in Thy favor, even though I remain veiled from Thy commandments from that beginning which hath no beginning to that end which hath no end. If in the appearance of the Manifestation of Thy Self I should gaze upon His countenance with love for Him and faith in Him, this would suffice me and would rectify all that hath been and shall be decreed. For paradise lieth in Thy word through Thy love for Him, and the fire in Thy command concerning what Thou lovest not.Therefore, O God, preserve all Thy creation from being veiled from the Manifestation of Thy Self, and grant them patience concerning the Dayspring of Thy Being. For Thou hast warned them of this and caused them to fear that. Yet when I behold with mine eyes the diverse peoples upon the earth, after Thou hadst perfected Thy warning in Thy Books and completed Thy admonition through Thy Messengers, these peoples have not benefited, nor have they refrained from being veiled from the Manifestations that came after. Therefore my heart is not at ease concerning those who are in the Bayan, for they are like unto previous peoples who may be visited by that whereof they were warned and promised, yet they pay no heed nor accept His authority, even as I have witnessed concerning the Letter Vav on the Day of Resurrection - all hastening day and night seeking Thy good pleasure while remaining veiled from the Source of Thy good pleasure and the Manifestation of Thy Cause.Therefore, O God, aid all Thy creation through Thy grace however Thou willest, and as Thou willest, and through what Thou willest, and where Thou willest, and whensoever Thou willest. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning!Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself through the sovereignty of His omnipotence above all contingent beings, and praise be to God Who hath manifested His dominion through the power of His unique majesty above all existing things, and hath revealed His might through the authority of His Lordship above all created things, and hath shown His good pleasure through the expression of His eternal pleasure above all atoms, and hath demonstrated His power through the sovereignty of His holy oneness above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Glorified.He hath chosen for Himself a Mirror, resplendent, adorned, beautified, glorified, illumined, exalted, sanctified, elevated, inaccessible, sovereign, mighty, powerful, manifest, magnificent, hidden, and possessed of divine qualities. Then He revealed Himself unto it through itself, and through it He became inaccessible from it, and through it He became independent of all else, and He made it the station of His Self in fulfillment and decree throughout all the kingdoms of might and creation. Then He chose for it essential names \[...\]

Praise be to God, Who hath no peer or equal. He hath chosen for His creation spiritual names and abstract appellations, and hath filled therewith His heaven and His earth. Verily, there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Seeing. He warneth all things, save through recognition of the Point of the Bayan and what He hath ordained, until the Day when God shall illumine all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the Revealer of His Self and the Repository of His Mystery. On that Day all shall be brought before God, their Lord. God hath given them glad tidings of attaining His presence and of His good-pleasure. These are they who shall prosper.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Warning, the Most Warning. And verily all glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon them who resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity. I testify, if thou be among them who comprehend the Cause, that the warning of God proceedeth from His justice alone, and His glad tidings from His grace alone. If thou be among the denizens of the holy gardens of detachment and the chambers of glory and unity, then let thy warning be through the word "No" from the Sun of Truth, and thy glad tidings through His word "Yea." No greater warning than this, no greater glad tidings than that. And if thou descendest therefrom, then witness every shadow within the shadow of "No" and every glory within the shadow of "Yea."As long as thou livest, and after death, if thou be among those whom the Tree of Truth hath addressed through "No," then thou art in the fire, and there is no escape therefrom. And if thou be among those whom the Tree of Truth hath addressed through His word "Yea," then thou art in Paradise, and there is no escape therefrom. I counsel thee and all things to make your fear naught save the displeasure of God, even if it be not manifest, and your hope in naught save the good-pleasure of God, even if it be not manifest. For if one be not cognizant of God's good-pleasure when it encompasseth the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest regarding any soul, He shall bring him to naught ere His displeasure be made manifest concerning him.O all things! Make yourselves the essence of warning through the essence of fire and light, and look not for the appearance of their limits in the kingdom. Until now, I have found none who warned save through God's good-pleasure, nor anyone who hoped save through God's good-pleasure, but after certitude I found all manifesting their fear and hope. Therefore their dwelling is not in the summit of unity, nor their station in the sanctuary of detachment.Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye make yourselves the essence! By Him Who cleft Paradise asunder and created the breath of life, Who is sanctified in might, exalted in grandeur, and magnified in majesty and power, ye shall assuredly attain unto His presence, and He shall warn you with a fire the like of which hath never been created, while ye remain heedless. When ye become certain of this matter, ye shall all be brought low by His authority. He shall bestow upon you a Paradise the like of which hath never existed, while ye remain heedless, until when ye become certain thereof, ye shall all fall prostrate before Him and render thanks. Then will God bear witness against you without the essence of warning \[...\]

And ye are not mindful until when ye are assured, then do ye all prostrate yourselves and offer thanks. Then doth God bear witness concerning you without the essence of warning and glad tidings, and that testimony ye witness from every fire. And should He bear witness concerning anyone through the essence of glad tidings and warning, the dominion of the earth and whatsoever is thereon would have no glory over him, but ye do not understand and are not mindful. From the beginning that hath no beginning until now, ye have indeed known all things through Mine own Self. Hence, there have not appeared in the kingdom any servants in whom could be found the essence of warning and mercy, except that both of them are not defined by their limitations. O people of the Bayan! Ye do not expose your own selves. And it hath four ranks. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Treasured, the Most Treasured. Say: God is more treasured than every possessor of treasure. None can withhold himself from the sovereignty of His treasuring, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been a Treasurer, Treasuring, Treasured. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom doth praise whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are worshippers of Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Ruby Nature, then the Sovereignty and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who oppresseth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth not anything whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The treasure of what He hath created and will create - all through Him do they seek sufficiency. Say: Make ye everything a treasure for yourselves, for then on the Last Day ye shall be in want, unless ye make God your treasure in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. For if ye become in want, then through God your Lord shall ye find sufficiency. And make not God a treasure for yourselves unless ye make Him Whom God shall make manifest - verily all things do ye fear Him. Therefore fear ye God lest He remove from you the limits of your own selves, for verily ye shall be tested on the day of His manifestation. Perchance ye treasure for yourselves a single mithqal of gold, yet ye treasure not Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then look ye to the measure of your deeds and your faith, then seek forgiveness, then unto God your Lord do ye turn in repentance. If ye make all that is on earth a treasure for yourselves, it will not suffice you in place of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Will ye not perceive?

If you possess all things on earth and then repent and seek forgiveness, turning unto God your Lord - yet all that you have amassed as treasure will avail you naught when He Whom God shall make manifest appears. Do you not perceive this? Rather, you must watch over your souls, for you shall be sorely tried on the Day of Resurrection. Perchance your faith in God may not equal even one of your own houses, since you treasure the latter for yourselves while failing to treasure Him Whom God shall make manifest, neither using reason nor understanding. Instead you ponder upon those who came before you, content with far less, taking but a measure of silver while veiling yourselves from Him Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die and gave you life - even after proclaiming "We believe in God and in Him Whom God shall make manifest."If you should come to possess all that is on earth, yet detach yourselves from it and make Him Whom God shall make manifest your treasure before God, He would testify that you are believing servants. Otherwise, your station before God would be only that which He Whom God shall make manifest testifies. Therefore be vigilant and fear Him. For if you make all things on earth your treasure, you must inevitably relinquish them when you are taken, whereupon you shall enter the fire and be tormented therein as long as the heavens and earth and all that lies between them endure, except as God may will. This is how your treasure shall benefit you, if you but knew it.But if you make God your treasure, then even should you possess in this life but a grain of mustard seed, after your death you shall delight in Paradise as long as the heavens and earth endure. Would aught be diminished from such a treasure, if you but remembered? We have witnessed on the Day of Resurrection the stations of all creation, each treasuring something of God's kingdom, save those who have recognized God - these have treasured God their Lord. Indeed, God is ashamed to record their numbers in the Book, so few are they.Therefore watch over your souls, O people of the Bayan, that on the Day of Resurrection you may not be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Perchance you remember Him not, yet treasure a cup of water for yourselves, thereby showing gratitude to God Who created you, caused you to die and gave you life - neither using reason nor understanding. We have shown you all the paths of guidance that you may, on the Day of Resurrection, enter into all things with God's good-pleasure and be veiled from all else that lacks His good-pleasure.Say: God is my treasure in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. I have taken no other treasure besides Him, nor will I ever do so. Say: God is my refuge in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. I have taken no other refuge besides Him, nor will I ever do so. Say: God is my protection in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them. I have taken no other protection besides Him, nor will I ever do so. Say: God is my support in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth \[...\]

Say: God is my support in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no support other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: God is my might in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no might other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: God is my greatness in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no greatness other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: God is my protection in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no protection other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: God is my strength in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no strength other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: All that I have made God my Lord great for myself, I desired not, nor do I find any way to that except that I make Him Whom God shall make manifest my stronghold in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no stronghold other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is my treasure in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no treasure other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is my greatness in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no greatness other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is my refuge in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no refuge other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is my support in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no support other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is my protection in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. I have taken no protection other than Him, nor will I ever take any besides Him.But when ye recite these verses, they deny you, and ye shall witness on the Day of Resurrection how ye make every falsehood a treasure for yourselves, yet make neither God nor the Manifestation of His Self a treasure for yourselves, and ye imagine. Look ye at those who made falsehood their treasure from the beginning of this Cause, how We seized them, and they now possess naught save the fire, yet they perceive not. Therefore watch over yourselves, for ye shall indeed be questioned on the Day of Resurrection. Perchance ye make every base thing a treasure for yourselves and remember not, and when God makes you know the Manifestation of His Self, ye make Him not a treasure for yourselves, nor are ye fearful of Him. God hath created for you no fire more intense than this, if ye would but reflect a little.

And ye fear Him not. God hath created for you no fire more intense than this, if ye would but reflect. We have, verily, dissociated Ourselves from those who make not Him Whom God shall make manifest the treasure of their lives, both in death and in life. We shall cast them into the fire for this, and We shall be of those who exact retribution. Such is the recompense of him who maketh creation a treasure unto himself, yet maketh not God - Who created him and sustained him and caused him to die and brought him back to life - a treasure unto himself, though he declareth: "I am, verily, of them that believe in God and His signs." Say: If ye truly believe in God and His signs, how is it that ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest? Is there any path unto God save this, if ye would but reflect? And unto God is the ultimate end of those who fear Him and those who do good in His path.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Treasured, the Most TreasuredGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Force and the Celestial Realm, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Glory be unto Thee, O God! Lord of this Friday, bless those who have ascended unto Thee through what Thy knowledge hath encompassed of Thy glory, for verily Thou art possessed of mighty glory.

Send Thy blessings upon him who hath believed in Thee and then in what hath been ordained from Thy presence in the Bayan, through what knowledge hath encompassed of every good thing. Verily, Thou art the Encompasser of all things. The third in the third.

In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden! Praise be to God Who hath ascended in the loftiness of His Essence above all created things, and hath risen in His sublimity above all beings, and hath elevated Himself in His exaltation above all creatures, and hath manifested His revelation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath dominated through His dominion all who abide in the realms of names and attributes. I testify on this Friday, the Day of Independence, with a testimony purified from all other testimonies and independent of aught else, that should I attain unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, I shall testify to the Cause of God in such wise that I shall be independent of the testimony of all things, and shall sanctify His testimony above the testimony of all that hath been and shall be created. For this is what God hath testified and will testify throughout creation and invention. No path existeth for creation save this, and no way remaineth for servants except this. He sufficeth as the All-Seeing and the Witness, He sufficeth as the All-Knowing and the Omniscient, He sufficeth as the All-Powerful and the Almighty, He sufficeth as the All-Subduing and the All-Compelling, He sufficeth as the Manifest and the Helper, He sufficeth as the Reckoner and the All-Accounting, He sufficeth as the Helper and the Succourer, He sufficeth as the Preserver and the Guardian, He sufficeth as the Most Hidden and the Treasured, He sufficeth as the Most Great and the All-Glorious, He sufficeth as the Refuge and the Shelter, He sufficeth as the Supporter and the Defender, He sufficeth as the Mighty and the All-Powerful. Verily, there is no God but Him, alone with no partner, and verily the Seven Letters are His servant and His Word, and verily all the paths of the Bayan and the decrees of the first and last of creation, from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end, God shall make manifest from His presence as He pleaseth by His command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden! Praise be to God, beside Whom there is no other God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon those who resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen except the Primal Unity. I testify that God hath ever been and will ever be too exalted to be a treasure unto any of His creation. However, since God hath created all things for His knowledge and worship, He hath opened for them a path in creation beyond which nothing is possible in invention, and hath made Him Whom God shall make manifest the Sun of Truth, purified from all that is attributed unto Him. If thou makest Him thy treasure, thou hast made God thy treasure. But watch thyself on the Day of Resurrection, for perchance thou mayest treasure that which hath no glory and treasure it not, and be veiled from Him. And if thou art not convinced of this, then remember what transpired regarding the Point of the Bayan, that should anyone make Him a treasure for what he desireth, His knowledge encompasseth not any grief in that regard, for all His grief is for that which is not pleasing, that they should make Him a treasure for what they desire. Therefore hath been written in His path what hath been earned \[...\]

And if thou art not convinced of this, then remember what was decreed by the Point of the Bayan when He made it a treasure for what He loved. His knowledge was not encompassed by sorrow in this, for all His sorrow was for that which was not pleased to be made a treasure for what He desired. Therefore, He hath written in His path what He hath gained. And thou, on the Day of Resurrection, being enchanted by this, must watch over thyself that thou makest none other than Him thy treasure. And shouldst thou find between earth and heaven the red elixir, verily this would not suffice thee, but this would suffice thee. And watch over thyself with true vigilance, for thy salvation lieth in this and thy destruction in being veiled from this. If thou makest Him Whom God shall make manifest thy treasure, thou shalt never lose in thy transaction, even if thou art slain in like manner as those who were martyred in God's path made the Point of the Bayan their treasure. Then how dost thou see them all remembered? And those who made Him not their treasure possessed naught and were upon the earth as thou seest. How can they possess any good when they died and became dust and entered into the fire wherein they shall not be helped? And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Treasured, the Most Treasured. There is no God but He, the Most Treasured, the Most Treasured. Say: God is more treasured than every possessor of treasures. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of His treasured sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Treasurer, the Treasuring, the Treasured. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom doth glorify whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. Say: All are devoted to Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. And exalted is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Living, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and He is the Living, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God giveth life to all things, and He is the Living, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God causeth all things to die, and He is the Living, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Resurrector of all things, and He is the Truth, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: In Whose hand is the dominion of all things, if ye but know? Say: In God's hand is the creation of the heavens \[...\]

He is the True One, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling!Say: In whose hand is the dominion of all things, if ye but knew? Say: In God's hand is the creation of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. He saith "Be," and it is. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and by His command are all raised up. Unto God belongeth all might in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is Mighty, Most Powerful, the All-Powerful. Unto God belongeth all power in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Ordainer, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.Say: Verily, He shall bless those who turn unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they shall believe in what God revealeth unto Him. These are they who are guided by God's guidance and mercy, and these are they who are rightly guided. God hath created Paradise for them, wherein they shall abide forever, and therein shall they have whatsoever their souls desire. And God shall increase His bounty unto those who fear Him and who show patience in His path.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation and the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. He it is Who scattered creation and then reassembleth it. Do ye not see? He it is Who giveth life and death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: In whose hand is the dominion of all things? Verily, unto Him shall all return. Say: Verily, He Who created you is able to recreate you, and He hath power over all things. Say: There is none other than the Sun of Truth who is your beginning and your end, this by God's leave. Do ye not see?Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and unto God shall all return. Say: In whose hand is the dominion of all things? Verily, unto Him shall all return. Say: In God's hand, Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and unto Him shall all be turned. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all be raised. Say: Victory is in God's hand alone - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants. He is the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.Say: In whose hand is the dominion of all things? Verily, unto Him shall all return. Say: In God's hand, Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and His command is nearer than "Be, and it is." Say: Through God do ye dwell, through God are ye helped, through God do ye appear. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and unto God shall all return.Say: God shall verily send His blessings upon every Throne of His Manifestation, both past and future. There is no God but Him, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Say: God shall verily send His blessings upon the Throne of His Manifestation in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Say: Every Throne of Manifestation is this one, and all stand through this. Say: Every Throne of Manifestation is He Whom God shall make manifest; all shall return unto Him. And whosoever taketh unto himself a protector other than Him or followeth anyone without His leave - these are the companions of the Fire, and these are they who are far removed from God's good-pleasure. Say: God giveth life and causeth death.

Say: In His hand is the dominion of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and by His command do all things stand. Sufficient is God unto me, Who hath created me and provided for me, Who causeth me to die and giveth me life, and Who showereth upon me the wonders of His mercy. Verily there is no God but Him. He aideth whom He willeth through His command. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving. Say: He is the Subduer above you and before you, the Manifest behind you, the Inaccessible at your right hand, the Exalted at your left, the Most High above your heads, and the All-Compelling over you from every direction. He will assuredly help you by night and by day, and will raise you up as He pleaseth through His command. He is the One, the Sovereign. That is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. He is the One Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He giveth life and causeth death. He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The Gate is indeed the Truth from God, even as ye yourselves speak in the knowledge of God. Say: He is the Knower of every soul. He knoweth what it hath earned and witnesseth what it earneth. He is indeed the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Is one whom God teacheth from His presence like unto one who learneth from His creation? Glory be to God! This is in the highest heights and that is in the lowest depths. Say: Both are from God through what He revealeth from His presence. Will ye not then be thankful? Say: Praise be to God Who hath taught me the knowledge of all things from His presence before any of His creation taught me. Verily He was All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Informed. These are the verses of God. God hath taught me, and none among the worlds hath learned this. This befitteth none but God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the East and the West, the Lord of the visible and the invisible, the Lord of the worlds. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. Glory be to Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God; there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, and the Earthly Domain. Thine are the Glory and the Majesty, Thine are the Countenance and the Perfection, Thine are the Face and the Beauty, Thine are the Similitude and the Examples, Thine are the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine are the Greatness and the Independence, Thine are the Awesomeness and the Revelation, Thine are the Might and the Inaccessibility, Thine is the Power \[...\]

Thine is the power and exaltation, Thine the gladness and joy, Thine the sovereignty and dominion, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love. Thou hast verily aided me with true aid, wherefore praise be unto Thee, O my God. Thou hast preserved me with true preservation, wherefore thanks be unto Thee, O my Beloved. Thou hast strengthened me with true strength, wherefore praise be unto Thee, O my Adored One. Thou hast empowered me with true might, wherefore glory be unto Thee, O my Heart's Desire.Thou hast ever been the One existing before all things, the Being above all things, the Essence with all things, the Creator of all things, and the Essence after the passing of all things. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Unique, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Sovereign, the All-Powerful, the Most Holy, the Everlasting, the Eternal, the Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things by Thy power and ordained them by measure. By Thy will Thou hast formed all things and fashioned them by design.Glorified art Thou and exalted art Thou! I shall praise Thee beyond all that contingent beings have praised or will praise Thee. I shall glorify Thee above all that beings have glorified or will glorify Thee. I shall exalt Thee beyond all that essences have exalted or will exalt Thee. I shall magnify Thee above all that realities have magnified or will magnify Thee. I shall honor Thee beyond all that the honored ones have honored or will honor Thee.Thy grandeur hath ever been sovereign over all Thy creation, and Thy manifestation exalted above all Thy servants. All bow down before the sublimity of Thy sovereignty and humble themselves before the loftiness of Thy station. Thou hast ever been living and diest not, a king that passeth not away, a justice that wrongeth not, a sovereign that changeth not, and One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.O God! Thou shalt verily assist the guides of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with all Thy assistance, preserve them with all Thy preservation, guard them with all Thy protection, strengthen them with all Thy might, exalt them with all Thy majesty, and elevate them with all Thy exaltation. For Thou art the Subduer over all things, the Manifest above all things, the Inaccessible before all things, the Most Exalted after all things, and the Sovereign over the heights of all things. All are fearful of Thy might and all are apprehensive of Thy love.Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, Thou art the Eternal, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.The Third within the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, hath prevailed through the sovereignty of His might above all created things, hath manifested through the power of His eternity above all beings, hath magnified Himself through the grandeur of His Self-Subsistence above all atoms, and hath triumphed through the sovereignty of His holy oneness above all who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes. His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the Powerful, the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling.

By the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Supreme Subduer, the All-Conquering, the Helper, the Supreme Helper, the All-Aiding, the Manifest, the Supreme Manifest, the Most Pure, the Glorious, the Supreme Glorious, the All-Glorious - His mercy hath preceded all who dwell in the kingdom of His heaven and earth, wherein He hath ordained for all things the recognition of His eternity and hath willed that all things enter the sacred heights of His love. Therefore, He and all His creation testify that every object of worship from above His throne to the depths of His earth is a worshipper of His Self, and that none is worthy of worship except Him. He is the One deserving of worship by right and the Object of all seeking in His independence. All things have worshipped God before and after, from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end, and all things shall worship God from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end, and we are all worshippers of God.Then He and all things testify that when He was the Impenetrable Unknown, the Exalted Essence, the Transcendent Origin, the Sovereign Substance, and the Powerful Abstract Being, He chose for Himself an exalted Essence. Then He revealed Himself to it through it by His Self and made it the source of all He hath created and will create. Nay, He sanctified it beyond such description, for the glory of all created things derives from the glory of His Manifestation. He joined the acknowledgment of His oneness with allegiance to His Cause, the recognition of His Reality with the acknowledgment of His eternality, the confession of His primacy with the attestation of His everlastingness, and the recognition of every perfection possible in creation with what He possesseth of all names and attributes. And we are all believers in this.Then God chose for that Supreme Essence and Most Glorious Abstract Being wondrous names, through which He revealed Himself to all in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. When the First Unity entered the limitless ocean, none could reckon save God all the evidences from before and after that there is no God but Him, the One, the Treasured. And verily the Being of the triangular letters before the square is the Manifestation of His Self in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, calling all unto God, the One, the All-Compelling, Who created all things by His command. Verily there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the All-Forgiving.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Treasured, the Most Treasured. There is no God but Him, the Most Treasured, the Most Treasured. And verily the Glory from God is upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen but the First Unity. Furthermore, I testify that in all names the Outward is one Name and the Inward is one Name, the First is one Name and the Last is one Name, the All-Compelling is one Name, and that is He Whom God shall make manifest - exalted and sublime be His mention and exalted and elevated be His station. Verily all within Him guideth unto God - needs must He guide unto Him in his heart, and unto the Manifestations of His Cause in the stations of his spirit, soul and body. And we are all believers in what is revealed in the Bayan. I testify that the essence of religion \[...\]

We all believe in what is revealed in the Bayan. Bear thou witness that the essence and substance of religion is contained in two phrases: "There is no God but God" and that the Being of the Seven Letters is the servant of God. Then all measures from the paths of all things are from Him according to what hath been revealed in the Bayan with all the fruits of that Paradise. And these two phrases, when manifested, become four phrases, and the First Living One is God's guide, and verily the Bayan is God's proof. Then when these four are separated, thou seest the paths of all things in the Bayan, all returning to one word: "There is no God but God." Therefore hold fast unto Him Whom God shall make manifest in the beginning of His manifestation, before the second word appeareth from the first word, for this is an exalted and lofty glory, and a transcendent and sublime majesty. There is no power nor strength except in God, the Most High, the Most Great.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. There is no God but He, the Most Great, the Most Great. Say: God is greatest above all greatness. None can withhold himself from the dominion of the Sovereign of His protection, neither anyone in the heavens nor anyone on earth nor what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are worshippers before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Truth that dieth not, and the King that passeth not away, and the Justice that wrongeth not, and the Sovereign that changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will protect whomsoever He willeth among His servants by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Supreme Protector, the Preserver, the Mighty. Say: Verily protection lieth in His good-pleasure in all things. Will ye not then seek His protection? Say: Without protection is without His good-pleasure. Will ye not then be God-fearing? Say: At the end of every Manifestation is the beginning of their protection and their steadfastness in their religion, for otherwise they are in the fire in God's sight, or else they enter into a religion. Do ye not observe those who were given the Gospel? They were steadfast in their religion, but when God manifested the Manifestation of His Self, lo, their protection and their steadfastness were changed to the greatest error.

They pass judgment with the greatest error, while they themselves neither reflect nor understand, even after hearing the verses of God from His Messenger. Thus do you, after the Pharisees in the Bayan, bear witness. Indeed, in Islam there were servants who never contemplated aught save God's good-pleasure, yet in God's sight they were of the essence of fire, while they themselves supposed they were doing good. Say: This concept of infallibility is the greatest error in God's Book. Fear God at the time of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and be conscious of Him. Say: Verily, infallibility is the good-pleasure of God in whatsoever proceedeth from the Manifestation of His Self. Walk ye in this path in your private and public lives, in your beginning and your end, in your outer and inner beings, in your absence and presence, and then be conscious of God. When ye are alone between yourselves and God, follow naught but what the Bayan hath revealed, and transgress not by a grain's weight. Be not those who outwardly manifest while inwardly change, for this is contrary to your infallibility. But God will forgive you if He willeth, and will transform every fire into light from His presence. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: The ocean of infallibility is Him Whom God shall make manifest. Should all on earth enter therein, prostrating before Him, they would be instantly purified. And whoso seeketh refuge in infallibility throughout his life yet remaineth veiled from Him hath indeed committed the greatest error, and God will not forgive him unless he returneth unto God his Lord and becometh of those who prostrate themselves. This is the path of God, from before and after, for the God-fearing. Say: Whoso declareth "I believe in God and what was revealed in the Bayan unto the Primal Point," hath entered the ocean of infallibility and become of the believers. But none shall confirm this save Him Whom God shall make manifest, and whoso confirmeth this, God hath clothed him in the robe of mercy from His presence. O people of grace! Ye shall attain unto this grace. Say: Verily, infallibility in the night is naught save the night of the martyrs who call you to the inmost of the inmost while ye follow behind veils, but on the day of the outmost of the outmost ye shall rend those veils. For whoso followeth Him Whom God shall make manifest as he would follow the martyrs of the Bayan - such have no knowledge. They follow truth as they would follow creation, and God hath not made them martyrs save by the command of the Point of the Bayan. Fear ye God on the Day of Manifestation that ye may comprehend pure truth. If ye desire, I shall show you true infallibility with God. Look ye to those whom God hath willed in the inmost of the inmost, for these are they who are purified in God's sight, having desired their Lord. All were created for this, yet all remain veiled. And those who have rent the veils and desired that for which they were created - these exceed not the number one, and these are they who shall be transformed in God's Book. This is what is decreed with God, not what ye consciously observe by night and day within yourselves.

I bear witness that We have witnessed a thousand and a thousand thousand, without limit in number, in the Book. We shall therefore judge them accordingly, though We were not witnesses. Yea, in the mystery of the Cause are servants who have sought God, been God-fearing, and followed the ordinances of the Furqan. These are they who are accounted believers before God. God hath chosen them and made them witnesses from His presence, and these are they who are honored.However, what hath issued from the ocean of the Furqan regarding the essence of the Cause is what We have mentioned in the Book. And had We witnessed less than that, We would still have remembered them.O all things! As for that which ye were commanded in all the Books - that ye should seek God and turn unto Him - how is it that ye remain still and patient while they have sought the Truth and have arisen to fulfill that for which they were created? These are they who are the triumphant ones.God shall soon choose from among those who possess the Bayan servants who shall appear before Him Who God shall make manifest and act according to His command. They desire naught save God and seek none but Him. Follow not your own selves throughout your nights, for ye shall find no path to the Sun of Truth except on the Day of Resurrection. Then whoso hath been granted this bounty from the Book of God shall comprehend the Cause of his Lord and shall be among those who are present before Him Whom God shall make manifest.He followeth God in ways he knoweth not and comprehendeth not. When God willeth to make Himself known, then all shall know Him. This is what God and the Point of the Bayan have promised you in the Bayan. This is the Day for which ye were created. Present yourselves, therefore, before God, for this is your protection in following the paths of your religion, since all this ye do by God's command.The day they presented themselves alive, that first day was the beginning of the Resurrection. Say: All things shall perish save the face of thy Lord, the Sovereign, the All-Powerful. And even if there be living creatures besides them, they shall present themselves before God. Yet God hath servants on earth who act according to His command.Say: These are they whom He hath guided, and God guideth the first ones when they have attained unto the Cause of their Lord before the believers. Therefore observe from the first day of the Resurrection until the last - ye shall witness the mystery of the Cause in all things.Say: God will verily protect whomsoever He willeth among His servants by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things. Say: The Most Great Protection is that ye desire naught save what God desireth. If ye hold fast to this path, then ye are protected. Otherwise, the moment ye deviate from the path of protection, ye are cast out. This is what God bestoweth specially upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: The protection of Him Whom God shall make manifest is like the protection of the sun, and the protection of him who believeth in Him is like the protection of mirrors. Ye all witness protection in God's Cause. Say: Protection is what God commandeth. If the heart of anyone is not veiled from the remembrance of God to the extent that the thought of aught else occurs to him, then he is recorded in God's Book among the protected ones.Say: Who besides the Sun of Truth and then the guides to His Self can traverse that ocean, if ye be of them that know the truth. The Second in the Second. In the name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. Glory be to Thee, O my God \[...\]

The protection of him who believes in Him is like the protection of mirrors -- you all witness every protection in the Cause of God. Say: Protection is what God commands. If the heart of anyone is not veiled from the remembrance of God to the extent that the thought of others occurs to him, then he is assuredly among those who are protected in the Book of God. Say: Who besides the Sun of Truth and then His representatives can guide others to traverse that ocean, if you truly know.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great! Glory be to Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and Human Nature, then the Glory and Majesty, then the Countenance and Beauty, then the Face and Perfection, then the Symbol and Symbols, then the Stations and Grandeur, then the Greatness and Independence, then the Awesomeness and Manifestation, then the Glory and Invincibility, then the Power and Exaltation, then the Joy and Gladness, then the Sovereignty and Might, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation.Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Independent, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Subduing, Most Holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast caused the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them to dwell by Thy command, and Thou hast ordained the ways of all things by Thy will. Thou hast ever been existent before all things, bringing all things into being after all things, and existing above all things. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.I bear witness that the Sun of Thy Reality was and is and ever shall be preserved through Thy protection, and shall forever be preserved through Thy power, Thy might, Thy glory, Thy majesty, and the splendor of Thy sovereignty. For all protection is manifested through His good-pleasure, and all else is established without His good-pleasure. Therefore, O my God, adorn all who are in the Bayan with the acceptance of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, who are steadfast, who desire naught but what He desireth, who will naught but what He willeth, who are able to do only what He hath ordained, who decree only what He hath decreed, who permit only what He hath permitted, who defer only what He hath deferred, and who write only what He hath written, that they may attain the bounty of that Name from Thee and the existence of that Name from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Protected, the Most Protected! Praise be to God Who hath risen in the exaltation of His Self-Subsistence above all created things\[...\]

Praise be to God Who hath risen in the transcendence of His Self-Subsistence above all contingent things, and hath prevailed through His primordial sovereignty over all created things, and hath manifested through the revelation of His oneness above all existing things, and hath exalted Himself through the elevation of His Self-Subsistence above all atoms, and hath remained inaccessible through the inaccessibility of His sanctity above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Protecting.He hath chosen for Himself a subtle mirror, an impregnable essence, a lofty abstraction, a pristine purity, and a resplendent simplicity. He hath clothed it with the garment of infallibility in its mission, in its beginning and its end, its outer and its inner aspects, its hidden and its manifest qualities. He hath caused it to speak that which He desired it to speak, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word - all appear by His command from His presence.Then He chose for Himself Names and eternal mirrors, simple realities, pure essences, and abstract substances. Then He revealed Himself to them through them while remaining inaccessible to them. Thus did the sun of His manifestation shine upon them all, and the signs of His concealment became established in and upon them. He clothed them with His infallibility in all that they imagined, revealed, uttered and manifested, lest they should indicate aught save God, or speak except from God, or desire save what God hath desired, or will save what God hath willed, or have power save what God hath ordained, or decree save what God hath decreed, or permit save what God hath permitted, or set terms save what God hath set, or write save what God hath written.Then were created mirrors facing those mirrors, all deriving light from the Sun of Truth, guided by its infallibility, seeking its good pleasure, and empowered by what is destined with it. These are the guides to His letters, all pointing to none but God, deriving light from none but God, desiring none and seeking none save Him. They glorify God by night and by day and tire not.And verily all names of goodness are in the grasp of God, exalted be His glory, appearing only from the Throne of Reality and the Seat of Oneness. Consider this as the example of one who receives a position of honor from the True King - how he manifests it, takes pride in it, gives thanks to the one who bestowed it, and shows humility before him, even if this be for a year or more or less within worldly limitations \[...\]

And even though this is according to his age, whether above or below that within worldly bounds and individual manifestations, if thou dost comprehend Him Whom God shall make manifest and He bestoweth upon thee a goodly station from His presence, thou shalt not demean His glory, for this shall endure until the Day of Resurrection. And if thou shouldst not manifest according to the merit of what He hath given thee, We shall assuredly purify according to the bestowal of anyone from the lowly worldly stations. For verily I have witnessed the Day of Resurrection and the degrees of creation, and I am ashamed to mention it. However, I shall assuredly educate those who are in the Bayan for the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that if ye comprehend that manifest and conquering Truth, and that sovereign, transcendent and omnipotent King, ye shall not demean the stations which God bestoweth upon you. For if ye were to make all that is on earth the glory of His mention of you, it would not equal it - how then do ye pride yourselves on the mention of your earthly king and speak of it among people, and thereby exalt yourselves in your seats and take pride? Even though this shall not endure for you, nor shall anyone among the people of knowledge remember you thereby. And this is in the path of your worldly life - how much more so the mention of the Creator of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, Who, when He maketh mention of a thing, every thing mentioneth it as befitting, and this endureth until the Day of Resurrection. Therefore, take heed unto yourselves on the Day of Resurrection that ye demean not the commands of Truth nor make them seem light, for this is the greatest thing in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them for those endued with knowledge who are assured of God and His signs. And it hath four stations: The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Decisive, the Most Decisive. There is no God but He, the Most Decisive, the Most Decisive. Say: God is more decisive than any decisiveness. None can resist the sovereign power of His decisiveness, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been decisive, determining, and conclusive. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom singeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Realm of Names, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heav\[...\]

Exalted is He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Glorified be He in Whose hand is the dominion of all things, and unto Him shall all return. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and unto God shall all be raised. He it is Who created you and whatsoever ye know. He it is Who heareth whosoever calleth upon Him, and verily He is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He it is Who answereth the prayers of them that believe in God and His signs, and who are assured of Him Whom God shall make manifest. We invoke blessings upon them who invoke blessings upon Him Whom God shall make manifest, for they are sincere in their faith. We have bestowed upon him who first inquired concerning His mention five mithqals of gold as ransom for His outward name, then six mithqals for His inward name. We do seek forgiveness for this, inasmuch as were all that is in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them to be expended, it would not equal the splendor of His mention, how much less could it be a ransom for the mention of His own Name, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. His is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. This is of His dominion, and We are, by God's leave, powerful over it. None possesseth so much as a qirat save by His leave, and We do dispose thereof by His leave at all times. Say: Ye navigate in the ocean of names, and there is none other God but God, and all are His worshippers. He is the First in the eternity of eternities, then the Last that hath ever been and ever shall be, then the Manifest in the kingdom of sanctity and glory, then the Hidden in the realm of might and beauty. He createth what He willeth by His command, and verily there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Most Exalted. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth. We are among those who prostrate before Him. And if ye navigate in the ocean of primal creation, then observe the Sun, and at each of its risings ye shall witness every Manifestation. Say: Verily He Who speaketh in Muhammad the Apostle is He Who spoke through Ali before Muhammad, and He Who speaketh through him in truth, and We are among those who hearken unto Him. He it is Who speaketh in Him Whom God shall make manifest - that Spirit of God's command through which God breatheth into whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily there is none other God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Were the veil to be lifted from the eyes of all the peoples of the earth, they would behold their Prophet in the grasp of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for they are not prophets except by God's command from His presence. This is that command of God from Him. Will ye not then be thankful for this? He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Descend not from the ocean of primal creation, for beyond that are the stations of those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all stand in their ranks before God. There is none other God but God, and We are among those who prostrate before Him. We have bestowed upon the first who asked the number of the Gate, then upon him who asked thereafter the number of the Waw, that all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens \[...\]

And were We to bestow upon the first Who was asked the number of the Gate, and thereafter was asked the number of the Waw, all who dwell in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that lieth between them would assuredly testify that there is none other God but Him, and that all are His servants and all bow down before Him. Say: The first Who was asked was the Sun of Truth, and the first Who answered was the Sun of Truth. All make mention through the remembrance of God from His presence, and all distinguish according to what hath been distinguished. Glory be unto Thee, O my Lord! Forgive me for what hath expired in Thy path, for verily all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them cannot equal the radiance of a single hair that is attributed unto Thee. Glory be unto Thee! There is none other God but Thee. Glory be unto Thee! I, verily, have been of the transgressors. Yet that which is attributed unto Thee is greater than all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and we have ever gloried therein. Blessed are they who spend their wealth in remembrance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and blessed are they who take hold of these and those, though perchance they may attain unto His Revelation while they believe not. Then God will forbid unto them all that they have taken through His remembrance, and will multiply it unto them who believe in Him and who are assured of the Hereafter. Unto God belongeth the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: God giveth life and causeth to die, and unto Him shall all return. His is whatsoever resteth in the night and in the day. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He Who \[...\]

In His hand is all things, and unto Him do all return. Say: In the hand of God, Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God apportioneth amongst His servants the measure of all things - can ye not perceive? From the first to the last, from the manifest to the hidden, all things are in the hand of God, Who verily apportioneth even unto what passeth through an ant's mind. Thus doth God show you His signs - can ye not perceive? And unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: In His hand is the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and unto Him shall all be raised up. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. His is the creation and the command, before and after. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. And unto God belongeth the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: In His hand is the dominion of all things, and unto Him do all return. Say: In the hand of God, Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command, verily we are them that remember Him. Say: God will assuredly break asunder with truth - He is the Subduer of the worlds. Say: Verily God will break asunder with justice - He is the Compeller of the worlds. Say: Verily God will break asunder with truth - He is the Stern One of the worlds. Say: Verily God will break asunder with truth - He is the Overcomer of the worlds. Say: Verily God will break asunder with truth - He is the Vanquisher of the worlds. Say: God will assuredly take vengeance on them that act with tyranny in the earth to the extent of a mustard seed, and He will take vengeance on them by His command - He is mighty and severe. Say: Transgress not the bounds of the Bayan, for God hath angels to the measure that ye exceed who will take vengeance on you. And be watchful on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest lest ye judge those who believe in Him by the bounds of the Bayan, for on that Day all sovereignty belongeth in truth unto Him, and all abide by His command. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and by His command are all transformed. We have no God but God - verily we are them that bow down before Him. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all be transformed. For He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Severe, the Most SevereGlorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, and Thine the might and the power, and Thine the strength and the divinity, and Thine the force and the sapphire, and Thine the sovereignty and the human realm, and Thine the glory and the majesty\[...\]

Thine is the majesty and the glory, Thine the grandeur and the beauty, Thine the countenance and the perfection, Thine the greatness and the independence, Thine the reverence and the sublimity, Thine the might and the invincibility, Thine the power and the exaltation, Thine the joy and the radiance, Thine the dominion and the detachment, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, everlasting, sovereign, all-compelling, holy, ever-abiding, self-dependent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither companion nor son, nor had Thou any partner in what Thou didst create, nor any helper in what Thou didst fashion. Thou didst create all things through Thy power and ordain them by Thine ordinance, and fashion them according to Thy design. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for all that Thou hast created and wilt create, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for all that Thou hast fashioned and wilt fashion. Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then to die and to live, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for the wonders of Thy favors, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved, for the subtleties of Thy bounties. The fragrances of Thy holy throne have ever been diffused and the gems of the glory of Thy sovereign might made manifest. None besides Thee can truly break anything - Thou art He Who hath broken the hearts, the spirits, the souls and the bodies, and then the attributes that appear from these essences and their like that derive from these realities. Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thine is the might and the bounty, Thine the glory and the exaltation, Thine the victory and the dominion, Thine the grandeur and the power, Thine the similitude and the examples. How great art Thou in sovereignty! How exalted art Thou in station! How invincible art Thou in loftiness! How mighty art Thou in proof! How supreme art Thou in bounty! Nothing escapeth Thy knowledge, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, nor can anything frustrate Thee, whether in the kingdom of command and creation or below them. Thou hast ever been the Healer of the oppressed, the Breaker of tyrants, the Destroyer of aggressors, the Chastiser of the proud, and the Enricher of those who veil themselves from Thy countenance, O Beloved of the worlds! Thou hast exalted Thyself through Thy might above all contingent beings, magnified Thyself through Thy greatness above all existing things, elevated Thyself through Thy loftiness above all created things, empowered Thyself through Thy power above all essences, established Thy sovereignty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, manifested Thy revelation above all atoms, and demonstrated Thy dominion above all symbols and allusions. The names of Thy compulsion have ever been just with Thee, and the names of Thy bounty excellent in Thy kingdom. When Thou dost clothe Thyself with compulsion, that is from Thy justice, for verily Thou art the Compeller of compellers.

All praise be unto God Who, by virtue of His transcendent Being, hath ascended above all contingent things, Who by the exaltation of His eternity hath risen above all created things, Who by the invincibility of His sovereign might hath remained inaccessible above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who by the overwhelming power of His royal dominion hath proven victorious over all contingent things. His creation beareth witness, as doth He Himself, that there is none other God but Him, His existence precedeth all that was before in the eternity of eternities, and His permanence endureth beyond all that cometh after, forever and evermore. He is the One, the Peerless, in the sanctuary of holiness and beauty, and the One, the Unique, in the heights of glory and majesty.He hath chosen an exalted Essence, a lofty Reality, a refined Countenance, a near Camphor-like Being, and an eternal Essence. Then He revealed Himself unto it through itself, and cast into its identity the likeness of its own being. Thus were manifested from it its signs, its attributes, its revelations, its emanations, its appearances, its will, and whatsoever is attributed to it in the Mother Book by virtue of what hath appeared from it. Then He chose for that Essence primary mirrors and immersed them in the sea of Oneness, whereupon every heaven and earth was filled thereby, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. The proof of this lieth in the verses of God, whereby God hath manifested the Tree of the Bayan with all that is in it and upon it, and whereby God shall manifest the sign of His Own Self on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.And the names of Thy loving-kindness are excellent in Thy Kingdom. If Thou shouldst manifest Thyself as the Compeller, this proceedeth from Thy justice, for Thou art the Compeller of compellers. And if Thou shouldst destroy the unbelievers, verily Thou art the Subduer of subduers. Thy decree hath ever been justice wherein no injustice can enter, and Thy judgment hath ever been equity which hath no equal. If Thou shouldst transform fire through Thy light, this proceedeth from Thy grace, and if Thou shouldst cause anyone to enter the shadow of Thy affirmation after having consigned him to negation, this proceedeth from Thy bounty and favor. Thou causest all things to enter the ocean of Thy grace, for Thou art in truth the Munificent, the True Bestower. And if Thou shouldst cause them to enter the ocean of Thy justice, verily Thou art the Just Compeller and the True Subduer.Glorified art Thou! Glorified art Thou! Thy munificence dominateth all created things and Thy generosity transcendeth all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thou hast called all Thy creation to enter the ocean of Thy grace, yet they remain veiled from Thy creation inasmuch as they enter not of their own accord into the boundless ocean of Thy grace and the unfathomable sea of Thy favor. Wherefore, O God, raise up servants possessed of might and power, and make them the manifestations of Thy compelling power in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and of Thy subduing power in the kingdoms of creation and command and whatsoever lieth beneath them. Thou shalt assuredly show forth in the Bayan the truth of Thy grace, and cause those who are not of it to enter therein through Thy compelling and subduing power. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.

In the Name of God, the Most Crushing, the Most Crushing! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no God, the Most Crushing, the Most Crushing. And verily all glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One, wherein naught can be seen except that First One.I testify that God hath ever been the All-Knowing, having knowledge of all things and power over all things. Beware, beware lest thou acquire in the path of any Manifestation except what God hath ordained. For if thou shouldst acquire other than this, the Names of Protection shall overturn thee, and the Manifestations of the Names of the All-Compelling shall cause justice to flow concerning thee.Fear God greatly through that Name, for verily He, exalted and glorified be He, is the Crusher of tyrants and the Compeller of oppressors. Should anyone acquire aught in the path of the Manifestation of His Self, He will assuredly take vengeance through His might, His power, His dominion, His sovereignty, His transcendence, His omnipotence, His supremacy, His authority, His rule, and His kingship, and through His Names and Attributes.This is a Name that bringeth joy to Him Whom God shall make manifest and to whomsoever is clothed with that raiment. When thou beholdest on the Day of His Manifestation one who hath caused Him grief, be thou his crusher, for he is an unjust oppressor.Take from this the key of knowledge and act, for on the Day of the Manifestation of Truth, the Daysprings of negation in their remoteness are transient, while the Dawning-Places of affirmation in their nearness are established. Blessed is he who through God crusheth the signs of negation and through God compelleth those near tokens, and through God breaketh the tyrant of compellers and the oppressor of oppressors in the Dawning-Places of affirmation and the Rising-Points of the transcendent, the inaccessible, the sublime.By thy life! On the Day of His Manifestation, when thou art clothed with this raiment, none of thy knowledge shall have honor with Him unless it be acted upon. This is what God, the Manifest, the Inaccessible, the Compeller, the Most Great, the Oppressor, the Most High, the Supreme, hath counseled thee.It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Safe, the Most Safe! There is no God but He, the Most Safe, the Most Safe! Say: God is safer than every possessor of safety. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His safety. Verily He is the Safe, the Secure, the Protected.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrating before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are worshipping Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth.

Neither in the earth nor in all that lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Glorified be God at such time as ye glorify Him, and glorified be God at such time as ye render Him victorious, and glorified be God at such time as ye bear Him, and glorified be God at such time as ye write, and glorified be God at such time as ye acknowledge, and glorified be He at such time as ye preserve, and glorified be God at such time as ye contemplate. And glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and sovereignty, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and grandeur, and glorified be God, the Lord of power and divinity, and glorified be the Lord of strength and ruby light, and glorified be God, the Lord of earthly sovereignty and the kingdom of names, and glorified be God, the Lord of glory and majesty, and glorified be God, the Lord of divine countenance and beauty, and glorified be God, the Lord of divine visage and perfection, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and action, and glorified be God, the Lord of metaphor and similitude, and glorified be God, the Lord of divine stations and sublimity, and glorified be God, the Lord of mercy and bounty, and glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and justice, and glorified be God, the Lord of grandeur and independence, and glorified be God, the Lord of glory and majesty, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and inaccessibility, and glorified be God, the Lord of power and exaltation, and glorified be God, the Lord of joy and gladness, and glorified be God, the Lord of divine authority and sovereignty, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and power, and glorified be God, the Lord of triumph and dominion, and glorified be God, the Lord of victory and conquest, and glorified be God, the Lord of divine wrath and omnipotence, and glorified be God, the Lord of forgiveness and divine selection, and glorified be God, the Lord of light and illumination, and glorified be God, the Lord of pardon and forgiveness. And unto God belongeth glory and grandeur in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. And unto God belongeth power and exaltation in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Glorious, the Most High. And unto God belongeth might and inaccessibility in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Almighty. And unto God belongeth sovereignty and power in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the One, the All-Luminous. And unto God belongeth triumph and dominion in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the One, the All-Compelling. Say: God is the Creator of all things and verily unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things \[...\]

And verily unto Him do all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and verily unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: God giveth life to all things, and verily unto Him shall all be turned. Say: God causeth all things to die, and verily unto Him shall all be raised. Say: He is the All-Subduing One above His creation, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He is the Manifest One above His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Send down, then, the spirits of those Names which have been sent down in this Tablet from Thy presence upon Thy Name, the One, the Most Exalted, the Unique, that they may aid the Truth from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. And preserve, O my God, all that hath been revealed therein, that it may be present before Him Whom God shall make manifest in homage unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the most powerful of the powerful ones. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily Thou hast sent down the Bayan in truth, wherein are clear signs for all the worlds. Do Thou, then, O my God, send down upon them that preserve Thy words the wonders of Thy grace and bounty. Verily, Thou hast ever been a Magnificent Bestower. Thine is the creation and the command, both before and after, and verily Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful. Thou preservest what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art the Guardian, the Protector. And Thou aidest whom Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art the Helper, the Succourer. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: God aideth those who have believed in God and His signs, and who place their trust in their Lord. Say: The similitude of these verses in the Book is as the similitude of the verses of your hearts within you. These indicate God Who created them, sustained them, caused them to die, gave them life, and exalted them, and they indicate likewise. Say: All shall return unto God. Say: God verily forbiddeth those who have been given the Bayan from burning paper with your hands when anyone writeth unto you or when ye write unto anyone. This is one of God's ordinances; fear ye God, that ye transgress not His bounds. And if ye become wroth, then through God, your Lord, be ye calmed; and if ye become angry, then through God, your Lord, seek ye mercy. Show not aught of your displeasure in writing, for God hath ordained this from His presence. And verily this is the name of an angel in the highest heavens who glorifieth his Lord at all times, before all times and after all times. Grieve not, then, that angel in the highest horizon lest he call upon God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, and God take vengeance thereby upon you while ye know it not. And should anyone write unto you a letter whose contents ye comprehend not, then do ye inquire. Perchance someone intendeth to mention a truth known to him while ye know it not. Then if ye become wroth, calm yourselves through God, unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. Verily there is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The honor of the believer lieth in his letter; look not upon it save with honor from your presence, and read it not save likewise, and answer it with the best ye are able. For among you is He Whom God shall make manifest; perchance ye may not grieve Him. This is one of God's ordinances; watch over yourselves lest ye transgress God's bounds and thereby cause grief to any soul, whereupon ye shall, from whence ye know not, be filled with remorse. Say: Whoso hath observed this in the path of God, God shall grant him the excellence of the life to come \[...\]

And ye shall respond to him with the best of what ye are capable, for verily the One Whom God shall make manifest is among you. Perchance ye may not cause Him grief. This is among the ordinances of God; therefore watch over yourselves, lest ye transgress the bounds set by God and cause grief to a soul whereby, from whence ye know not, ye shall come to regret. Say: Verily he who hath beheld this in the path of God, God shall grant him the excellence of the life to come and the first life by His command. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Most Excellent. And let him who hath acquired this without knowledge seek forgiveness from God his Lord, then let him be among those who are grateful in the religion of God. Say: The most exalted of your deeds in the sight of God is your tranquility in all things; therefore be ye not wrathful save that ye be forbearing. And whoso becometh wrathful in the path of God, then calmeth his heart and showeth patience in what pleaseth his soul - these are they whom God shall grant a double reward in the life to come and the first life, and these are they who shall triumph. Say: Verily We shall remove the grief of him who hath acquired grief from one who witnesseth this in truth and this without knowledge in the Book of God. O people of the Bayan! Ye are all, every one of you, treading the path of your religion and your world for the sake of life and truth, lest any soul be grieved thereby and this return to God while ye know not, for whatsoever returneth to Him Whom God shall make manifest and those who guide unto Him, and who are guided by God your Lord - that returneth unto God. Therefore watch over the bounds of your own selves, for perchance ye may be tested by one who is better for you in the sight of God, yet ye look upon him without the eye of glory, and for this shall ye be called to account before God, your works shall be rendered vain while ye know not. Therefore seek ye forgiveness of God and unto Him shall ye seek forgiveness, and turn ye in repentance unto God and unto Him shall ye return. And God desireth to cause all to enter the paradise from His presence wherein is all that their souls desire - wherein are for you houris like hidden pearls, wherein are for you youths like rubies, wherein is for you whatsoever your souls desire, and God increaseth this for whomsoever He willeth among you. Verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people of the Bayan! Make not yourselves to be among those who transgress the bounds set by God, lest God look upon you on the Day of Resurrection without the eye of love while ye know not. And make not yourselves to be other than companions of paradise, that He Whom God shall make manifest may look upon you with the eye of love, and ye may be among the thankful before God. Say: Verily We shall be observers on the Day of Resurrection - We recognize the companions of the Fire and those who believe not in the signs of God; We recognize the companions of Paradise and those who believe in the signs of God. Say: Verily God hath created in every heart the love of His verses as the best of all things - do ye not desire to hearken, then to behold them, then to acknowledge them? Say: Verily God hath created in every soul the love of Him Whom God shall make manifest \[...\] Is there anyone who loveth not God his Lord? Say: Glory be to God! All glory in the love of God. Say: Verily your remembrance of God your Lord is glory for your souls - will ye not then be grateful?

And they who believe in the verses of God. Say: God hath created in every heart the innate love of His verses; do ye not wish to hearken unto them, then gaze upon them, and then acknowledge them? Say: God hath created within every soul the love of Him Whom God shall make manifest... Is there any who loveth not God, his Lord? Say: Glory be to God! All draw their pride from loving God. Say: Your remembrance of God, your Lord, is a glory unto your souls. Will ye not then be thankful? And if ye remember not God, or if ye do remember Him, it is all one in God's sight. But at such time as ye make mention of this, ye are honored in the sight of God and in the sight of those endowed with knowledge. And verily ye are in the presence of God and in the presence of \[...\]

O ye who have been given knowledge, ye were not among the honored ones. Say: God will verily exalt the verses which have been sent down from His presence, then will He raise them up, then will He cause them to prevail over whomsoever He willeth of His servants. He is, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Say: All are severed through them. Say: All are attracted through them. Say: All through them are brought into the presence of God. Say: All through them prostrate themselves before God. Say: All through them glorify God. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God aideth whom He willeth through His command. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is more knowing than anyone possessed of knowledge. None can escape from the sovereignty of His knowledge, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He hath ever been the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Say: God is more powerful than anyone possessed of power. None can escape from the sovereignty of His might, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He hath ever been the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Say: God verily loveth that ye should submit. Say: They who have been given submission are those who are secure from their tongues and what proceedeth therefrom. These are they who have been given the Bayan, who desire naught save God and who submit to those who love in the path of God, and who, when they hear the truth, respond. How they love! Therefore, abandon not this in the Bayan, that ye may thereby submit to Him Whom God shall make manifest and then receive answer from God. This is of God's bounty unto those possessed of submission and those who show humility in the days of God. Say: In the Paradise of Peace are servants who desire naught save God, and who act for His sake by night and by day. They follow what is revealed from God and show patience for the sake of God, their Lord. Say: God hath a servant in the Supreme Concourse who is mentioned by the name of Peace whenever ye submit. This is from God that he may bear witness unto you, then answer you from His presence that there is no God but Him, the One, the Peace. And unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Most High. Say: God hath created in that Paradise naught but goodly things - will ye not then be thankful? Say: God hath created in that Paradise goodly things the like of which existeth not - will ye not then glorify God and sanctify His praise? Say: God hath created therein maidens like unto hidden pearls whose tresses make mention of Him by night and by day - verily, there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: In that Paradise are youths like unto pieces of ruby who glorify their Lord's praise by night and by day, and who prostrate themselves before Him. They make mention of God from their Lord - there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Holy. Say: He hath created in that Paradise white silk arranged in rows wherein He hath placed such wondrous things as your souls desire, in such wise that God hath purified it from similitudes, that ye may be exalted thereby in the Ridvan.

They are all prostrate before Him, making mention of God from the presence of their Lord. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Holy One. Say: He hath created in that Garden couches of pure silk arranged in rows, wherein He placeth such wondrous things as your souls have desired, in such wise that God hath purified it from all similitude, and therein ye shall be exalted in paradise. And say: Praise be to God Who hath caused us to enter the abode of peace from His presence; verily we were submissive unto Him. We shall glorify our Lord, the All-Merciful, with praise and shall be among the thankful. And say: Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.And say: Praise be to God, there is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. And unto Him are four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Protective, the Most Protective. There is no God but Him, the Most Protective, the Most Protective. Say: God is more protective than any protector. None can withstand the sovereign might of His protection, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Protecting, the Preserver, the Guardian.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are submissive unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily He shall protect whomsoever He willeth among His servants through His angels of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily He hath ever been the All-Protecting, the Preserver, the Guardian. Say: Who besides God is able to protect you? Will ye not then be thankful? Say: Who besides God is able to help you? Will ye not then be thankful? Say: Verily God helpeth whom He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Helper, the Succourer, the One Who aideth. Say: He exalteth whom He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Protecting, the Preserver, the Guardian.Glory be unto Thee, O God, my Lord! Thou hast protected me from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end through Thy protection. Verily Thou hast ever been a Guardian. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Unto Thee be majesty for having protected me with a mighty protection. Glory be unto Thee, O God, my Lord! Unto Thee be praise for having protected me with an exalted protection. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Unto Thee be grandeur for having protected me. Verily Thou hast ever been possessed of true and mighty grandeur.Say: Whether at eventide or at dawn, ye shall surely recite the first verse that is before you.

And between them, verily He hath ever been the All-Protecting, the All-Preserving, the All-Guarding. Say: Who other than God can protect you? Will ye not then be thankful? Say: Who other than God can aid you? Will ye not then render thanks? Say: Verily God aideth whom He willeth through His command. He hath ever been the Helper, the Succourer, the One Who rendereth victorious. Say: He exalteth whom He willeth through His command. He hath ever been the All-Protecting, the All-Preserving, the All-Guarding.Glorified art Thou, O my God! My Lord! Thou hast verily protected me from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end through Thy protection. Verily Thou hast ever been the All-Guarding. Glorified art Thou, O my God! Unto Thee be glory for having protected me with magnificent glory. Glorified art Thou, O my God, my Lord! Unto Thee be praise for having protected me with exalted praise. Glorified art Thou, O my God! Unto Thee be grandeur for having protected me. Verily Thou hast ever been possessed of magnificent and true grandeur.Say: When ye enter upon the evening or the morning, ye shall verily recite the first verse before you and behind you and above your heads and on your right and your left and beneath your feet and from every direction that extendeth unto you. These are seven complete, the number of the Gates of Certitude, and the letters of Ali-before-Muhammad, and the days of your week, and the degrees of your origination, and the seas of your glory, and the stars of your sanctity. Through God's command ye shall attain unto all good.Say: We are all protected by God. Say: We are preserved within God's sanctuary. Say: We are guarded within God's mystery. Say: We are sheltered within God's fortress. Say: We are protected within God's might. Say: We are preserved within God's majesty. Say: We are guarded within God's mercy. Say: We are protected within God's sovereignty. Say: We are preserved within God's riches. Say: We are guarded within God's grandeur. Say: We are protected within God's light. Say: We are preserved within God's verses. Say: We are guarded within God's dominion. Say: We are protected within God's good-pleasure. Say: We are preserved within God's kingdom.Say: Verily God protecteth us before us and behind us and on our right and on our left and above our heads and beneath our feet and from every direction that pertaineth unto us through the angels of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. Verily He hath power over all things. This is through God's bounty unto us. Verily He is the Preserver of all things.Say: Who other than God can preserve the verses of your hearts and your spirits and your souls and your bodies? Will ye not then see? Say: Who can preserve the measures of what hath been sent down from God in the Book save those who have been given knowledge from God and who are assured through God's command? Say: Verily God will preserve all that hath been revealed from the Point of the Bayan through the angels of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them, even were it but the measure of a point. Verily He is the Preserver of all things. And likewise that which hath been revealed unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: That is greater than this.

Say: And likewise hath been revealed concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: That is greater than this. And ye shall preserve the traces of God according to your capacity. Say: Had not the Book of God been preserved aforetime upon the leaves of trees, how would ye today be reading from gilded tablets? Therefore preserve ye all that hath been revealed in the Bayan, for this is sustenance unto all the worlds. Then preserve ye all that hath been revealed from God according to your capacity. Say: God sufficeth me, both in the past and in the future, that He may preserve by His command. God sufficeth as a Preserver and Guardian. God sufficeth as a Helper and Succourer. God sufficeth as One Who is Manifest and as a Support. God sufficeth as One Who is All-Knowing and Omniscient. God sufficeth as a Judge and One Who is All-Wise.O ye who are endowed with knowledge! Preserve ye all that hath been revealed from the Point of the Bayan more carefully than your own eyes, nay, more carefully than the verses of your hearts, for these are established through the verses of God. Will ye not preserve them? Say: Yea, we all, by God, are preservers.Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the exaltation of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the Most Beautiful Preserver. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the stronghold of Thy grandeur. Verily, Thou art the Most Beautiful Preserver. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the loftiness of Thy Self-Subsistence. Verily, Thou art the Most Great Preserver. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the radiance of Thy countenance. Verily, Thou art the Most Beautiful Preserver. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the might of Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Most Beautiful Preserver. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord my God! Preserve Thou Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the summit of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the Most Beautiful Preserver.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Preserving, the Most Preserving!Glory be to Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Glory and the Might, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Ruby, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Face and the Beauty, Thine the Grandeur and the Perfection, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Authority and the Justice, Thine the Likeness and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Exaltation, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Pride and the Sublimity, Thine the Glory and the Inaccessibility, Thine the Power and the Transcendence, Thine the Bounties and the Favors, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and creation, of sovereignty and power, of triumph and victory, of manifestation and revelation, of light and radiance, of might and glory - whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and creation, of Thy generosity and grace, Thy gift and kindness, Thy favor and munificence, Thy loftiness and beneficence, Thy transcendence and bestowal, and that which pertaineth to Thy names \[...\]

All praise be unto Thee for that which befitteth Thy station and Thy Names and attributes, and thanksgiving be unto Thee in a manner worthy of the sublimity of Thy glory, and none else. I render thanks for how Thou hast preserved me and all that pertaineth unto me from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end through Thy protection, Thy guardianship, Thy preservation, Thy sheltering care, Thy triumph, Thy sovereignty, Thy might, Thy power, Thy greatness, Thy self-subsistence, Thy loftiness, Thy perpetuity, Thy eternity, Thy beloved nature, Thy radiance, Thy exaltation, Thy good-pleasure, Thy names, Thy splendor, and all that Thou art in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Whomsoever Thou preservest shall not be lost, whomsoever Thou aidest shall not be forsaken, whomsoever Thou exaltest shall not be abased, whomsoever Thou strengthenest shall not be weakened, whomsoever Thou empowerest shall lean upon no pillar save Thee, and whomsoever Thou raisest up shall look to none other than Thee.Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for the wonders of Thy preservation, the tokens of Thy protection, the dawning-places of Thy guardianship, the daysprings of Thy sheltering care, and the manifestations of Thy watchful eye. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Independent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted, Supreme, Mighty, and All-Powerful. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hast Thou any partner in Thy creation or any associate in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life, and Thou dost preserve all things howsoever Thou willest, wheresoever Thou willest, and whensoever Thou willest, save him who entereth not into the Bayan and seeketh to veil himself from the sublimity of Thy remembrance in the Furqan.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! Glorified and magnified art Thou! Glorified and honored art Thou! Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Preserving, the Most Preserving. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent things, raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existing things, made Himself victorious in His triumph above all atoms, made Himself mighty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, made Himself well-pleased in His good-pleasure above all who dwell in the kingdom of similitudes and allusions, and made Himself glorious in His glory above all who dwell in the kingdom of remembrance and evidences. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but He, the Single, the All-Preserving. Then He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that the Seven Letters are the guardian of His mystery, the repository of His hidden knowledge, and the treasury of His wisdom.

In the name of God, the All-Preserving, the Most Preserving! And He is the repository of His knowledge, the key to His wisdom, and the lamps of His guidance, whereby God hath filled His heaven and His earth. He, verily, is none other than He. This is the first embroidery that hath been embroidered, the first that hath been adorned, the first essence that hath been manifested, the first abstraction that hath been made abstract, the first radiance that hath radiated, the first dawning that hath dawned, the first rising that hath risen, and the first manifestation that hath been manifested. Through Him hath been renewed the creation of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Through Him hath God revealed what was hidden in the mystery of the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them. How preserving is He of God's Cause and His signs! How mighty is He in the sight of God and His loved ones! How exalted is He in the Book in the kingdom of Command and Creation, then before His witnesses! Wherefore, praise be to God for the perfection of His preservation and the symmetry of His handiwork - praise resplendent, radiant, sanctified and gleaming, transcending the praise of all who praise and rising above the heights of the worlds - praise that hath no likeness in His knowledge, no peer in His Book, no equal in His earth, no similitude in His heaven, and no parallel in the kingdom of His Command and Creation - praise that God loveth and with which He is well-pleased through the bounty of His Lord and the gifts of His Creator. Verily, there is no God but He, the Overseer, the Self-Subsisting.The fourth in the fourth, in the name of God, the Most Preserving, the All-Preserving! Verily, all glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen except the Primal Unity. And furthermore, I testify that God, exalted and glorified be He, preserveth the heaven lest it fall upon the earth, and preserveth the earth above the water, and preserveth all things in their orbits save what descendeth to the nethermost earth through means He hath created and manifestations He hath originated. Therefore, preserve what thou willest in the Book and thank God for having created paper, for every knowledge that is not recorded therein is effaced. And make thou the means of preservation for all things those instrumentalities which have been created by God's command. Yet look not unto them, but rather unto Him Who created them and preserveth them. For God, verily, preserveth all things as He willeth, through what He willeth, by His angels of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. He, verily, is the Preserver of all things.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the name of God, the Most Thankful, the All-Thankful! There is no God but He, the Most Thankful, the All-Thankful. Say: God is more thankful than anyone possessed of thankfulness. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His thankful sovereignty, whether in the heavens or in the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath been thankful, grateful, appreciative. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the sovereignty \[...\]

Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the heavenly realm, then the strength and the crystal realm, then the dominion and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who fadeth not, and the Just One Who deviateth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One Who letteth nothing escape His grasp, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Glorified is He unto Whom offer thanks all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore render ye thanks unto God Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life. For none besides God is worthy of this except him whom God permitteth by His command. Verily He is the All-Thankful, the All-Subtle. Say: Should the essence of unity appear in your hearts, ye would assuredly connect this with all that your knowledge encompasseth of the bounds of your hidden and manifest selves, your outer and inner beings, your seats and your assemblies, and whatsoever ye possess by His leave. Ye should cause the essence of the Cause to flow through all things, that ye may ascend unto the Ridvan of the Bayan in spirit and delight. And lest He Whom God shall make manifest should witness in His dominion that which He loveth not from you who, from the beginning of your lives unto the end, move within God's kingdom. Therefore act in such wise that ye may respond to Him, and should He testify concerning you, possessors of exalted might would surely affirm this. There is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Beloved. Say: From the beginning of your lives until ye are taken, ye move within God's kingdom. And should ye render what ye possess in accordance with what your souls love, no one would witness any grief. This is of God's bounty unto you, that ye may be thankful. Say: God loveth that all that is on earth be rendered according to what is possible in all things, that ye may thereby give thanks in the Ridvan of the Bayan. Say: When the potentiality of each thing reacheth its highest manifestation, then verily it hath entered the Ridvan of its Lord. Therefore ye must give thanks. Give thanks unto those in authority from God, for He hath permitted this unto you, that ye may love one another and not be proud. Say: Whoso giveth thanks from a soul that hath believed in God and His verses and hath accepted what was revealed in the Bayan - how doth such a one render thanks unto God, his Lord? O all things! In all things ye give thanks, but ye give thanks to none save Him Who created all things. This is of God's bounty unto all things, that ye may abide in God's kingdom in spirit and delight. Say: Should ye possess that which ye love, then ye would be delighted thereby, but should ye possess what is detestable, then ye would be grieved in your souls. Therefore look unto that which bringeth glory to your souls, if ye be of them that look in the Ridvan of the Bayan. Possess not that which ye love not.

Say: If you possess something you love, behold how delighted you become; but if you possess what is disliked, you yourselves become saddened thereby. Therefore consider that which leads to your exaltation, if you be of them that observe in the paradise of the Bayan. Possess not that which you yourselves do not love, but exchange it for that which you do love, even if it be but a sheet of paper, if you are able. Say: Examine all things minutely, lest you be veiled from the particular and heed it not, thus entering into sorrow. If you observe every universal, you observe every particular - their Lord is the Lord of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. He desires to raise each particular and universal to a horizon beyond which there is no higher, that they may give thanks unto God, their Lord - those servants who rejoice in Him. This is what God has enjoined upon you in the Bayan, that perchance on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, all your possessions and what you own may be like precious olive oil, which you must preserve that all peoples may enter your Faith through love thereof, and all may flow in God's good-pleasure. Say: I give thanks unto God, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all things, Lord of all the worlds, for all that He has created and will create. Verily there is no God but Him, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. Say: All praise belongs to God as your thanksgiving unto Him. Invent not from yourselves different expressions which people then follow in your knowledge. We have indeed known what has been composed in the science of meanings and what has been composed regarding praise and thanksgiving. Say: All this but proves that the Qur'an in itself has extensive power which all are powerless before. Yet on the Day of the Fruit We witnessed that you comprehended naught save counted words devoid of spirit, nor did you attain unto what God intended. Had you learned that knowledge, you would testify that the verses are from God. How then, when you hear them, does your knowledge not benefit you? Thus have you veiled yourselves from God your Lord. Were it not for what you have learned, perchance you might be guided. Invent not expressions among yourselves to exalt some above others without right while you know not. Say: You have called yourselves learned ones, then invented distinctions between praise and thanksgiving while knowing not their mystery nor what God intended thereby, and little do you remember. God created praise that you might praise before His presence on the day of His manifestation, and created thanksgiving that when you hear of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest you might give thanks. Yet from the beginning of your lives until their end you praise and thank God while neither your praise nor thanks reach unto God, for they reach not unto His Proof. Yea, if you convey your praise and thanks unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, then shall you be rewarded thereby. This is what reaches unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, whether you understand its meaning or not. Say: Were God to make the seas of the heavens \[...\]

Praise ye Him Whom God shall make manifest, for through Him shall ye be rewarded. This is what leadeth unto God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, whether ye comprehend its meaning or comprehend it not. Say: Were God to make all the oceans of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them the meaning of a single Ha of 'Hamd' and 'Shukr', all these would be exhausted before their meaning could be fathomed. How then dare ye speak in the Book of God, except that ye acknowledge your powerlessness? Moreover, on the Day of God's Manifestation, ye shall witness your powerlessness before Him Whom God shall make manifest, and in this shall ye glory. Say: He Who revealed the Bayan knoweth its beginning and its end. This knowledge belongeth to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and besides Him none knoweth save what He hath taught them. Fear ye God, that ye may enquire concerning its beginning and its end only that which God hath intended. Say: Should all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them gather together to produce one letter like unto that which hath been revealed in the Bayan, they would never be able, nor would they have the power. How then could they comprehend the knowledge of its meaning, or the mystery of its beginning and its end, or that which the knowledge of God hath encompassed therein? Say: Glorified be He far above this, with an exaltation that is great! None knoweth the interpretation of what hath been revealed in the Bayan except God and those who have been given knowledge from God, not those who have acquired knowledge from creation, for they comprehend not that which God hath revealed therein. Say: Knowledge other than that which encompasseth the good-pleasure of God profiteth not, for all peoples possess knowledge of their religion and worldly affairs - how can this benefit them even to the extent of a mustard seed? Make ye your knowledge to be of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then of His good-pleasure, then of all things - thereby shall ye be independent.O My God! I testify, and all things testify, that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Sovereignty, Thine the Power and the Divine Realm, Thine the Strength and the Glory, Thine the Dominion and the earthly realm, Thine the Majesty and Grandeur, Thine the Countenance and Beauty, Thine the Face and Perfection, Thine the Mercy and Bounty, Thine the Authority and Justice, Thine the Similitude and Examples, Thine the Stations and Sublimity, Thine the Greatness and Independence, Thine the Awe and Majesty, Thine the Glory and Invincibility, Thine the Power and Exaltation, Thine the Joy and Gladness, Thine the Province and Detachment, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Sanctified, Everlasting, Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things by Thy power and ordained them by measure, and formed all things by Thy will and fashioned them completely. Unto Thee be praise, O my God, with such praise as none save Thee deserveth.

All praise be unto Thee, O my God - praise that none except Thee deserveth; and all thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my Beloved - thanksgiving that none but Thee befitteth. I praise Thee with true praise in all things, for Thou hast created all things that they might praise Thee before the Manifestation of Thyself. Therefore, O my God, I shall reap the fruit for which Thou hast created all things, and I shall praise Thee with praise that filleth Thy names and Thy earth and whatsoever lieth between them from the kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Verily there is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.I shall thank Thee, O Lord, for having created all things, and for creating from all things that which Thou hast encompassed in Thy knowledge. For Thou hast created naught save that it might render thanks before the Manifestation of Thyself. Therefore, O my God, I shall thank Thee through my self, by my self, before Thy Self, and I shall praise Thee through my essence, by my essence, before the Dawning-Places of Thy Cause. I shall call upon Thee in the secret of my soul, for Thou hast encompassed all things in knowledge. I shall manifest all Thy praise and all Thy glory in whatsoever is therein and thereupon, for unto Thee belongeth thanksgiving from before and after. Never hast Thou ceased, nor wilt Thou ever cease, to be thanked by him who thanketh Thee before Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest in the days of His appearance, and unto Thee be praise, O my God, true praise by him who praiseth Thee through the manifestation of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in the days of His concealment.Thou hast created all things in the form of Thy love. How wondrous and exalted is praise in Thy kingdom! How holy and sublime! It belongeth to Thee alone, there is no God but Thee, that all should worship Thee, prostrate themselves before Thee, praise Thee, sanctify Thee, glorify Thee and exalt Thee. How glorious and majestic is thanksgiving in Thy kingdom! How beautiful and magnificent! How radiant and holy! Who can comprehend the knowledge of Thy praise or the reality of Thy thanksgiving? For true thanksgiving belongeth to Him Whom God shall make manifest, as all else belongeth to Him, and it is Thine alone, there is no God but Thee.O God! Create servants in the Bayan who will thank Thee in the day of His manifestation through His manifestation, and praise Thee in the day of His advent through His concealment. For I have not witnessed among the people of Islam a goodly upbringing that would manifest Thy love, though the people of Islam are countless and all await the appearance of Thy Proof, weeping and supplicating throughout long nights. Yet when We caused them to hear mention of Thy manifestation in My manifestation, I witnessed no servants who would praise Thee or worship Thee or thank Thee, although all Thy creation, by night and by day, unknowingly praise and thank Thee. Therefore, O God, raise up the people of the Bayan with a goodly upbringing that their praise and thanksgiving may benefit them and not be lost. Through my praise of Thee in my manifestation and my thanksgiving to Thee in my dawning, I shall be independent of the praise and thanksgiving of all things, should there appear before anyone his praise and thanksgiving upon the appearance of His proof, and that is His glory.

That is His glory and honor. But I have cut myself off from Thy creation and become independent of Thy servants, for I see not in them the spirit of insight or the secret of truth, praising in heights that benefit them not, or giving thanks in horizons that bring them no love. For Thou didst say - and Thy word is the truth - "If ye give thanks unto Me, I will give thanks unto you." By Thy might! Were all things to thank Thee in the presence of Thy proof through faith in Him, Thou wouldst surely thank them for what Thou hast revealed in Thy verses. Yet I have not comprehended this knowledge, nor witnessed it intensely in these days. Glorified art Thou! Glorified art Thou! He whom Thou didst exalt throughout the ages - when Thou didst manifest Him, they thanked Him not, nor praised Him with Thy thanks and praise, save what I am ashamed to mention. Indeed, two letters have come before me from the name of Muhammad and Ali - one from the land of Ta and one from the land of Za - wherein they gave thanks for the manifestation of Thy proof. Beyond these two, if they thank Thee, it is in their secret hearts. I judge no one except by what Thou hast ordained as paths and revealed as stations. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I am of those who give thanks.The Third in the Third:In the Name of God, the Most Thankful, the Most Thankful! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His transcendence above all contingent beings, Who hath made His good-pleasure to excel above all created things, Who hath demonstrated His dominion over all existence, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all atoms, and Who hath proven His invincibility above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. I bear witness, and all creation with me, that there is no God but Him, the One \[...\] Then I call Him to witness \[...\] His creation to what hath appeared as the Sun of His Reality, manifested as the Moon of His Authority, shone forth as the Stars of the heaven of His Power, made evident as the Pathways of His Lordly might, and raised up as the Measures of His holy Oneness.

None has offered thanks as anyone before Him hath rendered thanks, for were God not to manifest anyone, how would creation worship God their Creator, or become aware of the good-pleasure of their Fashioner, or renew within themselves the degrees of their paradise, or comprehend aught of the measures of His holiness and what hath been sent down from His presence - hallowed and exalted be He above what those who extinguish His light may praise Him for. All praise God in the unseen. Glorified be God above what they may thank Him for. All thank God in the unseen. However, the thanks and praise that reach unto God from all things are what appear before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore be vigilant on that Day, if ye be among those who praise Him.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Thankful, the Most Thankful. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Thankful, the Most Thankful. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein none can be seen except the First Unity. I testify that praise was created for God, and all that whereby thou thanked or praised God thy Lord shall cause His signs and bounties to increase upon thee. But if thou art able to bring this to fruition, then thank God during the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest through what reacheth unto Him, and praise God thy Lord at His dawning through what reacheth unto Him. For other than this shall not profit thee on the Day of Resurrection. Throughout the night praise God as much as thou art able, that perchance through this habitual practice thou mayest thank God on the day of His Manifestation and praise God at such time as He maketh Himself known unto thee, that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.And He hath four ranks. The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Harmful, the Most Harmful. There is no God but He, the Most Harmful, the Most Harmful. Say: God is more harmful than any possessor of harm. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His harmful sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been harmful, injurious, and destructive. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who perisheth not, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth \[...\]

Say: God will indeed benefit you - will ye not then be thankful? Say: God will indeed harm you - will ye not then be God-fearing? Consider what God hath prescribed for you concerning pilgrimage, and how ye spend in the path of God. Thus doth God do what He pleaseth and ordain what He willeth. Say: None but Him Whom God shall make manifest can either harm or benefit you. Therefore hold fast to the Most Great Handle which cannot be broken, that ye may prosper on the Day of Resurrection. Be assured concerning Him when He maketh Himself known unto you, then be ye ever thankful. And if your hearts be not at peace with Him, make yourselves like unto those who were given the Book before you, whom ye now observe - how when the Truth came to them from God, their vain imaginings veiled them from God their Lord. Unto God belong greatness and majesty in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belong might and power in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: None but God can harm you, and none but God can benefit you, and none but God can exalt you, and none but God can abase you, and none but God can aid you, and none but God can abandon you - will ye not then see? Fear ye God through His Manifestation, then fear ye Him. Say: Were He to ordain for all who are on earth a measure of gold each hour, could ye compute it? This is God's command - who can resist His sovereignty in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them, if ye but knew? And were He to withhold this from you, could ye reckon the benefit that cometh from God through His Manifestation? How is it ye see not? Say: Verily the offices of your religion and your world lie within the grasp of Him Whom God shall make manifest - will ye not then consider? Say: These lie within God's grasp, Who created you and sustaineth you and causeth you to die and to live again. Is there any creator besides God who could do this unto you? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! All that He hath created and will create glorify Him. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them by His command, if ye but knew? Say: God Who created all things by His command is nearer than "Be and it is." Such is God your Lord - His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Unto God belongeth all that is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower of bounties, the Most Bountiful. Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and God is the All-Loving, the Lover, the Beloved.

By God, the Beloved is loving and loved! Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. God is the Possessor, Owner and King. Unto God belongeth the everlasting sovereignty of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. God is the Eternal, Everlasting, and Ever-Abiding One.Say: In His grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: In His hand is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.Say: By God's command do ye appear. Say: God is my Lord and the Lord of our forefathers. Say: God is my Lord and the Lord of our mothers who have gone before. Say: God is my Lord and the Lord of our manifest brethren. Say: God is my Lord and the Lord of our hidden sisters. Say: God is my Lord and the Lord of all that hath been created and shall be created. There is none other God but Him, the Great, the Most Exalted.Glorified be He Who, by His command, bestoweth benefit upon all who are in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Unto Him shall all return. And praise be to God Who, by His command, causeth harm to those in the kingdom of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. Will ye not fear?Say: It behooveth not to attribute to God the measures that appear from the Sun of Truth, while ye, by day and by night, through their means, acquire that from which ye derive benefit or harm. This is what God hath ordained through Him Whom He shall make manifest, according to what hath been decreed in the Book, while ye circle round the Cause of God and are empowered by what God hath ordained.Say: God will teach you in the Book a benefit the like of which ye cannot find in the knowledge of God. Will ye not profit thereby? Say: This is your faith in God, then in Him Whom He shall manifest, then in what appeareth from Him. Will ye not benefit? For if ye were to acquire all things but not this, it would not profit you; but if ye possessed naught yet acquired this, God would cause you to benefit from all things. Will ye not be thankful?Say: God will teach you of a harm the like of which existeth not in His knowledge, that ye may guard yourselves. This is your veiling of Him Whom God shall make manifest. This confirmeth your veiling from God, your Lord, then from Our holy measures from His presence. Though ye might benefit from all things, it shall harm you. Therefore have mercy upon yourselves and be merciful, for in your life there is no benefit for you save to be enriched. After being veiled from this, ye deserve naught else, and though ye acquire every benefit, it would not be considered valid before God. Therefore watch over yourselves and worship God, your Lord.However, if ye believe in God and in what hath been revealed in the Bayan, ye will truly deserve all good, and ye shall witness that no harm existeth before God, and it will not harm you, and in your life ye shall benefit, then after your death ye shall enter the Most Great Paradise, and therein shall ye glorify \[...\]

In your earthly lives you shall bring forth benefit, and after your passing you shall enter into the Most Great Paradise, and therein shall you glorify Him.The Second in the Second: In the Name of God, the Most Harmful, the Most Harmful.Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and the sovereignty, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the symbol and the symbols, Thine the station and the grandeur, Thine the greatness and the independence, Thine the awe and the revelation, Thine the glory and the invincibility, Thine the power and the exaltation, Thine the joy and the gladness, Thine the sovereignty and the dominion.Thou hast ever been the Harmer of tyrants and the Benefactor of the righteous. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Everlasting, Inaccessible, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in sovereignty nor any protector on earth save by Thy leave. Thou hast created all things by Thy power.Therefore shall I magnify Thee, O my God, with supreme magnification, and glorify Thee, O my Lord, with mighty glorification, and sanctify Thee, O my Creator, with great sanctification, and exalt Thee, O my Maker, with tremendous exaltation, and honor Thee, O my Fashioner, with mighty honor.I find none like unto Thee in harm, for I have witnessed in Thy decrees that Thou hast ordained that none shall benefit who entereth not the Bayan. Glory be unto Thee! How mighty art Thou in harm, how exalted in power, how sovereign in dominion, how great in bounty, how manifest in appearance!And I have seen none like unto Thee in benefit, for Thou hast permitted all that Thou hast created for those who have believed in Thee and in Thy verses in the Bayan. How bountiful art Thou, O my God, and how generous! How beneficent art Thou, O my Beloved, and how giving! How kind art Thou, O my Desired One, and how loving!Nay, by Thy might! I know of no harmer like unto Thee, and I witness no benefactor besides Thee. When Thou revealest what Thou hast ordained, all souls shall testify that Thou art the Harmer, none can resist Thy Cause, and that Thou art the Benefactor, none can bestow benefit like unto Thee.Glorified and exalted art Thou! These are the limits of oneness in Thy kingdom, and if Thou desirest the limits of faith - whoso seeketh not Thee, Thou harmeth him such that it is as if he had never worshipped Thee from the beginning of his life to its end; and whoso confirmeth Thee, Thou benefiteth him by exalting him after none had known him, though all Thy creation knew the First One.Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Thou art the Harmer in truth and the Benefactor in truth. None shall benefit in his worldly life or his religion on the day of Thy manifestation save he who cometh unto the Manifestation of Thy Self with faith in Thee, attesting that there is no God but Thee and that Thy proof hath been perfected from Thy presence.

By Thy proof hath been perfected from Thy presence, and His call hath reached all Thy creation, and through Him have been detailed the measures of all that pleaseth Thee. Therefore, when such a one hath sought Thy protection from the name of harmfulness in his religion and his world, and hath entered through Thy bounty into the ocean of beneficence in his religion and his world before Thee, O my God, I too shall surely seek protection from all that harmeth me. Therefore, O God, preserve me and those who have entered the Bayan, by Thy glory, Thy majesty, Thy beauty, Thy grandeur, Thy light, Thy mercy, Thy words, Thy names, Thy might, Thy knowledge, Thy power, Thy utterance, Thy honor, Thy sovereignty, Thy dominion, Thy loftiness, Thy bounty, and Thy signs. For verily Thou art the One with power over what Thou willest and mighty over what Thou desirest. Cause me to enter, O my God, into the ocean of Thy beneficence, that I may move in Thy path within the bounds of religion and the conditions of beneficence with such benefit as Thou hast not given the like thereof to anyone, nor bestowed its semblance upon any soul in the kingdom of what hath been and shall be created, from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end. Verily, Thou hast ever been the All-Beneficent, the Mighty, the Great.The Third of the Third - In the Name of God, Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent things, Who hath manifested His dominion above all existing things, Who hath revealed His triumph above all created things, Who hath shown His victory above all who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes, and Who hath demonstrated His power above all atoms. I testify, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Harmful - a testimony purified from the doubt of conjunction and the limitations of veiling, for His harm is like His benefit. He hath ever been praised in all excellence and beloved in the kingdom of origin and similitude. He hath created all things from nothing by His power, and hath shown the path of His good-pleasure in the measures of the benefit of His Lordship, and the path of His harm in that which followeth not the good-pleasure of the sovereignty of His oneness.The first harm that hath been ordained is for him who believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest - the elevation of His presence and what He hath been given. For when one entertaineth in his heart aught but faith, he deserveth not to benefit, much less to possess His glory - this in the first life and in the life of fire, as long as the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them endure, except what God willeth through His bounty. I seek protection from His harm, for nothing can withstand it. I testify, and all His creation beareth witness, that the Seven Letters are His servant and His proof, and what hath been revealed in the Bayan concerning the measures of all things are the keys to His bounty and generosity, and the fountains of His grace and mercy. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. From the summit of harm flow forth the oceans of benefit. Verily, there is no God but Him, the One, the Harmful.The Fourth of the Fourth - In the Name of God, the Most Harmful, the Most Harmful. Praise be to God, Who is no God but Him, the Most Harmful, the Most Harmful. And verily the glory be upon the First Unity and upon them who resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity.

And who resembles that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. Then bear thou witness that there is no harmer save God and no benefiter besides Him. This hath not been made manifest except from the Sun of Truth in all its manifestations and in its concealment, according to what hath been ordained in its manifestation. If He Whom God shall make manifest benefiteth thee, render thanks unto God thy Lord, for verily He is the Supreme Benefiter. And if He Whom God shall make manifest harmeth thee, praise God thy Lord, for verily He is the Supreme Harmer. Let not His harm veil thee from His benefit, for both proceed from Him and are praiseworthy. But watch over thyself when He willeth to benefit all things, for to harm is justice and to benefit is grace. Say: All is from God and all are created before Him. And He hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Taker, the Taker. There is no God but He, the Taker, the Taker. Say: God is the Supreme Taker above all possessors of refuge. None can escape from the dominion of His taking power, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Taking, the Most Taking, the All-Seized. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God shall destroy those who enter not the Bayan by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: Verily God shall seize with a grievous seizing those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Verily God shall banish those who enter not themselves among the steadfast ones. Verily He hath ever been the Preserver of all things. Say: Verily God shall distinguish between all His servants at every Resurrection. Will ye not \[...\]

Fear ye God! Enter ye, then, into that which God hath ordained for you in every Dispensation, and be not veiled from God by that which ye acquired in your former manifestations. Pronounce that Name upon those who believe not in God, your Lord, and who follow not what hath been sent down in the Bayan, if ye desire to behold them abased beneath your feet. Say: God shall, verily, seize with a severe seizing those who have not believed in God and His signs. He, verily, is a Mighty Seizer, seizing with might. Say: If ye seize those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, then in the fire shall ye find no patience. When your hearts incline toward those Names, they shall love you and aid you and exalt you and grant you your rewards in your return and your abode. God is with the doers of good who do good in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and who believe in God and His signs.O people of the Bayan! Ye observe in the Qur'an how those who were given the Qur'an took the commands of their Lord in His Book, while they remained far removed from what God had desired therein. Read ye the Qur'an from beginning to end; little shall ye witness therein concerning commands and prohibitions. And all that was revealed therein was that ye might believe in God and be assured of His signs. How is it that ye have taken your ordinances and veiled yourselves from all that was revealed in the Qur'an from beginning to end - a command from God that ye should be assured of God and His signs? Soon shall ye take your ordinances, and God shall manifest the Manifestation of His Self, while ye remain veiled from the purpose of God.Say: The purpose of God therein is that ye should believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and be assured of His signs. Say: The commands of God are for the exaltation of the Manifestation of His Self - can ye not see? Say: The prohibitions of God are for the protection of the Manifestation of His Essence - will ye not consider? How is it that ye have taken your ordinances while remaining veiled from what God hath desired therein? All this is for the exaltation of Him Whom God shall make manifest and His protection. Therefore fear God, lest ye be veiled from Him by your ordinances while ye perceive not.Verily God hath created you and all things through the Manifestation of His Self, that ye might be guided by Him on the Day of Resurrection. Reflect ye a little, then look into the essence of wisdom. For all do work for God according to their own selves and make supplication unto Him, but God beareth witness to those who fear Him in His path and who believe in the meeting with His Proof. These are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and these are they who are assured of the command of God from His presence. Were anyone to offer them all that is on earth, it would not turn them aside from the path of God, and they supplicate Him night and day. These are they whom God hath created for His Cause, and these are the chosen ones.If ye follow Him Whom God shall make manifest, then have ye followed the ordinances of your religion; otherwise your religious ordinances and their components shall profit you not. All hath been created for the exaltation of God's Cause - and what cause is greater than Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye but knew? Take ye your name; if ye be not assured of it, ye shall be guided to understand how God will seize thereby \[...\] and take all that veils you from God, your Lord, before the angels of divine capture take you.

And is there any greater matter than Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye did but know! Take ye your name; and if ye believe not therein, ye shall come to know the way God hath taken it.... Take ye all that behooveth you from God, your Lord, ere the angels of divine chastisement seize you while ye are unaware. And take ye those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, who, when they hear mention of Him, arise not, nor present themselves before Him, nor prostrate themselves as ye are able. For these are the companions of the fire who shall seize them, and the companions of paradise - verily He hath power over all things.Say: Those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and who, by His leave, enter the House of Truth - these are they who shall enter upon the fragrance of paradise, and these are they who shall triumph before God. And those who enter into the house of one who believeth not in Him - these are they who enter into the fire, and these are they who shall not be helped therein.And if ye desire to aid the Cause of God, God hath indeed given you permission. Enter ye their dwellings and set aright the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest, insofar as ye are able. Say: Their likeness is as the likeness of those who were promised Muhammad, the Apostle of God; yet when He came unto them, they believed not in Him. Again, their likeness is as the likeness of those who were promised Muhammad, their Proof; yet when God made Him manifest with clear signs from His presence, they believed not in Him.Watch over yourselves, O people of the Bayan, lest ye become like unto them. For when ye are veiled, God will take you to task for your veiling of yourselves. Have mercy, therefore, on your own selves, then return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest in truth, and prostrate yourselves, and by His leave possess all that is on earth. For all that is on earth belongeth unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. God hath not made lawful unto anyone so much as a grain of mustard seed save by His leave, even were it nine times nineteen measures of mustard seed. For this hath been created for Him, and He is not pleased that any should possess it save by leave of his Lord.Therefore seek ye to possess all things by leave of God through the Manifestation of His Self, if ye desire to possess in truth. Otherwise He will not desire to make mention of you. And how many are the servants who possess without right that which they possess! God shall soon seize them and purify the earth of such as believe not in God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. And He shall cause all to enter the religion of the Bayan. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Taker, the TakerGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the dominion and the realm. Thou givest life and death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, neither in the heavens \[...\]

Verily naught escapeth Thy grasp, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst whatsoever Thou willest by Thy command. Thou, verily, hast power over all things. I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art the Most Powerful of the powerful, the Most Mighty of the mighty, the Most Compelling of compellers, the Most Subduing of subduers, and the Most Sovereign of sovereigns. Thou hast ordained for Thyself in every Revelation that Thou wilt seize him who believeth not in Thee and in Thy signs. Therefore, O my God, hasten the manifestations of these Names and the dawning-places of these proofs, for verily whosoever taketh aught from anyone, that taking is Thy taking, and it is not established as Thine except it be for Thy Cause and be like unto the manifestations of Thy compelling power, Thy subduing might, Thy overwhelming force, and Thy sovereign authority. Preserve then, O my God, for him whom Thou shalt make manifest from these proofs the most separated, the most manifest, the most enduring, the most established and the most prevailing, that the heart of him whom Thou shalt make manifest may be at peace concerning those who are veiled from him on the day of his manifestation, after having worshipped Thee from the beginning of their lives unto the end thereof. Do Thou, O my God, send forth the Most Mighty among the mighty compellers, for verily I intended by all the manifestations of the Names - whether of might or sovereignty or the like thereof - naught save Names that in such instances indicate none but Thee, and that transcend every attribute of Thy creation and every designation of Thy servants. Never have the Manifestations of Thy Names ceased to be evident above all contingent things, and the Dawning-Places of Thy proofs to be supreme and inaccessible above all created things. Therefore, O my God, have mercy upon all who are in the Bayan through Thy mercy by guiding them to the path of Thy forgiveness, for Thou art indeed independent of all Thy creation. The proofs of Thy obedience are thereby exalted and the proofs of disobedience to Thee are thereby remote from Thee. Otherwise, Thou hast ever been independent of all things and self-sufficient above all that beareth the name of a thing. All things are dependent upon Thee for their very existence, and all are Thy worshippers, prostrate before Thee, devoted to Thee, mindful of Thee, thankful to Thee, praising Thee and glorifying Thee, each within its own limits - some according to what Thou hast loved, some in previous manifestations, and some according to what Thou lovest in the manifestation of Thy wondrous creation. Glorified art Thou, O my God! I ask forgiveness of Thee for all things and I turn in repentance unto Thee from all things. Verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful, and Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. Thy forgiveness toward the dwellers of Thy kingdom and Thy mercy toward those in the dominion of Thy earth and the wonders of Thy grace appear not save that Thou sendest forth One Who seizeth and manifesteth destruction, that all Thy creation may enter, through a compelling force from Thee, into forgiveness, and through Thy subduing power into the dawning-places of Thy mercy. Verily Thou art the Knower of all things and Thou art powerful over all things.The Third of the ThirdIn the Name of God, the One, the One!Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent things, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existent things, Who hath made Himself victorious in His triumph above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, Who hath made Himself transcendent in His transcendence above all similitudes and allusions, and Who hath made Himself mighty in His might above all things. Therefore do I bear witness \[...\]

Magnified be His power over all things! I testify, and all created things bear witness, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing - a testimony purified from whatsoever imaginings may occur or understandings may pursue, a testimony wherein His firstness indicates His lastness and His outward manifestation His inward reality, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling. He seizes whomsoever He willeth through His command from the Manifestation of His Self. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Seizing. I testify, and all created things bear witness, that the Letters of the Seven are the repository of His names and the dawning-place of His attributes. God hath chosen him for Himself, then chosen for him whatsoever He willeth from the kingdom of His command and creation, that those who reason may be led to know that there is none other God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the FourthIn the Name of God, the Seizer, the Seizer!Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Seizer, the Seizer! The glory from God be upon the First One and upon him who resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that God, glorified be He, in His Essence is sanctified above all attributes and names, yet naught is seen therein save the One, the Manifest. If thou attainest unto the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then seize those who believe not in Him, for this is the deed that shall profit thee before Him Whom God shall make manifest. And if thou art in the darkest night and God manifesteth unto thee the means, then seize those who believe not in God, the One, the All-Compelling. Otherwise, be patient in the path of God and seize through thy words those who believe not in God, thy Lord, by cursing them, for this is among the ways of seizing when physical seizing is not possible - words intended for action, that thereby thou mayest comfort the hearts of those who grieve for God's sake and cause those who believe in God their Lord to turn unto God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.The First in the FirstIn the Name of God, the Most Remote, the Most Remote!There is none other God but Him, the Most Remote, the Most Remote! Say: God is more remote than any possessor of remoteness. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His remote power. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath been One remote, removing, and far. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them do glorify. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the dominion and the kingdom, then the might and the divine power, then the strength and the celestial realm, then the power and the ruby essence, then the sovereignty and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single \[...\]

Nothing escapes His grasp, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command; verily, He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and in what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and in what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and in what lieth between them. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Before Him boweth down whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and in what lieth between them, and unto Him shall all return. The Creator of the heavens and the earth and of what lieth between them, His command is nearer than the utterance "Be, and it is." Say: How is it that with a single Pen ye write all that ye love, whether it be the weight of silver or that which none can reckon save God? Thus hath God ordained it. He createth all things. Will ye not see? Unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and unto Him shall all return. Say: Verily the Command of God appeareth only through Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all appear through His command. Say: At this time, none in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them possesseth any command that can be proven to be from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, except from the Point of the Bayan. Will ye not see? Say: If ye be in doubt concerning this, then bring forth His verses from God which prove that command to be from Him. Say: Glory be to God! Exalted is He above what they associate with Him. There is no god besides God Who could manifest a command as He willeth through His command. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: God is nearer to you than your own selves. Will ye not see? Say: God is more remote than what your hearts can comprehend. Will ye not perceive? Say: Nearness and remoteness are alike in His sight. Will ye not witness? If ye draw nigh unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, then shall ye attain nearness unto God. And if ye distance yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest, your belief will not profit you, nor will ye possess aught that can benefit you or draw you nigh unto God, your Lord. Will ye not draw nigh? Say: All glory in their faith in God. O all things! Believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, for through this shall ye be glorified. And whosoever believeth not in Him is like unto one who believeth not in God his Lord. God is independent of those who believe and those who believe not. But they who believe have grown rich through their faith, and they rejoice in the paradise of His good-pleasure \[...\] They who believe not in God and His signs, in this first life and in the hereafter, are veiled by the fire and shall not be helped. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the Single, the Inaccessible, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: God causeth all things to die and then giveth life unto all things.

Verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved! Say: God causeth all things to die and then quickeneth them, and verily there is none other God but He, the Dominant, the Beloved. Say: God is sufficient unto me; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the trusting ones put their trust. Say: God is my glory; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the assured ones put their trust. Say: God is my support; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the God-fearing ones put their trust. Say: God is my shelter; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the sincere ones put their trust. Say: God is my protection; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the knowing ones put their trust. Say: God is my strength; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek strength put their trust. Say: God is my last end; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the trusting ones put their trust. Say: God is the One Who ordaineth my will in the first life; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the responsive ones put their trust. Say: God is my glory; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the glorious ones put their trust. Say: God is my majesty; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the trusting ones put their trust. Say: God is my beauty; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek beauty put their trust. Say: God is my grandeur; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek grandeur put their trust. Say: God is my light; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek illumination put their trust. Say: God is my knowledge; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all the knowing ones put their trust. Say: God is my power; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek power put their trust. Say: God is my sufficiency; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek sufficiency put their trust. Say: God is my good-pleasure; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let the veiled ones put their trust. Say: God is my honor; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek honor put their trust. Say: God is my sovereignty; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek sovereignty put their trust. Say: God is my dominion; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek dominion put their trust. Say: God is my signs; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who marvel put their trust. Say: God is my words; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who discern put their trust. Say: God is my most exalted height; in Him do I put my trust, and in God let all who seek exaltation put their trust. Say: God is too exalted to be mentioned without Him, and all are His servants, and all goodly names are attributable unto God even as ye from the beginning attribute them unto God, your Lord. Glory be to God that there should be anyone before or after Him, and all bear witness that there is none other God but He, the Dominant, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore call ye upon that Name, then through it draw ye nigh unto God, your Lord. Say: Verily God is near in His remoteness and remote in His nearness. Will ye not fear Him? Say: Were there an atom in a rock beneath the seventh sea, verily God would know it and would be nearer to it than itself, and would know its secret and its whisper and its beginning \[...\]

O Lord my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and grandeur, Thine the power and divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the dominion over the world of nature, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the presence and perfection, Thine the mercy and judgment, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the symbols and parables, Thine the stations and sublimity, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the grandeur and transcendence, Thine the might and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and dominion.Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, everlasting, enduring, self-dependent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in Thy creation nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou created all things and ordained them according to Thy decree. By Thy will hast Thou given form to all things and shaped them according to Thy design.Thou hast ever been near in Thy remoteness and remote in Thy nearness, knowing all things, powerful over all things, and sovereign over all things. All worship Thee in the glory of Thy unity and glorify Thee in the garments of Thy majestic grandeur. Thou art the One Who existed before all things and Who will endure after the passing of all things. The extinction of Thy creation is naught but their veiling from Him Whom God shall make manifest and the Dawning Places of Thy revelation in every dispensation, and the life of Thy creation is naught but their recognition of Thee in every dispensation through what Thou revealest of the signs of Thy power as Thou willest and how Thou willest.Therefore, O my God, send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with all Thy glory, beauty, majesty, greatness, light, mercy, words, names, might, favors, knowledge, power, strength, attributes, nobility, sovereignty, dominion, exaltation, and whatsoever Thou possesseth of Thy names which ever give life \[...\]

And whatsoever Thou art in Thy names, Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the Sovereign Whose dominion passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou hast made the manifestation of Thy proof none other than the manifestation of that Reality which Thou didst establish through the Manifestation of Thy Messenger aforetime, when Thou didst teach him from Thy presence the rending of the veils of glory without allusion, the effacement of illusion, the consciousness of the known, the tearing of the veil through the triumph of the mystery, the drawing of oneness to the attribute of unity, and the light that shone forth from the Dayspring of eternity upon the temples of unity and its effects.O God! Do Thou enable all who are in the Bayan to witness that Reality of realities, that essential Camphor, that pristine Essence, that pure Substance, that abstract Truth, and that divine Adornment for which Thou didst create all things, that on that Day all Thy creation may recognize its own self, that there is no God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Remote, the Most RemotePraise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath ascended in His elevation above all created things, and hath become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existing things, and hath appeared in His manifestation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath prevailed in His dominion over all atoms, and hath triumphed in His victory over all symbols and allusions, and hath shone forth in His splendor above all beings.He beareth witness, and all His creation, that there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling - a testimony transcendent above conjunction and sanctified from division, a testimony that filleth the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them with the wondrous signs of His mercy among those in the kingdoms of Command and Creation and all that lieth between them from eternal manifestations.He beareth witness, and all His creation, that there is no God but Him, and that the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word through Whom the Bayan was sent down, and the Proof was established, and Paradise was made manifest, and the fires were nullified, and all possibilities were revealed to the highest degrees of existence, as a token from His presence through His manifestation and a grace from His court at His appearance.Unto Him be praise - praise radiant with the effects of holiness and glory and dawning from the court of might and beauty - praise shining and gleaming, tribute brilliant and resplendent, Who was exalted and elevated, Who became inaccessible and unattainable, Who illumined and was illumined, Who enlightened and was enlightened, Who explained and was explained - praise that hath no equal in His knowledge, no peer in His Book, no likeness in His earth, no associate in the kingdom of His Command and Creation, and no suspension in His designation of the manifestations of His might and holiness and the dawning-places of His mystery \[...\]

All praise belongs to God, the One Who causes all things to speak of His oneness, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious. Verily, He Who is manifest in the Seven Letters has chosen servants as He pleased and ordained whatsoever He desired. His is all praise for His decrees and His ordinances - praise that none can comprehend save Him, and none can fathom its knowledge except Him. Such praise attests that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious, the Fourth in the Fourth.In the Name of God, the Most Remote, the Most Remote. All praise belongs to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Remote, the Most Remote. And verily, the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembles that One, wherein naught can be seen except the First One.I testify that God, exalted and glorified be He, stands in equal relation to all things. In the unseen realm, none can comprehend the manifestation of eternity nor the concealment of destiny. However, I shall inform thee concerning the world of creation and the paths of divine authority. Observe then how, at the dawning of the Point of the Bayan, His relation was to all created things. Whatever thou hast witnessed in creation - whether beloved or forbidden, manifest or hidden, dominant or prevailing, near or remote, exalted - these are but limitations of mirrors, else the relation of that which is reflected is equal. He established His Cause in clay and made it a Prophet, then in man and made him the Gate of Paradise, then in a form less than man and made it less than Paradise. All are quickened by the same living water from the Point of Truth of the Bayan.This is God's mystery in the kingdom of the clouds, His power in the heights of radiance, His might in the realm of Sinai, His dominion in the dawning-places of creation, and His authority in the daysprings of invention. Never hath the pole of heaven witnessed its like, neither in the past nor recently. It indicates naught but God and speaks of none but Him. All are in awe of His fear, all tremble at His sovereignty, all are fearful of His Lordship, all are humbled before His dominion, all are grateful for His commands, and all are content with His prohibitions.His is the most sublime similitude in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. And He has four stations. The First in the First:In the Name of God, the Most Noble, the Most Noble. There is none other God but Him, the Most Noble, the Most Noble. Say: God is more noble than any possessor of nobility. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the dominion of His nobility. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is noble and ennobled. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: all are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and the earth glorify \[...\]

God hath testified that there is none other God but Him. His is the dominion of earth and heaven and all that lieth between them. Say: All are submissive unto Him. His is the Kingdom and the Realm of Might, then the Glory and the Sovereignty, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Dominion and the Human World. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Whose sovereignty passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting.Glorified be God, the Lord of Dominion and Kingdom! Glorified be God, the Lord of Glory and Sovereignty! Glorified be God, the Lord of Power and Divine Essence! Glorified be God, the Lord of Strength and the Ruby! Glorified be God, the Lord of Dominion and the Human World!

Glorified be God, the Lord of Power and Exaltation! Glorified be God, the Lord of Authority and Detachment!Say: All things within their limits manifest the signs of the One in His presence. Can ye not see? Even if ye were to look upon an ant, ye would find within it all these most excellent names in its creation. Therefore, belittle not any of God's creatures, but look unto Him Who created all things by His command. However, no manifestation of glorification in the kingdom shall appear that doth not point to God through sovereignty and power. Not a single atom remaineth upon the earth but that He possesseth it through truth. This befitteth none save Him Whom God shall make manifest and those who are guides unto the Point of the Bayan, who are, by His leave, the orbits of religion revolving.Praise be to God, there is none other God but He, the Lord of Dominion and Kingdom! Praise be to God, there is none other God but He, the Lord of Glory and Sovereignty! Praise be to God, there is none other God but He, the Lord of Power and Divine Essence!

Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other god, the Possessor of Power and Exaltation! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other god, the Possessor of Might and Loftiness! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other god, the Possessor of Sovereignty and Power! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other god, the Possessor of Joy and Gladness!Say: The signs of the One are in all things - will ye not behold them? God's reckoning is in an ant, yet if ye were to witness all that is on earth within His grasp - Him Whom God shall make manifest - then verily ye would testify that these are among those signs.God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of the Kingdom and the Realm Above! God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of Might and Dominion! God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of Power and the Divine Realm! God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of Sovereignty and the Human Realm!

God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of Joy and Gladness! God testifieth that there is none other god besides Him, the Possessor of Sovereignty and Power!Say: The signs of the One are in all things - will ye not behold them? Should God reveal the like of what God hath sent down through His knowledge, then all things would be within the grasp of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and ye would then be among the signs of the Bayan to which ye bear witness. Exalted be God, the Possessor of Kingdom and the Realm Above! Exalted be God, the Possessor of Might and Dominion!

Exalted is God, Who possesseth power and the realm of divinity! Exalted is God, Who possesseth might and the ruby! Exalted is God, Who possesseth sovereignty and the realm of humanity! Exalted is He Who possesseth glory and majesty! Exalted is God, Who possesseth beauty and comeliness! Exalted is God, Who possesseth the countenance and perfection! Exalted is God, Who possesseth grandeur and independence! Exalted is God, Who possesseth awe and sublimity! Exalted is God, Who possesseth similitude and parables!

Exalted is God, the Lord of glory and invincibility! Exalted is God, the Lord of loftiness and elevation! Exalted is God, the Lord of joy and gladness! Exalted is God, the Lord of sovereignty and might! Say: All glory before Him Whom God shall make manifest is but supreme abasement, and through Him shall all glory be attained in His presence and in the presence of those who dwell in the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them. This is the glory of God unto all worlds. Say: All are humble before glory.The Second of the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the glory and the might, Thine the power and the divine realm, Thine the strength and the ruby, Thine the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine the glory and the majesty, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the power and action, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the might and justice, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the stations and magnificence, Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and might. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Independent. Thou hast taken neither companion nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in sovereignty, nor any protector in the earth save by Thy leave. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. Therefore, O my God, make all things in the Bayan redound to the glory of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, to the might of Him Whom Thou shalt elevate, to the majesty of Him Whom Thou shalt magnify, to the beauty of Him Whom Thou shalt adorn, to the grandeur of Him Whom Thou shalt exalt, to the loftiness of Him Whom Thou shalt raise up, and to the power of Him Whom Thou shalt cause to reign. Verily Thou art powerful over all things.The Third of the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!All praise be to Him Who hath exalted Himself through His loftiness above all created things, Who hath prevailed through His dominion over all existence, Who hath manifested His sovereignty over all beings, Who hath revealed His majesty above all atoms, and Who hath demonstrated His grandeur above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He is the One in His essence and the Exalted One in the kingdom of names and attributes. He hath no peer, no equal, no likeness, no partner, and no similitude. He hath ever existed before all things in glory and majesty, and will forever exist after all things in grandeur and beauty.He hath chosen a sublime essence, an exalted abstraction, a transcendent simplicity, a radiant purity, and a primordial reality. Then He revealed Himself unto it through itself, and through it He became sanctified from all else. He cast into its identity the likeness of its own essence. Thus did His actions appear through it, His examples shine forth from it, His manifestations dawn from it, His signs gleam from it, and His words reverberate through it, until He filled thereby His heaven and His earth, testifying that there is no God but Him and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath no sun of reality except Him, and He hath chosen for it beloved primary names, then filled therewith all who dwell in the kingdom of His names and examples, until He caused it to enter the sea of infinity through the declaration that there is no God but Him. This is the First in the First, this is the Last in the Last, this is the Hidden in the Hidden, and this is the Manifest in the Manifest. God indicateth naught but God in His beginning and His end. All are guided by Him.In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!All praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Indeed all glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that the glory of God hath not been manifested in that kingdom except through the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, for the Divine Essence is an inaccessible sanctity, an exalted sovereignty, a mighty sovereign, a beloved ruler, and a triumphant sustainer. No thing can comprehend Him whilst He comprehendeth all things, and He is the One, the Glorious.If thou wishest to understand the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest, imagine that all who are on earth have attained the utmost limits possible in their glory, such that no higher station could be conceived for their rank. Then if He Whom God shall make manifest should recognize Himself, even were He dwelling in the dust, at that very moment all who are on earth should prostrate themselves before Him. Such is the glory of all who are on earth in relation to the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for His glory and honor are above all who possess glory \[...\]

His glory transcendeth every glory, and His majesty is such that no earthly sovereignty can bear it, by reason of its supreme loftiness and exalted dominion. If thou art one upon the earth, there is none equal to thee in glory save thyself in the glory of knowledge, power, and beloved names. Then prostrate thyself before Him Whom God shall make manifest at the Point of the Bayan, for glory was created only for submission unto Him and humility before Him. Verily, glory and all who possess it shall bow down before Him, and whoso boweth not before Him is lower than the most lowly in the sight of God and those endued with knowledge, though he be deemed glorious by men. For glory existeth only through faith in Him and His good-pleasure - this, this is the ultimate glory if thou dost comprehend, then be thou of the thankful ones.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the All-Sufficing, the All-Sufficing. There is no God but He, the All-Sufficing, the All-Sufficing. Say: God sufficeth above every sufficing one. None can escape from the sovereignty of His all-sufficing power, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath been an all-sufficient Sufficing One. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the grandeur, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and sovereignty, then the rule and the earthly realm. He giveth life and causeth death, and causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the Sovereign Who perisheth not, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God sufficeth all things beyond all things, but nothing in the heavens or on the earth or between them sufficeth beyond God thy Lord. Verily He hath been an all-sufficient Sufficing One. Say: Verily, after Him Whom God shall make manifest, He shall suffice all things beyond all things, but nothing in the heavens or on the earth or between them sufficeth beyond Him. And sufficient is the proof of our Lord, the All-Merciful, as a support and protection. Say: Though thou shouldst possess all that is on earth on the day of His manifestation, it would not suffice thee \[...\]

Say: Were ye to possess all that is on earth on the Day of His Manifestation, it would suffice you. And ye should enrich yourselves, if ye truly believe in God and in Him Whom He shall make manifest. And if ye possess naught, God will suffice you, then His Proof, then those who are guides from His presence - they who are guided by God's command from His presence. Say: Let us speak words that your own souls would verify, if ye be of them that are certain of God and His signs. If ye say "God sufficeth us through what He hath revealed of His Cause through the Manifestation of His Self," let nothing veil you from this utterance if ye be truthful in your words. Otherwise all speak that which they do not practice. Say: All glory that hath been and shall be created is from the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not perceive this? Say: All majesty that hath been and shall be created is from the majesty of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not recognize this? Say: All beauty that hath been and shall be created is from the beauty of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not see this? Say: All grandeur is from the grandeur of Him Whom He shall make manifest - can ye not acknowledge this? Say: All light that hath been and shall be created is from the light of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not be illumined by this? Say: All mercy that hath been and shall be created is from the mercy of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not obtain mercy? Say: All words that have been and shall be created are with perfection through Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not attain perfection? Say: All heavens that have been and shall be created are from the words of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not ascend? Say: All names that have been and shall be created are from the names of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not increase in understanding? Say: All might that hath been and shall be created is from the might of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not gain strength? Say: All will that hath been and shall be created is from the will of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not progress? Say: All knowledge that hath been and shall be created is from the knowledge of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not learn? Say: All power that hath been and shall be created is from the power of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not gain power? Say: All force that hath been and shall be created is from the force of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not be satisfied? Say: All riches that have been and shall be created are from the riches of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not become enriched? Say: All honor that hath been and shall be created is from the honor of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not become ennobled? Say: All sovereignty that hath been and shall be created is from the sovereignty of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not gain sovereignty? Say: All dominion that hath been and shall be created is from the dominion of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not gain dominion? Say: All loftiness that hath been and shall be created is from the loftiness of Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not become exalted? Say: All existence that hath been and shall be created is from Him Whom God shall make manifest - can ye not advance? Say: All signs that have been and shall be created are from the signs of Him Who shall be made manifest - can ye not become honored? All this is through the essence of knowledge with Him, if ye would but understand. We show you this that ye may remember. Look ye at every nation upon the earth - the religion of its people returns to \[...\]

All praise be unto God Who createth whatsoever verses He willeth through Him Whom He shall make manifest. Will ye not then show gratitude? All this proceedeth from the essence of knowledge that is with Him, could ye but understand. We reveal this unto you that ye might be reminded. Consider how in every nation upon the earth, all matters pertaining to their religion and worldly affairs return unto the command of their Prophet. When that Sun of Reality appeareth, can ye find any besides Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye be them that traverse the ocean of primal creation or ascend through the realm of names? All that hath been created and shall be created hath its beginning from God and returneth unto Him by His command. Therefore hath He created no greater Cause than that of Him Whom God shall make manifest. All things are from Him, could ye but witness it.Consider how in Islam all your glory returneth unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, through the degrees that God hath created within you, which none can reckon save God alone. Ye are all believers in the religion of Islam through your relationship to Muhammad, the Apostle of God. Likewise do ye witness the essence of every excellence through Him Whom God shall make manifest. For verily the essence of all creation is to attain unto His good-pleasure. Thus the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest is the good-pleasure of your Lord. O all things! Ye were created to attain unto that which He Whom God shall make manifest loveth, not that which ye love. For whosoever loveth that which Him Whom God shall make manifest loveth not hath indeed worshipped other than God.Fear ye God on the day of His manifestation. Let not your love be for aught save His love, nor seek ye any pleasure but His pleasure. For though your piety reach the highest degree, if He Whom God shall make manifest be not pleased with it, it shall be counted as less than piety in the sight of God. Therefore fear ye God by following the good-pleasure of the Truth that is from Him, if ye be sincere in your claim. Otherwise all nations have practiced piety according to what they possess, yet have entered the fire while supposing themselves to abide in God's good-pleasure. Say: Nay! Verily God's good-pleasure in the Bayan until the Day of Resurrection is that ye should on that day take the good-pleasure of the Most Glorious through whatsoever He Whom God shall make manifest shall utter. This is the light of God for all who are in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. Say: All are guided by it.O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without peer. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Might and the Power, the Strength and the Glory, the Force and the Authority, the Sovereignty and the Realm, the Grandeur and the Majesty, the Beauty and the Grace, the Countenance and the Perfection, the Might and the Action, the Example and the Exemplar, the Mercy and the Bounty, the Sovereignty and the Justice, the Hosts and the Independence, the Glory and the Sublimity, the Might and the Inaccessibility, the Power and the Exaltation, the Joy and the Gladness, and the \[...\]

Thine is the dominion and the opening, and Thine is the sufficiency and the culmination, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love from the kingdom of Thy Cause and Thy creation. Thou hast ever been the All-Sufficient unto all Thy creation through Thy most excellent sufficiency and Thy supreme protection. How all-sufficient art Thou unto Thy creation, how compassionate toward Thy servants, how merciful unto the dwellers of Thy heaven and earth, how beneficent unto those in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation, and how generous unto that which Thou hast created or wilt create by Thy leave! Thou hast ever been existent before all things, a Being above all things, an Essence with all things, a Creator above all things, and One Who will endure after the passing of all things. Thou hast created all things by Thy power and ordained the measures of all things by Thy grandeur.Glorified art Thou! Thou hast kindled the lamp of Will, whereupon all lamps shine forth therefrom. Thou hast caused the Sun of Truth to appear, whereupon all mirrors are illumined by that Sun. And verily, all who are in the Bayan - Thy bounty unto them is as Thy bounty unto the Point of the Bayan, would they but understand or remember. Glorified art Thou! How generous and exalted art Thou, for all speak by that which the Point of Truth hath spoken, and all bear witness by the testimony of the Eternal Essence.Therefore shall I thank Thee, O my God, for all that Thou hast created and wilt create, and shall praise Thee, O my Lord, for all that Thou hast brought into being and wilt bring into being, and shall glorify Thee, O my Creator, for all that Thou hast fashioned and wilt fashion, and shall magnify Thee, O my Fashioner, for all that Thou hast originated and wilt originate, and shall extol Thee, O Thou Who sufficeth me, for all that Thou hast caused to appear and wilt cause to appear.The Dawning-Places of Thy sufficiency have ever shone forth from the right and the left. None can seek sufficiency from any save Thee, nor find satisfaction in aught except Thee. By Thy might! Thou art the All-Sufficient unto all things above all things, and nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them can suffice without Thee. Thou didst say - and Thy word is the truth - in the Qur'an: "Is not God sufficient for His servant?" Yea, Thou art indeed, O my God, sufficient unto all things, before and after. And Thou didst later reveal in the Bayan - and Thy word is the truth: "Is not God sufficient for all the believers?" Yea, by Thy might, Thou art, O my God, sufficient unto all who believe.Through Thee have I found sufficiency from all else, and through Thee have I become independent of all besides Thee. Therefore suffice me, O my God, and all who are in the Bayan, through Thy mighty sufficiency and Thy impregnable protection. Verily, Thou hast power over all things and dost encompass all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Sufficient, the Most Sufficient. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His sublimity above all contingent things, and raised Himself in His loftiness above all created things, and made Himself inaccessible in His strength above all existing things, and manifested His sovereignty above all atoms, and revealed His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and drawn all through His attraction above all semblances and indications, and guided through His guidance above all that was and will be created by His signs \[...\]

All created things and His verses bear witness, and all His creation testifies, that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been, and will ever be. His eternity extends to the beginnings of beginninglessness, and His timelessness dwells in the sanctuary of grandeur and glory. He hath made no way for creation to know Him except through their powerlessness to know Him, for how can that which bears the name of a created thing serve as proof of His knowledge or as a path to His oneness? Glorified and exalted is He above what those who describe Him, whether of the ancients or the moderns, the manifest or the hidden, have described. The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds.Then bear witness, and let all creation testify, that there is none other God but Him. He hath chosen from among His creation a single Temple and made it the Sun of His Will, the Mystery of His eternity, the Inaccessibility of His grandeur, the Exaltation of His self-subsistence, the Joy of His oneness, the Content of His sovereign individuality, and the Splendor of His glory of independence. He caused it to speak forth verses that rendered all things powerless, wherein lay the knowledge of His unity and the paths of His good-pleasure, through His power, before any of His creatures could learn from another. Then He caused it to speak words before which all contingent beings stood powerless to comprehend, and signs that bewildered the realities of all essence, and evidences that all within the kingdoms of earth and heaven failed to grasp.Then He chose for the throne of His manifestation eternal names and immersed them in the limitless ocean of eternity. On that Day no truth existed save from Him, and no glory save in His good-pleasure. Through His manifestation He separated truth from falsehood, and annihilated falsehood through the ascendancy of every truth. All created things, past and future, praise Him for having conveyed from His Lord that which was entrusted to Him of His revelation, His wisdom, His decree and His justice. The Command of God hath never been suspended nor altered, neither before nor after, and God and His proof suffice as witness and helper.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the All-Sufficient, the All-Sufficient. Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the All-Sufficient, the All-Sufficient. And verily the glory from God is upon the Primal Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that the sufficiency of God was not manifest in that kingdom except through the sufficiency of the Sun of Truth, and this appeareth not save through the sufficiency of the Letters of the Living, and this appeareth not save through names that have entered the ocean of infinity. Verily thou art in the Orient of the earth. If thou seekest not sufficiency from anyone in the Bayan, this is from God's concealment through means that have reached thee. Look not to thyself nor to it, but look to God alone and seek shelter in the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest and what He commandeth thee. For verily He sufficeth thee above all things, while nothing sufficeth in His stead. Make thy remembrance from the beginning of thy life to its end: "O Thou Who sufficeth above all things while nothing sufficeth in Thy stead," that perchance through this continuance, on the Day of God's manifestation, thou mayest find sufficiency in Him Whom God shall make manifest rather than in another, for verily none other than Him sufficeth thee. This is the meaning of what He hath taught thee in thy remembrance, if thou be of those who seek sufficiency in God.

In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! No God is there but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted!Nothing sufficeth save Him, that perchance on the Day of God's Manifestation thou mayest find sufficiency in Him Whom God shall make manifest, apart from all else, for verily naught else can suffice thee. This is the meaning of what hath been taught thee in thy mention, if thou be of them that find sufficiency in God. And if thou desirest to exalt thy mention, recite this verse, for it is more glorious and more resplendent than aught else in the former and latter days.Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, and nothing sufficeth apart from God, thy Lord, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. God sufficeth as Protector and as Guardian.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! No God is there but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! Say: God is more exalted than any possessor of exaltation. None in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the sovereignty of His exalted dominion. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Calling, the All-Summoning, the All-Inviting.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.All praise be to God, Whom all things in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. No God is there but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them. No God is there but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily, they who call upon Him Whom God shall make manifest, these are they who call upon Him. God will answer them on the day of the manifestation of His Own Self, saying: "O all things! It is Him Whom ye invoke!" For verily, ye hear not any mention that would profit you except that ye call upon God through Him Whom God shall make manifest, for verily, ye shall then hear at once. Be not veiled from your prayers, for those who call upon God through that which returneth unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and who prostrate themselves before Him - these shall enter the Fire, and therein shall they find no helper.Say: All upon the earth call upon the Point of the Bayan unknowingly, but God loveth not their prayers save those who call upon God through Me and who know Me. Say: It hath been revealed unto Me that there is no God but I, the Answerer, the Beloved. Say: O My servants! Call ye upon Me on the day of My manifestation, for verily before that ye hear not your answer \[...\]

Say: He hath indeed descended, there is no God but I, the Answerer, the Best-Beloved. Say: O My servants! Call ye upon Me in the day of My Manifestation, for verily ye did not hear your answer before that, nor were ye able to encompass it with knowledge. When ye call upon the Manifestation of My Self on the Day of Resurrection, then will He answer you from My presence. This is what ye loved before the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily I am the All-Hearing, the Near One, and verily I am the Answerer, the Kind. I will surely answer everyone who calleth upon Me, for I am the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All that ye call upon through the Point of the Bayan, I will surely answer your prayer, then through the Letters of the Living do ye turn unto Me. And on the Day of My Manifestation, I will surely answer whatever ye call upon, except if ye appear not before Him Whom We shall make manifest and prostrate not yourselves. I am God, there is no God but I. All things call upon Me with their secret and manifest tongue, though they observe not their own form. And verily I will answer the prayer of all things, for I am the Ever-Living, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. And if I delay the answer to anything, this is due to what I know to be good for it in the Book. O all things! Be ye not dismayed, for verily I know you better than your own selves, and I see you more clearly than ye see yourselves. Call ye upon Me through Him Whom I have given clear proofs, if ye desire to hear what is revealed from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Behold how all upon the earth call upon God, their Lord, and all do humble themselves in their prayers. Yet God answereth not their prayers, for they are veiled from His proof. Say: He answereth only the prayers of those who have believed in the Bayan and who follow what God hath ordained. Watch ye for the Day of God's Manifestation, for your claims, like yourselves, shall be rendered null, except if ye call upon Him Whom God shall make manifest, that God may send down His verses upon you from the Manifestation of His Self, through Whom ye shall attain all good. Say: Your calling upon God, your Lord, is better for you than all that is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye would but reflect a little. Though your purposes are created by God, yet ye call not upon God, and We answer you not, for ye are greater in your own stations than all of them, if ye call upon the Truth. Call not upon anything that would make void your prayer while ye know not. Say: Call ye upon God as beseemeth Him, then remember all things in their proper measure before Him. And if ye call upon God to provide for you, and in your prayer ye have read your own provision, then seek forgiveness of God and turn unto Him. Likewise is it with all that beareth the name of anything when ye call upon God, your Lord, in truth, whether He answer you or reject you, if ye be discerning in your prayer. And if ye call upon Him Whom God shall make manifest and He answer you, this is a bounty from God upon you. O all things! Be ye thankful unto Him. This is what God hath answered from His presence. O all things! Then seek ye Him. And if ye are denied what ye have asked for, this is from God's justice - ye should praise Him for it.

And if I deny you what you have asked for, that is from God's justice - you should praise Him for it. Let not your faith waver whether your request is granted or denied, if you truly call upon Him. Otherwise, you have merely called upon your own desire and have not truly called upon He who created you, sustains you, causes you to die and brings you to life. Be mindful of yourselves on the Day of Resurrection, for verily you, O people of the Bayan, shall be tested. Perchance He Whom God shall make manifest may deny your requests, whereupon you will find yourselves deprived of what befits Him. In such case your supplication would be greater than any sin, if you would but reflect. Let not your circumstances alter you, for whatsoever appears from God is truth, whether He grants or denies your request. This is a bounty for those who ask, and this is God's justice for the supplicants. Say: If you knew what God has ordained regarding asking, you would never ask anyone anything. And if you knew what God has ordained regarding every answer, you would never deny anyone. Is it befitting that God should be questioned? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe. Say: From the first moment God made Me manifest until now, I have called out to all things: "O all things! Answer ye My call!" This is God's call, if you would but see. Has God created anyone more constrained than one who desires a response from Him to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and earth and all that lies between them, while all are veiled from Him? How then do you not answer God by responding to the Manifestation of His Self, while you hear His call day and night? Thus does God show you your deeds, for you hear not nor answer the call of your Lord's Proof. How then do you expect God to hear and answer you through the Manifestation of His Self? This is the essence of what appears from God, if you but knew. Say: Yea, all hear My call and all shall answer Me. O all things! You see no one when he calls you, but if you see him possessing sovereignty, this is one of God's mysteries, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. For Muhammad claimed aforetime over all created things past and future: "O all things! Answer ye My call in God's Cause!" Though He possessed sovereignty over all created things past and future, it behooved Him not to ask of anyone. But God permitted Him to ask you so that God might see what you are capable of. O all things! Behold how God aids His Proof if you truly call upon Him. And if you cannot answer someone's call, then answer with noble and mighty words that grieve not his heart. Otherwise answer according to your capacity, for this is God's bounty if you but knew. The most honored before God are those who answer the call of creation before they speak, responding to what their inner reality expresses even as they answer when they speak. These are God's chosen ones in the kingdom of the heavens \[...\]

And they respond when they speak - these are the friends of God in the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and these are they who shall attain. They observe within the dominion and reach out to each according to what they secretly ask, and these are they who bear witness from God. These are the Dawning-Places of God's Command, and these are they who shall attain. Say: Ponder ye! God hath forbidden you to reject anyone's supplication even if it be to the weight of nineteen times nineteen mustard seeds of clay - how then would God call you when He Whom God shall make manifest summoneth you to believe in the Truth, yet ye respond not? Will ye not respond to God Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life, and desireth to admit you into the paradise of His knowledge, while ye, by this, remain steadfast in the true Faith? Answer ye Him Whom God shall make manifest before His heart is saddened by all that ye witness. Verily, He loveth this heart of His. Tarry not when He asketh you or writeth unto you, but answer Him with all that ye are able, and respond to Him with all that ye can accomplish. Say: We call upon God Who hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, by all the good that His knowledge encompasseth. There is no God but He, the One, the All-Answering. Say: Verily God addresseth at this moment: "There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thou hast called upon Me through all things, and I shall answer thee before thy prayer is ended. O all things! Verily I am God, there is no God but I, the One, the All-Bountiful. I have sent down all good in the Bayan - thou and all things take from this." Thus doth God answer the prayer of him who calleth upon Him in truth. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the Near. Say: Verily the caller is the one called upon, would ye but understand. Say: Verily the answerer is the one answered, would ye but know. Comprehend ye this, for this is from one Temple, would ye but understand. Otherwise, verily the One called upon is God, and the one who calleth upon Him is My Being - thus do ye remember this. And likewise doth My Being ask of God its Lord, and God answereth it, yet both appear not from that Temple in this way, even as We have revealed in clear revelation. Otherwise, glorified be God above all that He hath created or will create. There is no God but He, the Single, the Most High, the Exalted. Say: What preventeth you from asking of anyone is that perchance ye may call upon Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. God hath permitted all things to call upon God their Lord - O all things, upon Him do ye call. And God hath forbidden all things to call upon aught else, for that which is other than God is powerless before Him. How can the powerless answer the prayer of its like? Say: Glorified be God! All are powerless before God. But ye must look to the Dawning-Places of God's Command, then from there call ye upon God your Lord. All that ye see in the dominion are the Dawning-Places of God's Command - ye all take from the treasuries of His Command.

But you should look to the Dawning-Places of the Cause of God, and from thence call upon God, your Lord. All that you see in creation are Dawning-Places of God's Cause, and you shall receive all things from the treasuries of His command. Be not impatient that God should send down to you what you seek, for God has created you and taught you knowledge of what you ask from Him. Understand it through its means from your Lord, for this is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Cut off your gaze from yourselves and all means except God Who created you, and call upon all things with truth before God. Entrust your prayers to Him, then respond to what He answers, that you may attain all good from Him. This is from God's bounty to you on the Day of Resurrection at God's throne - be not grieved.Call upon Him Whom God shall make manifest concerning the measures of your religion and your world, and be content with what He ordains for you, for that is what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting has ordained. Let not what God has ordained for you be changed by love of your own selves, for you know not what is best for yourselves, nor do you encompass it with knowledge. You may call upon God for something while it is harmful for you and you know not; and perhaps you ask not for something while it is good for you with God, yet you encompass it not with knowledge and know not. But God looks upon you and will cause you to attain what you seek of His bounty in accordance with what is best for you in the kingdom of the heavens and earth and what lies between them. God knows all that you know not.Ask of Him Whom God shall make manifest and entrust to His knowledge, for that is what God has permitted you. For all things are manifested through what you seek of God's bounty. Say: Yea, His knowledge suffices beyond all your asking, but you have been commanded to manifest what you love. This is the path of God for those in the kingdom of the heavens and earth and what lies between them. Say: All paths lead to one path in the Mother Book, if you would understand. That is the word of Him Whom God shall make manifest, lest you call upon anyone and call upon him causing his heart to grieve while you know not, and if he calls you to a matter you respond not to it and know not - thereby you enter into the veils of fire even though you call upon him night and day.Say: All on earth call upon Me and turn to Me, and I call them to enter into the religion of God, whereupon some remain veiled and some accept. Say: God will help and answer the prayer of all things, and desires to cause all things to enter into the Most Great Paradise from Him. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And it has four stations: The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Awe-Inspiring, the Most Awe-Inspiring. Say: God is more awe-inspiring than any possessor of awe. None in the heavens can resist the sovereign authority of His awe \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Awesome, the Most Awesome! Say: God is the Most Awesome, above all that inspire awe. None can escape from the dominion of His awesome sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been awe-inspiring, awesome, and fearsome.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all who are in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will surely fill you with awe on the Day of Resurrection, that Day which you await. That is the Day when, should you withhold from saying "Yea," God will render void all your deeds done for His sake, due to your withholding from saying "Yea" to Him Whom God shall make manifest, that perchance on that Day you may dwell secure in God's protection and be not filled with dread.How often will the Day of Resurrection come upon you and He Whom God shall make manifest appear, while you supplicate day and night. Then when He sendeth down unto you Books written in His hand, you forbid yourselves from acknowledging Him Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die, and gave you life. Then you will not have worshipped from the beginning that hath no beginning, and it behooveth you to annihilate yourselves and cease to exist.This is the awe of Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of His manifestation. O all things! It is this that filleth you with awe. For this is the essence of all things - if you take hold of it, then shall you dwell secure in God's protection. And should you fear being slain in His path, let not your hearts be filled with dread, for you behold the good-pleasure of God.But should you veil yourselves from this while believing in your lives, then will He Whom God shall make manifest remember you with the word "Nay." Then will your hearts be filled with dread and your souls and deeds be brought to naught, as though you comprehended nothing of the matter.O all things! Reflect upon those against whom the number of the letter Waw hath been decreed. Some recognized the Cause of God and ascended unto Him, their hearts unfilled with dread, and they now receive their reward in the lofty chambers of Paradise.

And at that time in the chambers of paradise they shall receive recompense for what they had dreaded outwardly when they entered the fire, and God shall cause them to hear mention of His proof whereby their hearts are filled with dread and their souls and deeds are brought to naught, and they shall be unable to help themselves. O all things! Have mercy upon yourselves, for I fear not for you that you have failed to worship God in any way - is there any dread equal to this, if you but knew? Your hearts are not certain that this is truly a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, and you imagine that you do good; but God has testified that it is indeed a Book from Him, and those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest are themselves convinced of this. O God! Fill with dread of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest the hearts of all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, that when they hear mention of Him they may stand firm. And O God! Fill the hearts of those who believe not in Him with the utmost dread from Thee - verily Thou art powerful over all things. And O God! Fill the hearts of those who believe in Him and who on the day of His manifestation are certain of His signs with might and reverence - verily Thou art powerful over all things. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, the Manifest above His servants, the Inaccessible from aforetime, and the Omnipotent in the earth. He causes to die and brings to life, then causes to die and brings to life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Whose dominion changeth not, the One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by Thy command - verily Thou art the Subduer, the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant us security on that Day through Thy mercy, for Thou art the Best of those who show mercy. Fill us not with dread of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection - by Thy might, for Thou art the Best of those who grant security. Show us no severity on the Day of Resurrection, but cover us with Thy grace, for Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. Shelter us in every good-pleasure of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, even if we be sorrowful, for the ultimate victory shall be ours as we are patient. Should all on earth be in our possession, we would still triumph through the truth; and should we possess nothing, we would still be content with the truth. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Let not Him Who manifesteth Thyself on the Day of Resurrection desire anything beyond what Thou hast created or wilt create, and preserve Him, O God, with a mighty preservation. And if ye hear words containing dread, mention them not in the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest lest His soul be grieved, while ye have power over this. Stand between Him and all dread or fear. O angels of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, all of you together! O all things! Stand between Him Whom God shall make manifest and those who would grieve Him. Say: May all be His ransom if ye would truly sacrifice. This is the path in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, if ye would sacrifice. And His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night \[...\]

To Him belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day. There is no God but Him, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Awesome, the Most Awesome.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, and Thine the Glory and the Might, and Thine the Power and the Divine Realm, and Thine the Strength and the Ruby, and Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, and Thine the Glory and the Majesty, and Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, and Thine the Face and the Perfection, and Thine the Example and the Examples, and Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, and Thine the Mercy and the Grace, and Thine the Authority and the Justice, and Thine the Greatness and the Independence, and Thine the Awe and the Splendor, and Thine the Might and the Invincibility, and Thine the Power and the Exaltation, and Thine the Joy and the Gladness, and Thine the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Command and Thy creation.Thou hast ever been the Subduer above all contingent beings, and the Manifest above all existing things, and the Invincible above all created things, and the Exalted above all atoms, and the Most High above all who dwell in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and the All-Powerful above all particles.Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Eternal, Unique, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Powerful, Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Independent, Exalted, Joyous, Glorious, Beautiful, Great, Luminous, Merciful, Supreme, Mighty, Powerful, Sovereign, Possessing all, Noble, Manifest, Hidden, Awesome. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Therefore, O my God, place between every awe that Thou hast created or wilt create, and the Point of the Bayan and the exponents of obedience to Thee therein, and cause this to reach Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and then the exponents of His good-pleasure in Thee, through all Thy splendor and majesty and beauty and greatness and light and mercy and words and names and might and will and knowledge and power and utterance and questions and nobility and sovereignty and dominion and loftiness and whatsoever Thou possessest of Thy names and examples. For verily, I know no excellence like that which filleth anyone with gladness and might, and I seek not Thy permission to mention anyone with awe or that whereby he feareth for himself. Therefore, O my God, protect me and all Thy creation from this, and inspire, O my God, all Thy servants that they shall not manifest from themselves that which would cause any of Thy loved ones to desire \[...\]

O God! Inspire all Thy servants that nothing should appear from them that would cause any of Thy loved ones to turn away. Thou hast revealed this so that all may be freed from their veils and enter into Thy paradise. How beloved and exalted art Thou! How mighty and merciful art Thou! How generous and gracious art Thou! How protecting and preserving art Thou! How kind and munificent art Thou! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and upon all who believe in Him, as Thou hast ordained a measure for all things and a recorded time for all things. Verily, Thou art the All-Dominating, the Best-Beloved. Verily, Thou art the Most High, the Most Feared. Verily, Thou art the Inaccessible, the Most Desired. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Most Praised. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Worshipped One. Verily, Thou art the Supreme Ruler, the Well-Known. Verily, Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Thanked.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Awe-inspiring, the Most Awe-inspiring. Praise be to God Who hath elevated Himself through His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath manifested His dominion above all existing things, and hath revealed His manifestation above all created things, and hath raised Himself through His elevation above all atoms, and hath made Himself inaccessible through His inaccessibility above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath magnified Himself through His magnificence above all similitudes and allusions, and hath exercised His sovereignty through His sovereignty above all similitudes and indications. Therefore, He and all His creation bear witness that there is no God but He, the Great, the Most High - a testimony that is resplendent, majestic, magnificent, luminous, merciful, perfect, articulate, great, mighty, learned, powerful, pleasing, beloved, noble, generous, sovereign, possessing, manifest, hidden, preceding, succeeding, bountiful, bestowing, gracious, beauteous, inaccessible, and exalted. A testimony that filleth the pillars of the heavens with its encompassing power, and the earth and all that is therein with its rivers and all that is in them, and whatsoever lieth between them with all that is therein and thereon, that there is no God but He, the One, the Sovereign, and that the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen Him from the heights of the realm of creation and the essence of the power of invention for the station of His manifestation's establishment upon the light of the white path for the creation of all contingent things, and His establishment upon the crimson throne for the life of all atoms, that all things may testify that there is no God but He, the First, the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Creator, the Sustainer, the One Who giveth death, the One Who giveth life. There is no God but He, the One, the Judge.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Awe-inspiring, the Most Awe-inspiring. Praise be to God, there is no God but He, the Most Awe-inspiring, the Most Awe-inspiring. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen except the First One. And furthermore, I bear witness that shouldst thou cause him who believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest to fear, and fill him with awe and dread through thy dignity and power and dominion and might, and through what thou possessest of thy names and attributes which are as nothing compared to the names and attributes of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then it behooveth thee to guide thine own essence to inspire awe in thy lovers. Be thou of such character if thou findest thy Lord in grief for those who believe not in Him.

I found thy Lord in sorrow for those who believe not in Him. Beware lest thou frighten or intimidate any believing man or woman, for God hath strictly forbidden this. And verily I adjure all who are in the Bayan not to be afraid of anyone, that ye may not be afraid of Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention. Rather, be mindful of the fear of God, for this is a word from Him Whom God shall make manifest. He is the Beloved, the Feared One, the Intended, the Praised One. All things point to Him, that there is no God but He, the Worshipped One, Who created all things by His command. And verily there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.He hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Purposeful, the Most Purposeful. Say: God is more purposeful than all who have purpose. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign purpose. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Supreme Purposer, the Purposeful, the Purposed One.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth raise their voices in glorification. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He - His the dominion and the kingdom, then the might and the power, then the strength and the divinity, then the force and the sovereignty, then the rule and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: We have purposed naught but God and we all worship Him alone. Say: We have desired naught but God and we all bow down before Him alone. Say: There is no purpose for anything in the heavens or on earth or between them except God. God knoweth while ye know not.Consider from the beginning of your creation - your fathers approach not your mothers except they purpose God, and thus are ye created by God. Then reflect upon your creation after your form is fashioned in your mothers' wombs - who provideth for you except God purposeth it, and thus are ye sustained by God. Then when ye are born, your elders rear you not except they purpose God, and thus are ye reared by God. Then when ye reach the age of reason, ye seek not any religion except ye purpose God, and thus do ye all follow the religion of God. And ye seek not any worldly thing except \[...\]

Do not desire anything in this world except that through which you seek nearness to God. Say: All seek to draw nigh unto God. Therefore, in all that you nurture and elevate in your religion and worldly affairs, you aim for naught but God Who created you, sustains you, causes you to die and live again, and ordains the measure of all things. Thus do you bear witness that God is the Unseen, Whom none can comprehend save Him. And if you desire to comprehend, then comprehend Him Whom God shall make manifest. For you all, in your entirety, have aimed at none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, and you seek none but Him. This is your beginning and your end, though you seek without being aware. And when you reach your Objective, perchance you become veiled. God has granted you dominion over the earth; therefore seek not God that you might be raised up through God's Cause. How then, when your Objective comes to you, can you become veiled by that which you sought for His sake? Little do you reflect, then perceive. Say: These are the limits which you comprehend, since you seek not God in your hearts. This is a sign that has sprouted within you from the Point of the Bayan. Yet He Whom God shall make manifest is exalted above this. Say: This is God's creation - will you not reflect? Say: All that has appeared as Truth and those who have guided unto Truth from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end - all have sought God. But when they knew God, there befell them what God loved for Himself. O all things! Little do you know My purpose, then through it gain insight. For example, if you become jealous, you seek within yourselves God Who created you, and you know the attribute of jealousy and count it praiseworthy, then manifest it openly. But were you to recognize that your Objective is He Whom God shall make manifest, greater than your purpose within yourselves, and that you have become jealous for His sake, you would not manifest it if you were seeking. Similarly with all things - you love religion and the world since you seek God. How then do you seek that which God has neither willed nor purposed? We have witnessed in no one the spirit of faith except that they seek God unknowingly and unconsciously. Say: O all things! If you have sought or seek God your Lord in all things, then how is it that when I made Myself known to you - that there is no God but I, the Lord of the worlds - you neither sought Me nor seek Me? Rather you seek God within yourselves through verses that were revealed from My manifestation in the Point of the Furqan. This is the extent of your understanding and knowledge. Reflect a little on what you remember, and consider all who have occupied the thrones of reality or guided unto it - can any harm you except that which you bring upon yourselves? When God desired to make Himself known, He created as He had created before. Were you able to come between God \[...\]

Ye harm but your own selves. When God desired to make Himself known, He would create as He hath created before. Are ye able to intervene between God and His Manifestation? Say: Glory be to God! All are powerless before this. And when aforetime He desired that Moses should reveal His Lord's sign, God manifested it through His power. Say: This is of God's handiwork - ye are all together powerless before it. He is the Subduer over His creation, the Manifest over His servants, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore nullify not your purpose, neither in your return nor in your dwelling-place. For verily when ye aim to draw nigh unto God, ye turn about Him Whom God shall make manifest. Yea, ye suppose that ye are seeking God, yet when God showeth you the Manifestation of His Self, ye seek Him not. This is proof that ye have not sought God. Nothing that God hath created faileth to seek God its Lord. Say: All seek God their Lord. Say: All love God their Lord. Say: All glorify their Lord. Say: All declare the unity of God their Lord. Say: All magnify God their Lord. Say: All extol God their Lord.The Second Part of the Second UnityIn the Name of God, the Most Purposeful, the Most PurposefulGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Glory and the Might, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and Sovereignty, Thine the Rule and the Realm, Thine the Majesty and Grandeur, Thine the Force and the Action, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Presence and the Perfection, Thine the Mercy and Bounty, Thine the Authority and Justice, Thine the Likeness and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Exaltation, Thine the Greatness and Independence, Thine the Awe and the Sublimity, Thine the Might and the Inaccessibility, Thine the Power and the Transcendence, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. O my God, I and all things bear witness that we have sought none but Thee and seek none but Thee, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, in Thy Book. Therefore, O my God, ordain that I may recognize Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, that I may not be veiled from my purpose in Thyself by the Manifestation of Thy Self. For verily all that I have sought Thee for, from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end, descendeth only for the annihilation of Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, and likewise all things. How blessed then is he who knoweth his purpose, having sought none but Him from beginning to end in all his affairs. By Thy glory! Were I to possess all that is on earth, and were I to hear of the appearance of Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, I would surely seek Him, for I have not possessed that dominion except for Thee. For verily nothing is created save that it seeketh Thee - how much more when the Dawning-Place of Thine Invisibility appeareth!

By Thy glory! If someone seeks Thee -- and how much more when the Dawning-Place of Thine Invisibility appears! I have not sought Thee in my soul except through a sign of His revelation within my soul. By Thy glory, He is greater, more glorious, more mighty and more splendid. Glorified art Thou! Glorified art Thou! I have sought none but Thee and seek none but Thee. I beseech Thy forgiveness for all things, since all things are Thy creation - how then could I make them my object? Blind are the hearts that seek other than Thee and seek Thee not, and perished are the bodies that veil themselves from what seeks Thee within their souls, being veiled from Thee through the Manifestation of Thy Self. Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. Glorified art Thou! Verily I am of those who seek.Whosoever seeks Thee, O my God, must seek Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is irrevocable, for He is Thy mirror wherein none can see aught but Thee. But whoso seeks a religion and turns not unto Him - by Thy glory, he hath not sought Thee nor will return unto Thee. I beseech Thy forgiveness for all that the seekers have sought apart from those who seek Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, for these are Thy truthful servants. All others are as dead, loving while thinking they know their Object, yet from the beginning of their lives to the end they know not that which they claim to love.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Seeking, the Most Seeking! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent things, raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, rendered Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existing things, magnified Himself in His magnificence above all atoms, and shown His dominion in His sovereignty over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. I testify, and all His creation, that there is no God but He, the One sought in His Essence. All else is but the seeking of His path and His good-pleasure. Every object of search is encompassed in him who seeks the Manifestation of His Self, and every object of desire in him who finds the Dawning-Place of His Mystery. For every seeker of anything, even his own self, God is the ultimate object of his seeking. How much more then when he attains unto the Manifestation of His Self, Who is Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention! Yet he remains veiled from his Object after having sought Him, and returns not to his Beloved after having found Him. Glorified and exalted is He above what they seek without knowing, then glorified and exalted is He above what they seek without comprehending. We all seek Him. We have sought God, the Lord of the heavens and earth, Lord of all things, Lord of the visible and invisible, Lord of all worlds, inasmuch as we have sought His proof and what He hath ordained of the paths of His command and prohibition. This is by God's command, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Seeking, the Most Seeking! Praise be to God, there is no God but the Most Seeking, the Most Seeking. And verily the glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen but the First Unity. I testify that there is no object of seeking save God and no object of seeking save Him Whom He shall make manifest. Thus all that God hath commanded thee or forbidden thee is that His proof might not be sought. For example, when thou enterest the Bayan, following the paths of all things, in every path thou followest is breathed into thee the spirit of seeking the Point of the Bayan, all these paths being for seeking God\[...\]

There is no purpose save Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore, all that God hath commanded thee or forbidden thee is because His proof aspireth to no other. For example, when thou enterest into the Bayan, thou followest the paths of all things, and in every path thou followest, there is breathed into thee the spirit of the purpose of the Point of the Bayan. All these paths are for thee to seek God, and since this is impossible except through seeking the Manifestation of His Self, therefore all ways are paths of devotion that perchance through them thou mayest seek God, thy Lord. Thus on the Day of Resurrection be thou conscious that the purpose of all things is not veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, for thou mayest perchance present thyself before Him seeking God within thyself while rejecting Him to His face, though what thou hadst sought within thyself was the sign of God from the Point of the Bayan, and this is the same sign as He before Whom thou standest. How then canst thou reject Him again within thyself and remain veiled from His essence in all horizons? Similarly, understand this regarding whatsoever is called a thing, and be not heedless of this. For all those who remain veiled are veiled for this reason: each one loveth to think that he hath sought God, while God beareth witness that he hath wrongfully turned against Him. When thou turnest against Him Whom God shall make manifest, it is as though thou hast turned against God, even if in this turning thou seekest God; and if thou seekest not God, thou art an idolater. Say: This is impossible, for if thou didst not seek God in something, this would not have issued from thee. This is the path of God in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Hold fast unto it and make your remembrance, O ye who seek, contingent upon reaching Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may seek none other than Him. Say: Seek ye God through His attribute of being sought, for this is a quality essential to the court of His oneness - glorified and exalted be He above having any like unto Him, by reason of His supreme inaccessibility and exalted transcendence. Yet we, in our powerlessness and love, are all seekers of Him. And it hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Originating of originators. There is no God but He, the Most Originating of originators. Say: God is the Most Originating, above every possessor of origination. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign origination. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath been an Originator, Originating, Most Original. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then Glory and Might, then Power and Divinity, then Strength and Sovereignty, then Rulership and Humanity. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-living Who dieth not and the King Who passeth not away.

A sovereignty that fadeth not, a justice that doth not transgress, a dominion that changeth not, and an Entity from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Glorified is He Who causeth the night and the day to alternate by His command. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Can there be doubt concerning God, Who hath created the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them by His command? Nearer is He than to say unto a thing "Be" and it is. And He it is Who created you at first by His command. Will ye not then perceive? Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: He is the Manifest over His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God is more glorious than that which ye glorify. God is more exalted than that which ye exalt. God is more beauteous than that which ye beautify. God is more magnificent than that which ye magnify. God is more luminous than that which ye illumine. God is more merciful than that which ye show mercy. God is more perfect than that which ye perfect. God is more complete than that which ye complete. God is greater than that which ye make great. God is mightier than that which ye make mighty. God is more knowing than that which ye know. God is more powerful than that which ye empower. God is more pleasing than that which ye please. God is more noble than that which ye ennoble. God is more sovereign than that which ye rule. God is more possessing than that which ye possess. God is more transcendent than that which ye transcend. God is more ancient than that which ye make ancient. God is more generous than that which ye make generous. God is more shadowing than that which ye shadow. God is mightier than that which ye make mighty. God is more bountiful than that which ye make bountiful. God is more bestowing than that which ye bestow. God is more elevated than that which ye elevate. God is more subtle than that which ye make subtle. God is more seeing than that which ye see. God is more hearing than that which ye hear. God is better than that which ye deem good. God is more wise than that which ye make wise. God is more attractive than that which ye attract. God is more just than that which ye make just. God is swifter than that which ye make swift. God is more manifest than that which ye manifest. God is more compelling than that which ye compel. God is more powerful than that which ye empower. God is more hidden than that which ye hide. God is more forbearing than that which ye forbear. God is more thankful than that which ye thank. God is richer than that which ye enrich. God is more joyous than that which ye make joyous. Unto God belong all the most excellent names in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily the glory of names lieth in their being attributed by God unto His Own Self. Glorified and exalted is He above what they mention. None possesseth any existence save by the leave of God. All that are in the heavens and on earth glorify Him.

And those who are on earth and what is between them - those in the fire are for their obedience and those in the light are for their worship - all bow down before Him. His is the Most Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is independent of whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lies between them. All are His servants and all are powerless in His grasp. Say: He is the Almighty over all things. He gives life and causes death, and unto Him shall all return. Reflect ye upon your own creation. We created you from two particles and unto them shall We return you. Have ye any power to oppose God's command if ye but knew your own capacity? And if there be any power, it is from God's command - all is from God and all bow down before Him. Say: How do ye seek forgiveness from God Who created you and sustained you and causes you to die and gives you life, while ye forsake not that for which ye seek forgiveness? Say: If ye are truthful in your seeking forgiveness, then seek not forgiveness from God and commit not what God has forbidden you. This is the path of God for the God-fearing. Otherwise, were they to believe in God and what He has created and creates, verily God is Self-Sufficient, Inaccessible, Exalted. And all that has been created and will be created believes in God - verily He is Exalted, Sublime, Great. This is the glory of these and this is the abasement of those - both move and rest within their bounds. These are in the degrees of fire and those are in the degrees of paradise - both abide by His command and what is ordained in the Book. Say: Those in the fire, were they to know God, would worship Him more greatly than those who have known Him in paradise and worship Him. Do they not see how they worship God while they suppose they are worshippers? And were God to remove the veil from their insight, then all on earth would at once \[...\]

They present themselves before God and prostrate themselves. These are they who, having acted according to the truth from God, will never oppose it, and are at this moment following it. But those who were oppressed in the land, even if they should act a thousand times, would alter the limits of their own selves. Whenever a living breeze comes to them, they follow it, and whenever a lifeless breeze comes to them, they change. Say: Do not change or alter your faith in God, if you are truthful in your faith in God. This is what He has counseled you, O all things, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection you may stand firm in your path before Him Whom God shall make manifest, like a mountain upon the earth that none in all the worlds can move.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Glorified art Thou, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the earthly realm, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the face and perfection, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the stations and grandeur, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the stations and manifestation, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the power and effectiveness, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the sovereignty and might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Can there be any god besides Thee to be its possessor, or any creator besides Thee to be its ordainer? Glorified and exalted art Thou! Creation is Thy creation and command is from Thee and unto Thee, alone with no God but Thee. I worship Thee above all that Thou hast created or wilt create, I prostrate to Thee above all that Thou hast created or wilt create, I sanctify Thee above all that Thou hast created or wilt create, I magnify Thee above all that Thou hast created or wilt create, and I glorify Thee above all that Thou hast created or wilt create, taking pride in this and deriving might from that among Thy creation and servants.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, enduring, sovereign, supreme, holy, everlasting, eternal, self-dependent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Therefore, O God, do Thou preserve all Thy creation from that which Thy knowledge hath encompassed contrary to Thy good-pleasure.

All praise be to God, Who hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through the sovereignty of His creative power, and hath purified the heavens and the earth and all that is between them through the dominion of His radiant might, and hath ordained the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through the transcendent power of His eternity, and hath subdued the heavens and the earth and all that is between them through the compelling force of His omnipotence, and hath manifested the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through the independent authority of His supreme sovereignty.Unto Him be praise in the eternity of eternities, now and evermore - praise that shineth forth from the horizon of sanctity and glory, and riseth from the court of holiness and beauty; praise that blazeth and gleameth, flasheth and illumineth, and filleth all creation with the testimony that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Creating.Then He bore witness, and all His creation with Him, through the essence of transcendent glory and the abstraction of holy exaltation and the camphor of mighty grandeur and the pure crystal of glorious bounty and the primordial reality of ancient elevation, that He is the first whom God chose from the pinnacle of all possible beings and revealed Himself to him with all His names and attributes. He caused him to speak with the signs of His power like a surging, billowing ocean, and through him filled His heaven and earth like a resplendent, overflowing sea.Then through His eye He gazed upon the kingdom of His command and creation, and chose whatsoever He pleased from among the temples of His cause and creation, and ordained through him whatsoever He willed of the paths of His holy existence. All are from Him, unto Him and for Him, their Lord. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Bountiful.\[...\]

And the earth of His love in God was cleft asunder for the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Thus when there reaches you from the ray of that Name what shall hold fast your heart - for God is exalted above any who would indicate His creative essence by what pertains to His luminous glory, His supreme dominion, and His transcendent power - verily all wherewith He has sanctified His Self and revealed in the Book, or what is possible or can be named, He revealed not for the creatures to know Him Whom God shall make manifest and the paths of their servitude to God through Him. For when you observe that He is the Creator of a thing, you shall traverse the ocean of Names, and likewise if He be the Compeller, you shall traverse the ocean of Compulsion after Creation, and if He be the Forgiver of a thing, you shall traverse the ocean of Subjugation, lest you behold the Countenance of God save through the Names and Attributes in all opposing conditions. Until now none has attained to God's purpose in establishing these Names, but God has appointed a few servants for Him Whom God shall make manifest - these are they who gaze upon God their Lord as they traverse the ocean of Names and Attributes. These are the gems of the Bayan, around whom revolve night and day, and none knows their worth save God Who created them, then the Manifestation of His Self, and they glorify Him by night and day and they grow not weary. And He has four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Subjugating, the Most Subjugating. There is no God but He, the Most Subjugating, the Most Subjugating. Say: God is the Most Subjugating above all possessors of subjugation. None can escape from the dominion of His subjugating power, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily He has ever been the Subjugator, the Subduer, the Overpowering. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate those who prostrate, and praise be to God Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifies that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He gives life and causes death, then causes death and gives life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dies not, and the King Who passes not away, and the Just Who wrongs not, and the Sovereign Who changes not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapes nothing whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily He has ever been the Subjugator, the Subduer, the Overpowering. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifies that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty \[...\]

And the Ruby! Then sovereignty and the human realm! He giveth life and causeth death, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and a King that passeth not away, and Justice that oppresseth not, and a Sovereign that changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, neither aught between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God hath indeed subdued all things by His command. His is the creation and the command, both before and after. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God hath indeed subdued the sun and the moon and all the stars; they are all subdued by the command of their Lord. God is glorified in the evening and at sunrise. Say: Verily the heaven is like unto the earth - He hath subdued them both and cleft them asunder, raising this one and holding that one. Then above this He subdued the mountains, then within them He subdued the seas and rivers and whatsoever ye cultivate therein. These are the signs of God - can ye not see? Is there any god besides God, Creator of all things? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! Is there any god besides God Who subdueth things? Say: Glory be to God - all are His worshippers.Say: God subdueth what is beyond your power to subdue. Ye are not able to subdue even your own selves - how much less others! Nay, God hath subdued you and all things through what was revealed in the Bayan. Will ye not marvel? Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of might and majesty. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of countenance and beauty. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of power and action. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of mercy and bounty. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of dominion and justice. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of similitude and parables. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of stations and glory. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of grandeur and independence. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of pride and sublimity. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of might and invincibility. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of power and exaltation. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of joy and gladness. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of sovereignty and might. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of the kingdom and the realm. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of glory and omnipotence. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of power and divinity. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of strength and the Ruby. Say: Sufficient unto me is God, the Lord of sovereignty and the human realm.Say: Verily God shall indeed subdue all things. He hath power over all things. Say: Verily the person who subdueth certain things - God hath already subdued them. Can ye not see? Say: Who subdued the First One and caused them to descend upon the Point of the Bayan, and held them in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, if ye but knew! Say: Who subdueth those who enter into the Bayan \[...\]

Say: Who, save God, can command that which is revealed in the Bayan and hold it fast until the Day of Resurrection? Will ye not marvel? Say: Who, save He, hath subjected the heaven above you and the earth beneath you and the air between them both? Will ye not make haste to understand? Say: Who, save God, hath subjected the primal point in your mothers' wombs, if ye but knew? Say: Who hath subjected the Tablet within your grasp and the pens in your right hands and the ink between them? Will ye not marvel? Say: None can subject flight to your control, and ye are powerless to subject it save as He willeth. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: All these are signs from Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may bear witness that there is none other God but Him, and that this is the mirror of His Self - all bow down before Him and all prostrate themselves before Him. The Kingdom on that Day belongeth to none save God, the One, the All-Compelling, Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of all things, beside Whom there is none other God, the One, the All-Glorious. Say: In Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, if ye but knew? Say: In God's hand, Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and ye worship Him by night and by day. Say: Were the veil to be lifted from your eyes, all things would behold their beginning and their end, that they were created for Him Whom God shall make manifest. But when they learn of His manifestation, they work for other than Him and perceive it not. Say: Work not for any save God, lest ye enter into the Fire and know it not. Work ye for God Who created you and sustained you and caused you to die and gave you life and enriched you and forgave you and exalted you and abased you and strengthened you and forsook you and honored you and tested you and taught you and withheld knowledge from you and doeth for you whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the One, the All-Glorious.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Compelling, the Most CompellingGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Power, Thine the Strength and the Divinity, Thine the Force and the Ruby, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Strength and the Action, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Likeness and the Similitudes, Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Pride and the Manifestation, Thine the Glory and the Inaccessibility, Thine the Power and the Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Sovereignty and the Might, and Thine whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Command and Thy creation. Thou art He Who hath subjected all things by Thy power and made all things to prostrate before Thy face and hath caused the dwellers of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them to abide through Thy strength. Thou art resplendent in sovereignty \[...\]

Through Thy power Thou hast been invested with dominion over all the kingdoms of earth and heaven, arrayed in majesty and might, adorned with power and divinity, magnified with strength and grandeur, illumined with sovereignty and earthly dominion, made merciful through glory and majesty, perfected through radiance and beauty, exalted through the Face and perfection, glorified through power and action, made knowing through mercy and grace, empowered through authority and justice, made content through likeness and similitude, made compassionate through position and sublimity, ennobled through grandeur and independence, made sovereign through pride and majesty, given dominion through glory and invincibility, exalted through power and elevation, sanctified through joy and gladness, and made to subdue through sovereignty and might whatsoever Thou hast willed or shalt will of all that Thou hast created or shalt create. Therefore I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thyself - naught being like unto Thee before Thee - to subdue the splendor of all things and their glory, the beauty of all things and their grandeur, the light of all things and their mercy, the words of all things and their perfection, the names of all things and their might, the will of all things and their knowledge, the power of all things and their expression, the love of all things and their honor, the sovereignty of all things and their dominion, the loftiness of all things and their signs, the essence of all things and their words, the existence of all things and their favors, the grace of all things and their manifestations, the appearance of all things and their concealments, and whatsoever names of goodness Thou possessest for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and for Him Whom Thou hast manifested, and for every Sun of Truth Thou shalt manifest, whereby Thou shalt cause the manifestations before it to enter under its shadow, for all things are subdued by Thy power. I beseech Thee by Thy power whereby Thou hast subdued all things, that Thou wilt subdue unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest all that are on earth. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. And do Thou bestow upon Him, O my God, through Thy subduing power, Thy determining power, Thy compelling power, Thy mighty power, Thy transcendent power, Thy magnificent power, Thy glorious power, Thy supreme power, Thy sovereign power, and Thy invincible power. Verily, Thou art potent over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Subduing, the Most SubduingPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath subdued through His subduing power all existent things, and hath raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, and hath made Himself invincible in His invincibility above all atoms, and hath shown His dominion in His sovereignty over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness, as He Himself doth testify, that there is no God but the One, the All-Subduing, Who hath subdued all that He hath created and shall create through His essence which He hath manifested, and His abstraction which He hath made abstract, and His pristine nature which He hath made pristine, and His camphor-like quality which He hath made camphor-like, and His eternity which He hath made eternal, and His subduing power which He hath made subduing, and His creative power which He hath made creative, and His glory which He hath made glorious, and His majesty which He hath made majestic, and His beauty which He hath made beautiful, and His grandeur which He hath made grand, and His light which He hath made luminous, and His mercy which He hath made merciful, and His completeness which He hath made complete, and His perfection which He hath made perfect, and His greatness which He hath made great.

Praise be to God Who hath no peer nor equal. He is the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Compelling. From Him proceed all sovereignty, all grandeur, all knowledge, all power, all contentment, all love, all nobility, all dominion, all possession, all exaltation, all precedence, all wonderment, all generosity, all bounty, and all bestowal, and such other lofty attributes and compelling evidences. Through them He hath filled His heavens and His earth, for there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Subduing.He hath made subject unto the Seven Letters, His servant and His Word, whatsoever He hath created and will create through His power, that they who seek may recognize that He is the Object of all names and attributes, the One glorified in the kingdom of holiness, the Doer of whatsoever He willeth. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Great, the Most Exalted.In the Name of God, the Most Subduing, the Most Subduing. All praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Subduing, the Most Subduing. And verily all glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon them who resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity.I testify that God, glorified be He, hath ever been and will ever be powerful over all His names and their likenesses, and unapproachable in all His qualities and attributes. He subdueth whatsoever He willeth, howsoever He willeth, through whatsoever means He willeth.Verily thou art in the Bayan. That which God hath not permitted thee, seek not to subdue, and that which He hath permitted thee, subdue all who are not in the Bayan that thou mayest cause them to enter into the Bayan. This is from the good-pleasure of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Subduing.Know thou the science of talismans in their beginning and their end, their outward form and their inner meaning, for therein lie mighty wonders and exalted mysteries. Yet this is for the establishment of truth, not for what the desires of men may dictate. For if thou shouldst recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, thou wouldst subdue one through prostration and faith in Him. Otherwise thy knowledge and power of subduing will profit thee not. From dust thou came and to dust thou shalt return, while the Cause remaineth with God, the One, the Inaccessible.Join not two through this knowledge except through truth, nor separate them except through truth, for all things have their proper effect. Draw not nigh unto that which God hath not permitted thee. God created not this name save for the time when He Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, shall subdue whatsoever He willeth, that thou mayest witness the compelling power of God, the One, the All-Subduing. And should He compel thee, thou shalt witness the compelling power of the One, the All-Compelling. Should He forgive thee, thou shalt witness the forgiveness of God, the One, the All-Forgiving. Should He deal justly with thee, thou shalt witness the justice of God, the One, the Just. Should He show grace unto thee, thou shalt witness the grace of God, the One, the All-Bountiful.Yet move not from the Point of the Bayan, lest the mystery become difficult for thee in the kingdom of names and similitudes, for all names belong to God, exalted be His glory.

In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! All names belong to God, exalted be His glory, and He has permitted none to bear them save Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His bounty. Therefore, bear witness unto all names and attributes from that Source, and in all else, follow what God has permitted thee, for this is the path of God, the One, the Bountiful.It has four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Reckoning, the Most Reckoning. There is no God but He, the Most Reckoning, the Most Reckoning. Say: God is the Most Reckoning above all who reckon. None can escape from the dominion of His reckoning, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Reckoner, the All-Counting, the All-Sufficing.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and divinity, then the strength and sovereignty, then the rule and the earthly realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly reckon with you on the Day of Resurrection through Him Whom God shall make manifest. Will ye not, then, be God-fearing? Fear ye the Day when God will call you to account, for on that Day ye shall know. Perchance ye have worshipped from the beginning of your lives until the time when He Whom God shall make manifest reckoneth with you, and He recordeth that ye have not worshipped God and that ye shall enter the fire, because ye followed Him not and were among those who were veiled from the signs of God from His presence.And perchance one who was not of your religion at the time He maketh Himself known - say: Yea - then it shall be written for him that he hath worshipped God from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end. This is God's bounty unto the God-fearing. Yet We find not the worth of your religion to be as much as a grain of gold, for were anyone to call you to account for it, ye would reject it. But He Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die and gave you life, desireth to reckon with you on the Day of Resurrection after the number of the letter Vav hath been fulfilled, and ye reject not the signs of the One within yourselves, nor the paths of the Quran leading to its Lord, and ye think ye do good. We have seized you all \[...\]

You reckon that you do good, but We have taken account of what ye did and what We have brought you, and We have reckoned with you and taken from your hands Our possessions, and We have made you unjustified upon the earth. Say: Our possessions are Our paths in the Book, after the verses of the One in your hearts and spirits and souls and bodies. If ye reckon with yourselves in relation to Him Whom God shall make manifest as ye reckon with one another in your religion, then ye shall be God-fearing. But ye shall be called to account for the mithqal of gold which God hath commanded you to return unto Him Who shall give it unto you, that ye may reckon with yourselves regarding your faith in His presence. For if the measure of your faith be less than a mithqal of gold, then by this shall ye reckon with yourselves, yet by this shall they not reckon. And were We to establish Our authority over the earth and all that is thereon, We would assuredly call everyone to account for every general and particular thing they do in their religion and their worldly affairs. We forgive whom We will and We take to account whom We will, for verily We have knowledge of all things and We have power over all things. And if God hath not manifested the means for this, then We have already reckoned with you through Our word in the Bayan, and behold, ye know. Yet ye arise but little from your slumber. Say: If ye follow the religion of your worldly life according to God's command, then how is it that ye follow not your religion by returning unto God all that He hath created? And ye reckon that ye are religious. Nay, We have witnessed no religion in you, neither in faith nor in worldly matters, nor in this religion of yours. Perchance ye may become certain in your religion. All that ye possess hath appeared through what was revealed in the Furqan. This is the key to Our possessions with you. How is it that ye return them not unto Us while ye yourselves until now dispose of them without right? That is concerning your religion. We have left you not a single letter, and We have made lawful unto you but nineteen times nineteen letters, and We were witness over all things. In your worldly life, from the beginning of your lives unto their end, ye say with your tongues that unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them, and that unto Him all shall return. How is it then that ye dedicate not unto God yourselves and what ye possess, after ye have read and witnessed that unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them? We have not made lawful unto you even the measure of a single soul, yet behold, ye dispose without right. Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have taken account of everything in its religion and its worldly affairs, and all possess therein without right. Therefore abase not yourselves on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest by withholding aught from the Possessor of your religion and your worldly affairs. And if ye enter into the Bayan, then your religion and your worldly affairs shall be made lawful unto you until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then all that ye possess shall be forbidden unto you, unless ye act by the leave of Him Whom God shall make manifest. If anyone oweth a debt to another - even if it be five mithqals of brass, whereof a hundred equal one mithqal of silver - they must not rest in peace until they return it, for God hath willed this.

By the leave of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye do act. Should anyone be owed a debt, and were the sum inscribed five mithqals of copper, equivalent to one hundred mithqals of silver, none should rest until it is repaid, for God hath willed and commanded this. Yet ye are circumspect and vigilant in the affairs of your worldly existence, while in matters of your Faith ye take not account of yourselves before Him Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die and brought you to life. How then shall it be with your world, if ye but reflect a little? We observed not that ye presented yourselves before Us when We commanded you to do so. How then shall We reckon with you when ye present not yourselves before God? How shall God take account of you when ye recognize not the God Who created you, sustained you, and gave you life, though ye count yourselves among the righteous? Nay, God hath created naught except in truth, and this He hath desired only for the Manifestation of His Self, yet all of you remain far removed from the will of God. Ye must watch over yourselves in your worldly transactions with one another, even to the seventieth part of a mustard seed and less, keeping precise account. Yet ye place not your religious obligations upon your necks when ye have the power to discharge them. Ye must settle your accounts with one another with the utmost dispatch that ye are able. For your hearts become attached when there is an account between you and another. Ye must loose the cord of your hearts from this, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may turn unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. It is as though We behold you on the Day of Resurrection reckoning with one another regarding your worldly affairs, yet ye reckon not with Him Whom God shall make manifest in matters of your Faith and your world, nor do ye remember this. Woe unto you and the extent of your knowledge of God, your Lord! Are ye content with that which is lower in preference to that which is highest? Will ye not understand and reflect? Glorified be God above all that He hath created and will create, and all shall return unto Him. Exalted be God above all that hath been and shall be reckoned, and unto Him shall all be turned. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Forgive me when Thou takest account of me, for I possess neither Faith nor world before Thee. If Thou takest account of me by pardoning me, verily Thou art the Most Excellent of the bountiful. And if Thou seizest me for my every whole and part, verily Thou art the Most Excellent of the just. I have no refuge save in Thee, and verily Thou art the Best of reckoners. Thy decree is justice and Thy reckoning truth wherein is no wrong, and verily Thou art cognizant of all things and verily Thou art informed of all things. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Reckoning, the Most Reckoning. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Ruby, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human realm, Thine the Glory and the Majesty\[...\]

O Lord, Thine is grandeur and glory, Thine is splendor and beauty, Thine is grace and perfection, Thine are the parables and similitudes, Thine are the stations and exaltation, Thine are mercy and bounty, Thine are might and justice, Thine are power and efficacy, Thine are majesty and independence, Thine are greatness and sublimity, Thine are honor and immunity, Thine are strength and ascendancy, Thine are gladness and rapture, Thine are sovereignty and dominion, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. I testify, and all things testify, that wert Thou to call anyone to account on the Day of Judgment as one would reckon with another in this world, none could withstand Thy reckoning, how much less before the subtlety of Thy vision and the precision of Thy all-encompassing knowledge. Glorified art Thou, glorified art Thou! If someone brings something to another and experiences it, then on another day he will account for himself according to what has transpired for him. Thou hast completed the Quran and all that is therein for all Thy creation and hast granted them a respite of one thousand two hundred and sixty-seven years that they might profit by what Thou hadst given them. But when that Day of Reckoning came \[...\]

None would reject what I have brought, though all possess unjustly what they have. Though Thou art independent of them and what they possess, they are in need of Thy reckoning, just as one who deals favorably with a poor person needs the accounting of the one for whom he trades. If his owner did not reckon with him, his heart would not be at peace. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! By Thy might, I have seen none among Thy creation raise their insight to the measure of one person's trade with another. But I, O my God, will not reckon with anyone, and I commit all affairs unto Thee until the Day when Thou shalt appear and the Manifestation of Thy Self shall be revealed. Then shalt Thou reckon with all Thy creation through Thy true judgment and just decree. Besides this, I find no way.Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. I have indeed been among those who reckon. But I bear witness that my religion is from Thee and my worldly affairs are in Thy hands, both held within Thy grasp. Thou hast given them to me that I might trade with them, and I shall return my being to Thee, however I may possess it. I am as certain of this as I am of Thy oneness, and I glory in it as I glory in my faith in Thy Lordship. I fear not, nor am I afraid, for I have not been veiled from Thee in any matter, and I have not disposed of Thy wealth except by Thy leave. Thou art sufficient as a witness over me. I possess naught but myself, and Thou art sufficient as One Who encompasses all things.Should Thou manifest the causes of Thy power, then I shall reckon with all Thy creation. Otherwise, the Command is Thine, from Thee, through Thee, and unto Thee alone. There is no God but Thee. Verily, Thou art the Best of Reckoners.The Third of the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Reckoning, the Most ReckoningPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His transcendence above all contingent beings, Who hath manifested His dominion above all existing things, Who hath revealed His mastery above all created things, Who hath established His sovereignty above all that is in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath demonstrated His reckoning above all atoms.I testify, and all His creation testifies, that there is no God but Him, Who is too glorious and exalted to reckon by His Own Self the account of any of His creatures. He hath chosen a dominant Sign, an all-embracing Word, an elevated Essence, a sanctified Being, a unique Identity, and hath delegated unto it the reckoning of all things. None can revoke what He hath confirmed, and none can confirm what He hath revoked.He hath extended the reckoning of His creation from one Resurrection to another, as a token of honor unto them lest they be disgraced, and as a protection for them lest they be tried. He hath reckoned with all His creation from one Resurrection to another through the Thrones of His Manifestation. Whosoever is reckoned with in that Resurrection shall ultimately arrive at the Resurrection of Him Whom God shall make manifest. That is the Day whereon God shall reckon with all His creation through the Manifestation of His Self.O all things! From that Day forth ye shall be God-fearing. For there shall be naught but "yea" or "nay." Should ye possess all things, they would not benefit you without a "yea," and a "nay" would harm you. And should ye possess nothing, a "yea" would benefit you and a "nay" would not harm you, if ye be among those who believe in God and in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Verily, I fear not for you at the station of reckoning that He Whom God shall make manifest should pronounce "nay" \[...\]

Verily, I have feared for you in the station of reckoning, lest He Whom God shall make manifest should utter "Nay," while you and your deeds would perish and you would be unaware. Therefore, watch over your souls lest you be veiled from the Proof of your religion. Perchance you may hold fast unto that Proof on the Day of Resurrection and believe in God and His Proof. Should He reckon with you by saying "Yea," then be thankful, and should He reckon with you by saying "Nay," then seek His forgiveness, then return unto Him and repent. For verily, if after possessing all things, the word "Nay" is pronounced, it shall profit you not. How then will it be when He takes something from you that affects your hearts? How then when God takes from you all that you possess, yet you are neither affected nor do you remember?Therefore, have mercy upon yourselves, then upon your own souls. The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Reckoning, the Most Reckoning. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Reckoning, the Most Reckoning. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon those who resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen except the First Unity. And after thou hast realized the Day of Resurrection and He Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, reckons with thee by saying "Yea," say: "Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Verily, Thou art the best of the most excellent ones." And should He reckon with thee by saying "Nay," if thy spirit be not seized by the intensity thereof, thou wouldst not be human. And if thy spirit be seized within thyself and thou art able to seek forgiveness and then repent unto Him, hasten to do so. Occupy not thyself with thy deeds, for the fruit of deeds is that thou shouldst hear "Yea" on the Day of Reckoning. And verily thou hast wasted thy deeds, so with what wilt thou occupy thyself? Return unto Him and be of the penitent ones.And if anyone is to be reckoned by His command, it behooveth that the shadow of that Name be attached to thy heart if thou seest none other than God, the One, the Reckoner. And it hath four stations. The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Compelling, the Most Compelling. There is no God but He, the Most Compelling, the Most Compelling. Say: God is more compelling than every possessor of compelling power. None in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them can resist the power of His compelling sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Compeller, the Compelling, the All-Compelling. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.

Blessed is He Who holds dominion over the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. He creates what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All stand in awe of His fear. Say: Should He Whom God shall make manifest compel you against your pleasure, that indeed is God's compulsion in the Book, and ye shall now submit. Say: God's compulsion is justice in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and this is a bounty from His presence unto all worlds. Say: God hath created names that ye may through them perceive the attributes of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then unto Him shall ye return in the ocean of names and attributes. When ye witness compulsion from Him Who compels by His leave, then ye behold compulsion, and when ye see bounty from His presence by His permission, then ye witness bounty. That is the shadow of compulsion from the Sun of Truth, then the shadow of bounty from His presence which ye witness in its mirrors. All this is when ye behold from Him Whom God shall make manifest that which weigheth heavy upon your hearts, then ye shall at once submit to God's justice and resign yourselves to God's compulsion. Say: We have believed in God, the Compeller of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them, the Just, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. And when ye behold from His presence that which brings solace to your hearts, then ye shall at once give thanks, saying: This is from God's bounty, the Self-Subsisting, the Beloved. Say: All is from God and verily we submit to whatsoever appeareth from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Should He Whom God shall make manifest leave none upon the earth, that indeed would be justice - why and wherefore do ye not speak concerning God's compulsion? And should He grieve no one upon the earth, that is God's bounty - why and wherefore do ye not speak concerning God's bounty? Say: The compulsion that is attributed to God is that which is manifest in the Bayan. Therefore fear God and enter into God's religion. Say: Until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, your deeds are attributed to God, even were ye to attain the highest degrees of piety. Then if ye follow not Him Whom God shall make manifest from His presence, may your compulsion be changed to mercy from God's presence that ye may not grieve on the Day of Resurrection as champions of truth. And may your wrath be changed to compassion from God's presence that ye may not be overcome as champions of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do ye not see how God hath made the outward aspect of that Gate a blessing unto those who know not its inner reality, and the inner reality of the Gate a mercy unto those who have believed in God and His signs and who submit to God's command? Likewise shall ye assume in all your attributes that which attracts the hearts of all beings. If ye exercise outward compulsion, inwardly ye show mercy, and if ye show outward mercy, inwardly ye take hold of the thread of compulsion.

And if ye show outward mercy, in your inmost heart ye seize the thread of compulsion; and if ye manifest outward wrath, in your inmost heart ye spread forth the waters of life; and if ye show love outwardly, then in your inmost heart ye reveal but a drop of anger. All this ye do amongst yourselves, but before God ye are all as ye were on the day He created you. Therefore, manifest not before Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor before them who shall return unto Him, aught save that wherein both ye and they would find delight. Adorn yourselves with the attributes of your Lord and manifest not \[...\]

All constraint belongs to those who believe in the religion of God. And thus it is with all your attributes, if ye be of those who fear God in His path. Unto God belongeth the power to constrain all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. God is the All-Compelling, the Compeller, the Constrainer. Say: Should He Whom God shall make manifest constrain you through His command, then unto the Day of Resurrection shall ye ascend through His constraint. And should He ordain mercy from His presence, then unto the Day of Resurrection shall ye be raised up in His mercy. Therefore commit no deed whereby ye may be justly constrained, while ye perceive it not, and grieve no one lest ye be overcome, while ye witness it not.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Verily, Thou art the Compeller of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. All that hath been created and shall be created dost Thou constrain in truth. Verily, Thou art the Most Compelling of compellers. Do Thou raise up servants who shall, through Thy power, constrain all who are on earth, that they may enter into Thy Faith, and then show mercy unto them.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Then all that hath been created and shall be created dost Thou show mercy unto in truth. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. Do Thou raise up servants who shall show mercy from Thy presence unto those who truly believe in the Bayan. And make these the manifestations of the power of Him Whom God shall make manifest, who shall leave none on earth who believe not in Him except that they shall prevail over them. And these are the manifestation of mercy unto those who believe in God and His signs, and who are assured of the manifestation of His Self on the Day of Resurrection.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Compelling, the Most CompellingGlorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divine Essence, Thine the Strength and the Substance, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Likeness and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Authority and the Justice, Thine the Force and the Effectiveness, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Awe and the Revelation, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast ever been the Compeller of compellers, the Subduer of subduers, the Most Severe of the severe, the Supreme of the supreme, the Most Powerful of the powerful, the Most Triumphant of the triumphant, the Most Forbidding of forbidders. O my God! In Thy constraint there is no injustice, and in Thy subjugation there is no deviation. Therefore I beseech Thee by Thy might and Thy holiness that Thou wilt, through Thy bounty, make me independent of all else but Thee, and through Thy grace, shield me from Thy subjugation, and through Thy favor, protect me from Thy justice, and through Thy pardon, preserve me from Thy grasp, and through Thy generosity, save me from Thy vengeance, for all are poor before Thee \[...\]

In Thy bounty, withhold Thy vengeance, for all are impoverished before Thee and none possesseth anything save through Thee. Thou hast ever been the Subduer over all contingent beings, the Manifest over all created things, the Compeller over all existences, the Mighty over all atoms, and the Sovereign over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. O God! Thou shalt raise up servants for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, whose hearts Thou hast created from the mountains of Thy might, that they may, through Thy indomitable power and transcendent sovereignty, prevail over those who believe not in Him. Create within them, through Thy mercy and loving-kindness, guides to His faith and love, and witnesses to His nearness and presence, and make them manifestations of Thy sovereignty over those who are veiled and of Thy mercy towards the believers. For verily Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, the Living, the Self-Sustaining, the All-Ruling, the All-Subduing, the Holy, the Everlasting, the Independent, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Through the sovereignty of Thy might, Thou hast bestowed upon me a wondrous Temple that existed not before, and a sphere of glory the like of which hath never been, and Tablets inscribed in the Book, and inaccessible Tablets manifest in the hands of the servants, as a bounty from Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Subduing, the All-Bountiful. This is what Thou hast manifested through my influence among Thy servants. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee, the One, the Compeller.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Compelling, the Most CompellingPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself through the sovereignty of His might above all contingent beings, and hath prevailed through the dominion of His power over all created things, and hath taken possession through the authority of His strength over whatsoever He willeth among all existences, and hath established His rule through the dominion of His sovereignty over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath demonstrated His power through the sovereignty of His might over all atoms. All His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the One, the Compeller - a testimony resplendent, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, luminous, merciful, perfect, eloquent, mighty, glorious, efficacious, decisive, powerful, well-pleasing, loving, noble, sovereign, royal, and sublime. A testimony whose beginning indicateth His primacy, whose end evidenceth the finality of its Educator, whose outward aspect attesteth the manifestness of its Originator, and whose inward reality proveth the hiddenness of its Creator. A testimony that filleth the pillars of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them: There is no God but Him, the One, the All-Luminous.Then He and all His creation bear witness that He Whom God shall make manifest is the Sun of His Revelation, the Mystery of His Concealment, the Essence of His Secret, the Camphor of His Manifestation, the Substance of His Cause, the Embodiment of His Creation, and the Glory of His Self. God hath chosen Him for the station of His Own Self from the most exalted summit of holiness of all contingent beings, and hath delegated to Him the command of all things inasmuch as He desireth naught but what God desireth. The acknowledgment of His sovereignty hath been joined with the acknowledgment of His oneness\[...\]

And He hath joined recognition of His authority with recognition of His oneness, and hath made that which descendeth upon Him the Guardian over all that hath been revealed, and that which appeareth from His presence concerning the measures of all things the Guardian over whatsoever He hath manifested through all that He hath created and will create. For through Him is God worshipped and unified, through Him is God described and magnified, through Him is God sanctified and praised, through Him is God exalted and glorified, and through Him are the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them filled. There is no God but Him, the One, the Manifest.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Compelling, the Most Compelling. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Compelling, the Most Compelling. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. And furthermore, I testify that the compelling power of God is justice and the justice of God is truth, and this appeareth not save at the dawning of the compelling power of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may witness that He is justice and may testify concerning His justice that it is truth, for God hath created the names that thou mayest witness in the Countenance of Truth their attributes in every name, description, meaning and capacity, and that thou mayest attain unto that Source of Truth in whatsoever thou art able to set forth in the tablets of form.Then bear witness that God, glorified be He, hath given the Word of the Bab the number of "Ha" in utterance, and the number of "Ha" following the first in verses, communions, sermons, commentaries, and whatsoever God hath manifested through His Proof from among words in foreign tongues. Then there are the effects which have appeared in His handwriting: the pentacles, books, tablets, and graceful missives, whether they be according to the pattern of the five effects or one of them. This is of His grace unto His servants. O all things, be ye thankful unto Me!And it hath four stages. The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Patient, the Most Patient. There is no God but He, the Most Patient, the Most Patient. Say: God is more patient than any possessed of patience. None can escape from the dominion of His patience's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been patient, long-suffering, and forbearing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in prostration.And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are His worshippers. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who is not ungenerous, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.

Blessed is He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed is He, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: God, verily, granteth you respite from one Revelation unto another that ye may, during your prolonged reprieve, make ready your souls for the meeting with your Lord. Yet from one Revelation unto another ye remain heedless. We granted respite unto the people of the Qur'an for the number of the name of Grace in the Book of God, but We witnessed no shame among the people of Islam throughout their reprieve. Rather, their wretchedness and their veils grew more severe. Therefore fear God, then be ye of them that fear Him. For the length of your night is for your own selves, but on the Day of Resurrection ye shall act. Who else would grant you such respite as this, did ye but know?Say: Nothing can frustrate God from hastening your destruction, yet He granteth you respite that He may intensify your fire. Then will He seize you by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: Fire is extinguished at the mention of God, so how is it that ye are not extinguished on the Day of Resurrection before Him Whom God shall make manifest? Say: Should He Whom God shall make manifest grant you respite and ascend to heaven saying "No," then all your essences and deeds would be rendered void. Therefore fear God in the days of your respite that ye may attain unto the command of God. We have granted respite from the beginning of this Cause until now, and We have dealt with you through the days that ye might feel some shame and remember.Then shall We seize you with a trial, and ye shall not be able to turn back the decree of God. O all things! While ye have power to do good, acquire it, for after your respite in your Cause, ye may not be able to acquire aught. Say: God feareth not the passing of time, and granteth you respite only that He may seize you with a severe seizing. Verily He is the All-Compelling, the Manifest, the Sublime.Say: God loveth that His attribute of clemency be made manifest in the Book which ye reveal one to another. Make ye no stipulations in the course of your affairs, and should anyone seek respite from you, grant it forthwith. This is what God hath prescribed for you, O people of knowledge and wisdom, that ye may fear God on the Day of Resurrection. Whosoever seeketh respite from another, it is incumbent according to the Book to grant it, even if he be not a believer. This is the path of God, both before and after, in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that lieth between them, O all things, follow ye it!Say: God granteth you respite from one Resurrection unto another. How is it that ye grant not respite one to another even for numbered days? Should anyone grant respite to another as a bounty from himself, God will grant him a goodly provision in the life to come and in this life, and will multiply what is written for him from His presence. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. God hath prescribed for him who seeketh aught from another and testifieth that he is unable to repay it, that he should not be asked \[...\]

God bears witness that if anyone asks to be granted respite in the path of God, none should refuse it. Rather, God will grant him twice what he sought to take from him - nay, a thousand times more as a bounty from His presence in the Book. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Exalted. But you are ashamed to return anyone's property to its owner and cannot bear to wait even a little while, though you should return it immediately. God has prescribed for you in your journeying and your dwelling, in your religion and your worldly affairs, and in your latter and former states, the paths of truth from His presence, that you may be grateful in the religion of God. Grant respite to all who seek your protection, even if they be not of your religion, as a bounty from God upon you and them. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Most Excellent. Say: Through this they enter into the religion of God, and you should not grieve about this in your religion. Whosoever seeks protection with another and is not granted it shall enter the fire, even if he has not entered the Bayan. O all things! You are awaiting the Cause of God. Whosoever seeks your protection, protect them, that God may protect you from difficulties on the Day of Resurrection when all shall be brought before Him. Say: Whosoever desires respite from another or seeks protection with another who grants it - for these two are manifested in the Bayan - these two shall enter Paradise and be encompassed by mercy, even if they were not among the believers. All this is so that on the Day of Resurrection you may not judge except with truth. If anyone seeks your protection and asks you for respite, show them from the Book of God and do not grieve them. To God belongs all respite in the kingdom of the heavens and earth and what lies between them. God is the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. God is the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the All-Informed. God is the All-Wise, the Judge, the Most Wise. God is the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Almighty. God is the King, the Owner, the Sovereign. He causes whomsoever He wishes to enter His mercy. Verily, He is the Most Merciful, the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Patient, the Most PatientGlorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, and Thine is the Might and the Power, and Thine is the Strength and the Sovereignty, and Thine is the Force and the Grandeur, and Thine is the Rule and the Realm, and Thine is the Glory and the Majesty, and Thine is the Beauty and the Grace, and Thine is the Countenance and the Perfection, and Thine are the Symbols and the Examples, and Thine are the Stations and the Magnificence, and Thine is the Mercy and the Bounty, and Thine is the Authority and the Justice, and Thine is the Greatness and the Independence, and Thine is the Awe and the Sublimity, and Thine is the Might and the Inaccessibility, and Thine is the Power and the Exaltation, and Thine is the Joy and the Gladness, and Thine is the Dominion and the Power. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, the Everlasting Sovereign, the Supreme, the Holy, the Eternal, the Endless. Thou hast never taken unto Thyself a consort\[...\]

One, Single, Self-Subsisting, Alone, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Most Holy, Eternal, Everlasting! Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and there is no partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them according to Thy decree. By Thy will Thou hast formed all things and shaped them according to Thy design. Thou hast ever been supreme over all created things, manifest above all existing things, inaccessible above all beings, exalted above all creatures, and transcendent above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, for verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Sanctified are Thy names and exalted are Thy likenesses, and there is nothing that can be likened unto Thee. Thou hast ever granted Thy servants respite that they might turn to Thee from one Manifestation unto another. How sublime is Thy forbearance toward Thy creation and how glorious are Thy gifts unto Thy servants! Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die by Thy power. Thy forbearance and patience proceed from naught else but Thy grace and mercy. Thou hast ever been powerful over all things and manifest above all things. Only he who fears losing something hastens in a matter, but glorified and exalted art Thou above having anything escape Thy grasp or flee from the right hand of Thy sovereignty. Glorified and exalted art Thou! How great is Thy forbearance from Manifestation to Manifestation that Thy creatures might live and worship Thee in every Revelation according to Thy reality. Then throughout their nights and in the days of Thy forbearance they follow Thy commandments and are strengthened by what Thou hast ordained for them of Thy ways and Thy prevailing wisdom from among those who know Thee, and Thy binding command from those who serve Thee. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! Creation is Thine and command is from Thee and unto Thee alone, no partner hast Thou. Verily Thou art the All-Bestowing, the Most Exalted, the Inaccessible. Verily Thou art the Munificent, the Most High, the Generous. Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the All-Ruling, the Great. Verily Thou art the Peace-Giving, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Verily Thou art the All-Compelling, the Irresistible, the Most Powerful. The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Forbearing, the Most Forbearing. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath prevailed in His dominion above all existing things, Who hath appeared in His manifestation above all created things, Who hath demonstrated His might above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath shown His power above all atoms. He is the One exalted above every description and likeness, and the Single One sanctified from every mention and comparison. He hath made Himself known through Himself - verily there is no God but He, the One, the Most Forbearing. He hath chosen an impregnable essence for Himself and then revealed Himself to it through it \[...\]

He hath indeed known Himself by Himself, for verily there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Forbearing. He hath chosen for Himself an exalted Essence, then revealed Himself unto it through it, and cast into its identity the likeness of His Own Being. Thus did His deeds appear through it, and His manifestations became evident, and His likenesses shone forth, and His words were uttered, and His revelations were exalted. He therefore called Himself and all His creation to witness that there is none other God but Him, and that the Seven Letters are His servant and His Word. Through Him hath He granted respite to all things from their Resurrection unto their Resurrection, and hath willed, then commanded forbearance in His earthly kingdom as a token of grace unto His weak creatures and as a kindness to the inhabitants of His realm, that all His servants might thereby give thanks unto God and bear witness at all times, before all times, and after all times, that there is none other God but Him, the Sanctified, the Exalted.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Forbearing, the Most Forbearing. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Forbearing, the Most Forbearing. And verily all glory be from God upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught can be seen except the First One. I moreover bear witness that all names in their station are like unto the Most Exalted Names. For instance, when thou art compelled to seek forbearance, then nothing will benefit thee except forbearance, and no other station of the Names will profit thee. Look, therefore, only to that which is manifest in the Names, and that which is hidden within them, and that which is first among them, and that which is last upon them. For verily He Who created thee is He Who sustained thee, and He Who sustained thee is He Who caused thee to die, and He Who caused thee to die is He Who gave thee life, and He Who gave thee life is He Who granted thee forbearance, and He Who granted thee forbearance is He Who exalted thee. There is none other God but Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that are in the heavens and on earth and between them glorify Him. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Forbearing.Should anyone grant forbearance in His path, God will assuredly manifest it, for this is among the attributes of God's forbearance, exalted be His glory. Abandon not this attribute, nor the attribute of him who seeketh protection, for both are from the might of God, the One, the Jealous, and from the loftiness of God, the One, the Great. Whosoever seeketh thy protection, grant it unto him, and whosoever desireth forbearance from thee, grant him forbearance, for verily He hath commanded thee thus, and He is indeed the All-Forbearing, the Forbearing, the Most Forbearing.And He hath four stations. The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Sending, the Most Sending. There is none other God but Him, the Most Sending, the Most Sending. Say: God sendeth above all sending. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can resist the sovereignty of His sending. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Sender, the Most Sending, the All-Sending. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. Praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens glorify \[...\]

Praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them doth glorify. Say: All are humbly submissive unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who oppresseth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be unto Thee, O God, my Lord! Send down, on this Night of Independence, Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and the exponents of His Cause, through all the good that Thy knowledge encompasseth. Verily, Thou art the All-Encompassing, and Thou hast power over all things.O God! Do Thou aid those who, on the Day of Resurrection, will help Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. Exalt them, enrich them, strengthen them, and grant them dominion over all the world. O God! Bring low those who believe not in Him and seize them with a mighty seizing.

Say: He will assuredly send whom He willeth, and they shall be sent by God's leave.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted.Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and the divine realm, Thine the strength and the ruby, Thine the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the face and perfection, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the power and deed, Thine the might and justice, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the stations and glory, Thine the grandeur and independence, Thine the awesomeness and majesty, Thine the might and inaccessibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! This is a night which Thou hast magnified, honored, preferred, exalted, beautified, glorified and elevated, and named it the Night of Independence. Therein Thou hast opened the gates of Thy heaven and permitted the angels to raise unto Thee the voices of Thy servants, and commanded the angels of the Throne to call out to those on earth: "Call ye upon God Who created you and sustained you and caused you to die and gave you life, that ye may glorify Him in like manner."O my God! I truly call upon Thee from all things \[...\]

O my God! I call upon Thee, seeking from all things Thy bounty, the abundance of Thy generosity, Thy favors, Thy grace, Thy gifts, Thy beneficence, Thy tender mercies, Thy compassion and Thy bestowals. O Lord! Elevate the stations of those who have ascended unto Thee with their hearts, their spirits, their souls and their bodies. O God!

That is the night when the angels descend upon them and command those on earth to stand before them. O God! Exalt the remembrance of Thy loved ones, their first and their last, their outer and their inner reality, and elevate their stations to the highest chambers and the most exalted throne. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.The Third in the Third. In the name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest! May the most resplendent glory of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. Then may the most sublime majesty of God be upon thee, and His most magnificent grandeur be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most luminous light of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade.

And may the most penetrating knowledge of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most potent decree of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most pleasing utterance be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most honorable honor of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most enduring sovereignty of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most excellent dominion of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most exalted loftiness of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the most ancient \[...\] of God be upon thee and upon those who seek shelter beneath thy shade. And may the signs of God be upon thee \[...\]

And verily among the signs of God unto thee and unto those who seek shelter beneath thy shade - the most glorious of them - God and His angels and those endowed with knowledge have ever invoked blessings upon thee concerning the letters of thy self and upon those who have ascended unto thee through their love for thee. And God will surely bestow His grace upon those who uphold not thy rights and the rights of those who have ascended unto God through thy truth. Neither thou nor those with thee were ever abased, for glory belongeth unto God and unto His Messenger and unto those who have believed in God and His signs, and who ascend in His good-pleasure. And God will surely cause to enter into paradise whosoever offereth unto thee a service or expendeth aught in thy path, after having recognized thy right and thy station before God, thy Lord. And as to those who dwell beneath thy shade, God regardeth them with the eye of His love and will surely increase His bounty unto them in all things. Grieve not, for ye shall behold in the chambers of your paradise that which ye desire of God's grace, and God will show you those who believed not in Him as though non-existent upon the earth. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Mighty.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Sending, the Most Sending. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Sending, the Most Sending. And verily all glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that there is no sender save God, exalted be His glory, and God hath sent no Messenger nor revealed any Book except that all believe in the Tree of Truth from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment. This is the fruit of the Messengers and the Books, where the Tree of Truth is not seen alone upon that mountain, though all imagine themselves to be doing what pleaseth God. When thou art given the essence of knowledge, bear witness that the fruit of all the Messengers and all the Books is that thou shouldst worship God and associate naught with Him. And this is impossible unless thou believest in Him Whom God shall make manifest and associate none with Him. And submerge not thyself in seas that profit thee not, for what God hath intended through all the Messengers and Books is this, and all claim this, yet all are liars save those who have entered the Bayan and are assured of God's Cause.The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Seeing, the Most Seeing. There is no God but He, the Most Seeing, the Most Seeing. Say: God is more seeing than all possessed of sight. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign sight. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Seeing, the All-Perceiving, the Most Seeing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God, Whom doth glorify whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the kingdom \[...\]

Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the divine realm, then the strength and the celestial realm, then the dominion and the realm of creation. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Whose rule passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Potentate Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will show you His signs as He willeth. Will ye not cease to hasten? Say: God cannot be seen nor comprehended by anyone. Glorified and exalted is He above what they mention. And all that ye have witnessed of the meeting with God - that is the manifestation of His Self. Do ye not, then, believe with certainty in the Cause of God?Say: God hath created for you no beauty like unto this, if ye would but believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord on the day of His manifestation. Say: God is not pleased that any should gaze upon the countenance of the Manifestation of His Self save those eyes that behold Him with the eye of God, and who witness in Him the revelation of God, and who witness in Him the inner meaning, and who witness in Him the glory of God, and who witness in Him beauty, and who witness in Him the grandeur of God, and who witness in Him the light of God, and who witness in Him the mercy of God, and who witness in Him the words of God, and who witness in Him the perfection of God, and who witness in Him the names of God, and who witness in Him the might of God, and who witness in Him the knowledge of God, and who witness in Him the power of God, and who witness in Him the utterance of God, and who witness in Him the love of God, and who witness in Him sovereignty, and who witness in Him the dominion of God, and who witness in Him that which is of God, and who witness in Him the signs of God, and who witness in Him the loftiness of God, and who witness in Him the justice of God, and who witness in Him the nearness of God, and who witness in Him the Cause of God, and who witness in Him His most beautiful names.Say: All these are names whereby ye seek to understand Him, but God is sanctified above all that ye mention. God hath indeed purified and sanctified the Manifestation of His Self from every similitude that ye mention. Say: Naught shall be seen in Him except God, and all in their degrees before God do glorify Him. Make ye your knowledge into deeds if ye wish to benefit therefrom. When ye behold in Him the sovereignty of God, then look not upon anything else on earth, for this matter shall endure until the Day of Resurrection.

All in their stations before God do glorify Him. Make ye your knowledge your deeds, if ye love to benefit. When ye behold therein the sovereignty of God, then ye look not unto all that is on earth. This Command endureth until the Day of Resurrection, and when it is revealed, all who are on earth must follow it until the Day of Resurrection. Do ye not see? Yet a mighty command runneth upon the earth by God's bidding so long as those who hold sway in His dominion do so without right. How then do ye not recognize such sovereignty? We found not in that creation any spirit, and they remember but little. Yet those endowed with knowledge, were they to behold Him Whom God shall make manifest on earth, would testify that His Cause is exalted above all on earth, for all creation is before Him and all bow down unto Him. Were the veil to be removed from their vision, then would all prostrate themselves before Him. This is the sovereignty of God, beneath whose shadow all on earth shall seek shelter by virtue of its worthiness until the Day of Resurrection, and there is no repelling it from God. What aileth you that ye seek sovereignty which deriveth its authority from God's Cause without right, yet turn not unto Him Who created you and His Command which endureth until the Day of Resurrection with no repelling it, if ye would but remember? Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Splendid, the Most Splendid, the Resplendent. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Majestic, the Most Majestic, the Glorious. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Beautiful, the Most Beautiful, the Beauteous. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Great, the Most Great, the Magnificent. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Luminous, the Most Luminous, the Light-Giving. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Unto God belongeth the words of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Perfect, the Most Perfect, the Perfecting. Unto God belongeth the perfection of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Perfect, the Most Perfect, the Perfecting. Unto God belong the names of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Great, the Most Great, the Greatest. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Mighty, the Most Mighty, the Almighty. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Knowing, the Most Knowing, the Omniscient. Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Powerful, the Most Powerful, the Omnipotent. Unto God belongeth the utterance of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Pleasing, the Most Pleasing, the Well-Pleased. Unto God belong the evidences of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Loving, the Most Loving, the Best Beloved. Unto God belongeth the nobility of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Noble, the Most Noble, the Exalted. Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Possessing, the Most Possessing, the Supreme Sovereign.

By God! The Lord is the Master, the King, and unto God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. God is the Most Exalted, the Most High, the Most Sublime. You shall indeed attain on that Day - the Day of Independence - when your possessions shall be multiplied in this first life, and then your good deeds in the life to come. You are preparing yourselves for the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, not in the manner of those who have recited the prayers of the Manifestation. The letter Vav has passed while you were all sleeping. You hear the Command of God but do not comprehend, nor do you believe. Therefore, understand and then believe in God's Command, else you shall surely die like all the nations upon the earth and then enter into the fire.Say: The paradise of each Manifestation is greater than the paradise revealed by God before. Do you not then give thanks for God's bounties? Say: The fire of each Manifestation is greater than the previous one. Do you not then fear God's Command? This is so you may witness that those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest occupy no more exalted station before God than those who entered the Bayan and upon whom you invoke blessings. And those who do not believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest occupy no lower station than those who did not enter the Bayan, nay, than all that is on earth. Indeed their fire is greater. Therefore fear God on the Day of God's Manifestation regarding those who believe not in Him, for that is the fire with which you are promised. And if it be your own souls, then fear them, for you shall be consumed therein and shall not see, just as God consumed the first and the second and those who were with them. Thus will God consume you if you remain veiled from the presence of God.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Unto Thee belong the Kingdom and the Dominion, unto Thee belong Might and Omnipotence, unto Thee belong Power and Divinity, unto Thee belong Strength and Glory, unto Thee belong Sovereignty and the human realm, unto Thee belong Honor and Majesty, unto Thee belong Grandeur and Beauty, unto Thee belong the Face and Perfection, unto Thee belong the Likeness and Examples, unto Thee belong the Stations and Glory, unto Thee belong Mercy and Grace, unto Thee belong Authority and Justice, unto Thee belong Power and Action, unto Thee belong Greatness and Independence, unto Thee belong Pride and Manifestation, unto Thee belong Glory and Invincibility, unto Thee belong Strength and Exaltation, unto Thee belong Joy and Gladness, unto Thee belong Sovereignty and Power, and unto Thee belong whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation.Thou hast described in a verse of Thy Book - and Thy Word is the Truth - "Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth all vision; and He is the Subtile, the All-Informed." Yea, there is no doubt in this, that Thou in Thine Essence cannot be seen nor comprehended, for in every manifestation there is after it Thy invisibility, and none hath access to that. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! Then Thou hast described Thyself in another verse and promised all Thy creation to meet Thee. There is no doubt that this is the meeting with the Manifestation of Thyself on the Day of Resurrection.

Thou hast promised all Thy creatures to meet Thee, and there is no doubt that this is the meeting with the Manifestation of Thyself on the Day of Resurrection, and those who, by Thy leave, guide unto Him from His presence. Therefore, O my God, enable all Thy creatures to attain unto this, for Thou hast not created anything except for this purpose - that it may behold Thee in that which Thou lovest and with which Thou art well-pleased. Glory be unto Thee! Exalted art Thou! I know not, nor can any know, a Resurrection like unto this Resurrection, and verily I am ashamed to make mention of any limitation of that creation. Glory be unto Thee! Exalted art Thou! Glory be unto Thee! Magnified art Thou! Therefore, O my God, train the people of the Bayan for the meeting with Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, prostrate before Thee. Verily, Thou art the best of trainers.Thou hast ordained a connection between every seer and the seen, yet Thou hast sanctified Thyself from all connection. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee, the One, the All-Seeing. Thou seest but art not seen, and verily Thou art in the Most Exalted Horizon, the Cleaver of the grain and the date-stone. Unto Thee belongeth whatsoever is in the highest heavens and the lowest earth, and in the Hereafter and the former time.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Seeing, the Most Seeing. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath glorified Himself in His glory above all existing things, and hath magnified Himself in His grandeur above all created things, and hath manifested Himself in His manifestation above all atoms, and hath made Himself victorious in His victory above all who are in the kingdom of earth and heaven. I testify, and all His creation doth testify, that there is no God but He, the One in Essence, the One in Attributes, the One in Names, and the One in Similitudes. There is no God but He, the Great, the Most High.I testify, and all His creation doth testify, with a testimony purified from the turbidity of allusions and cleansed from the dregs of doubts - a testimony that findeth stability in the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest and goeth not forth unto aught else, that it may thereby reach unto its Originator, its Creator, its Nurturer, and its Essence - that there is no God but He, and there is nothing like unto Him, and He is the One, the All-Seeing. He seeth all that He hath created and will create through His subtle vision, yet nothing seeth Him, neither before nor after, neither in heaven nor on earth, nor what is between them. Verily, there is no God but He, the One, the Glorious.I testify on that Day, the Day of Independence, that He, glorified be He, since the meeting with His Essence was impossible for His creation, hath chosen His resplendent Essence, His abstract Being, His crystalline Manifestation, His sublime Reality, His exalted Entity, and hath made the meeting with It to be the meeting with Himself for all His creation. Yet all His servants have veiled themselves from That, and have confined Him to a mountain where none can see Him save one of His chosen ones. This is what God hath done for His creation, and this is what the creation hath withheld from the Cause of their Lord. What fire is more intense than this for all that hath been and will be created, when they act thus?The Fourth in the Fourth.

In the name of God, the Most Seeing, the Most Seeing! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no god, the Most Seeing, the Most Seeing! Verily, the Glory from God is upon the First One and upon those who resemble that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that the meeting with the Essence of God, exalted be His glory, is impossible due to the loftiness of His sanctity and the sublimity of His might. He hath chosen for this station the Sun of Truth and hath made the creation of that shadow in every Dispensation. When He created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and nurtured all things from the first innovation unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, then the portion of all existence was to meet Muhammad over twenty-three years, and this was the meeting with God in the primary reality. Then when He ascended and the creation of the night was realized, the meeting with His guides became His meeting in secondary reflection. Then when those guides ascended and the Cause reached unto the crimson pillar, the meeting became with him who speaketh on behalf of God and His Messenger and the witnesses of His Messenger with pure truth, wherein his own desires have no share. This then is the meeting with the Sun of Truth through infinite veils which none comprehendeth save God. Not all who claim this are truthful, for on the Day of Resurrection countless are those who make such claims, all of whom are, in the sight of God, pure nothingness. God loveth not to mention them, how much less to attribute their meeting through quaternary veils to His own Self. Thus, after the long night and the passing of the numbered term, God hath caused to shine upon all created things, past and future, through the dawning of the manifestation of His Self. The portion of that creation is in the days of His manifestation, and when He setteth, none hath access to true knowledge save by holding fast unto those who hold fast to the guides of the Bayan and its ordinances, that ye may attain their meeting through reflection of reflection, if ye find them holding fast to the laws of their Lord's Book and being God-fearing in their ways.

In the name of God, the Most Death-giving, the Most Death-giving! There is no God but He, the Most Death-giving, the Most Death-giving! Say: God is Death above all possessors of death. None can escape from the dominion of His sovereign death, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Death-giver, the Death-bestower, the Death-wielder.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Force and the Spiritual Kingdom, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and in what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. He is the One Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be!" and it is. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but He, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Single One, the Inaccessible, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is the One Who standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and bearing witness to what it earneth. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. He is the One Whom all in the heavens and on earth and in what lieth between them glorify. There is no God but He, the Living, the Self-Subsisting.Say: He is the Truth, He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him all shall return. Unto God belongeth all that He hath created and will create of everything, and all stand firm through His command.Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Kingdom and Dominion. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Might and Omnipotence. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Power and the Divine Realm. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Force and the Spiritual Kingdom. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Glory and Majesty. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of Countenance and Beauty. Say: Praise be to God, Who, there is no God but He, the Lord of the Face \[...\]

Say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of countenance and perfection. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of power and action. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of might and justice. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of similitude and parables. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of stations and majesty. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of grandeur and independence. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of glory and magnificence. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of honor and invincibility. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of joy and gladness. And say: Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the One possessed of sovereignty and power.Say: Verily God hath power to create all things, both before and after. His is the most exalted similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Best-Beloved. And unto God belongeth the most resplendent similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Most Glorious, the Best-Beloved.Say: Verily God shall grant you relief. Say: Glory be to God above what they describe. Say: Verily God shall deliver you from every sorrow. Is there any god besides God who can deliver you from your sorrow? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe. Say: Verily God created you and sustaineth you and causeth you to die and giveth you life. If He willeth He can make your lifespan the length of ages, and if He willeth but numbered years, and if He willeth but numbered hours, and if He willeth in less than the twinkling of an eye, and likewise in all that appeareth from His presence. Will ye not then be thankful?Say: Verily God hath sent all the Messengers, every one of them, that ye should worship none but God and that ye should be believers in the signs of God. Say: Verily God hath sent down the Books in truth that ye should worship none but God and that ye should be among those who are certain of that which God hath revealed. Say: This is the essence of essences from all the Messengers and the essence of essences from all the Books. All of you bear witness to Him Whom God shall make manifest. In His grasp is all that hath been created and shall be created, and ye shall judge with truth from His presence.Say: All things are in His grasp. He ordereth the affairs of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them as He pleaseth by His command. His is the most exalted similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God; there is \[...\]

There is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the heavenly realm, Thine is might and dominion, Thine is power and divinity, Thine is strength and glory, Thine is sovereignty and the human realm, Thine is honor and majesty, Thine is the countenance and beauty, Thine is the face and perfection, Thine are the symbols and parables, Thine is power and action, Thine is mercy and grace, Thine is authority and justice, Thine are the stations and grandeur, Thine is greatness and independence, Thine is glory and radiance, Thine is might and protection, Thine is power and exaltation, Thine is joy and gladness, Thine is sovereignty and dominion, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been sanctified through might and permanence, and Thou hast subdued Thy servants through death and evanescence. Glorified art Thou! None besides Thee can cause death to anything, and none but Thee can give life to anything. No soul is taken except by Thy leave, and no spirit is severed from anything except by Thy command. Thou art the One Who causeth death, there is no God but Thee; Thou art the One Who giveth life, there is no God but Thee.Glorified art Thou, O my God! How many Dispensations hast Thou manifested unto them through themselves, making them the Throne of Thy Revelation, causing them to die through Thy power and raising them unto Thee through Thy sovereignty. Then no mention remaineth of them, how much less of their religion, their people, their laws - though all their hearts are prostrate before Thee in submission, devoted, remembering, glorifying, supplicating that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is what Thou hast created and wilt create. Thou givest life and causeth death, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all names. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou hast ever been All-Knowing, All-Powerful, All-Wise.Glorified art Thou, O my God! All things perish save Thee, and all things die except Thee. Therefore, O God, remember me through the Thrones of Thy Revelation when there remaineth no mention of me, my Book, and those created through me, just as Thou didst remember the Thrones of Thy Revelation from the beginning that hath no beginning in that Dispensation by Thy leave. For I witness with mine own eyes that before me there was no trace of my house of manifestation, and the house of manifestation after me - how, O my God, will be the state of those who were guided by me? By Thy might! Let none of them remain except that Thou cause them to enter into the Revelation of Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, for whosoever entereth into His Revelation may well enter into the subsequent Revelation, and whosoever entereth into that subsequent Revelation may well enter into the Revelation after that. Therefore, O God, remember me through all the Thrones of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Places of Thy concealment. Verily Thou hast ever been Living and diest not, Sovereign and passeth not away, Just and oppresseth not, King and changest not, and Single - nothing escapeth Thy grasp whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou hast power over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Immortal, the Most Immortal. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Unapproachable! Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things, Who hath manifested His dominion over all existence, Who hath established His sovereignty over all beings, Who hath shown forth His mighty power over all atoms, and Who hath revealed His compelling force over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He and all His creation bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been alive and powerful, ever shall He be the One Who giveth life and death without measure or transition. He shall cause all things to die while He liveth through His own life, and He shall take all unto Himself while He remaineth the Life-Giver over His servants. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. He and all His creation bear witness that there is none other God but Him, and that the Seven Letters are His servant and His Word. Say: Through Him God createth what He willeth in that Paradise, and through Him God provideth what He willeth in that Paradise, and through Him God ordaineth in that Paradise, and through Him God giveth life to what He willeth in that Paradise, and through Him God raiseth up what He willeth in that Paradise. His is the power and the might from before and after, then in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Supremely Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.In the name of God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Unapproachable! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Unapproachable, the Most Unapproachable. The glory from God be upon the First One and upon those who resemble that One wherein naught is seen save the One. I testify that death hath outward manifestations, which is to die to all that God loveth not, and this is thy highest station and most exalted degree. God causeth thee to die as He willeth through what He willeth. What thou hast heard concerning the death of all things is the death of the spirit of truth in thy heart, not the physical death of thy body. Recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest if thou desirest to be alive; otherwise thou must surely die, for when God maketh Himself known to thee through the spirit which He attacheth, and when thou hearest from Him that there is none other God but I, yet art not drawn to Him, then art thou dead. If the spirit of divinity were within thee, it would be drawn to its throne. Consider then the stations of the Names, for the spirit of each Name in its degree may die to the spirit of the Name of Divinity yet not die to the spirit of the Name of Lordship. Similarly, thou mayest believe in Muhammad but not in Ali, or the reverse. For when thy heart believeth in the first to believe, it is attached to the spirit of Lordship, yet thou art dead to the spirit of Divinity since thou hast not believed in him who first believed in Him. Thus do the stations descend in their degrees, for the spirit of clay in its limit \[...\]

Thus do the stations descend in their degrees, for the spirit of clay is bound by its limits, and when God desires to withdraw it from thee, He takes away the clay. And similarly, thou shalt ascend to a station where death hath no dominion. There shalt thou find repose in God, exalted be His glory, and abide in the perpetuity of God, glorified be His majesty. There lies the eternal paradise and the everlasting spirit. Yet look not upon this matter through thine own understanding, for it shall not profit thee. Rather, in every Revelation, hold fast unto the Manifestation of that Revelation. At such time, canst thou find any profit in the house of a previous Manifestation? Even so, comprehend the house of the subsequent Manifestation, for whenever the Sun of Truth doth shine, it illumineth those who are guided by it among the followers of His religion. Thus when the Bayan shone forth, the inner essence of those who dwelt in the faith of the Vahid, not the Ahad, were guided by it and illumined by its light. The grace reached not those who remained in the Ahad, much less those who remained at the Primal Point. Complete salvation in this lieth, wouldst thou but perceive it, in entering thyself into every Revelation. For if thou enterest not into the Revelation of the Bayan, thou shalt not be illumined by the lights of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Similarly after this, be not veiled from that Cause, for all those who... And if thou desirest to know about physical death, there is no destroyer save God, through means He hath ordained. If thou wishest the death of anyone in truth, then recite that Name, for God shall surely take his soul and cause him to die, for He hath power over all things. It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Loving, the Most Loving. Say: God is more loving than any possessor of love. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the power of His loving sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Loving, the Most Loving, the Most Beloved. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the dominion and the kingdom, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and the divine realm, then the strength and the celestial domain, then the sovereignty and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Exalted is He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: Who besides God is able to raise up a single one of the Bayan, if ye be knowing? Do ye not behold how God raised up one from the Furqan? Thus doth God show you His signs - can ye not see? Had God not raised them up, would ye have found any way to be guided unto this path? Even as God permitted not Muhammad to raise up a single one from the Gospel - who is able to raise them up save God? Say: God raised them up in the Furqan mysteriously, and none comprehendeth the knowledge thereof save God. Can ye not perceive? And before that, in all the heavenly Books. Say: Who raised them up? Say: God raiseth up all who are in the Bayan in that single One. Do ye not see? God shall soon raise up from Him Whom God shall make manifest whomsoever He willeth. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. Say: None besides Him Whom God shall make manifest can raise up a single soul from the grave of self, if ye be observers of God's Cause. By what means were the Letters of the Bayan honored in God's Book? Say: By God's command, from the Point of the Bayan. Say: Thus do ye witness by God's command from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Verily, He Whom God shall make manifest shall raise up one of the Bayan from whomsoever He wisheth among His chosen ones. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Bountiful, the Generous. This is from God's grace upon them. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Kind. O people of the Bayan! Ye shall surely ask from Him Whom God shall make manifest and aid in this matter according to your ability. God shall raise up from the Manifestation of His Self one of Truth from among those who are His chosen ones and who stand firm in His Cause. Say: We have exalted unto Ourselves the greatest proof whereby ye derive the ways of the Furqan, yet ye perceive not, neither do ye return unto Us but little. Soon will He Whom God shall make manifest take from you the entire Bayan and all that is therein, and ordain for you what He willeth, and begin the creation of all things as He pleaseth by His command, while ye hear this yet return not unto Him, neither do ye remember. Grieve Me not, O people of the Bayan, for your entire religion on that Day is to return unto Him, whether He be in the most exalted heights - and what saddeneth My heart to mention it. Return ye all unto God, for this is your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may revive your religion by entering yourselves into the good-pleasure of your Lord, then to be sustained in another creation. For ye enter not into God's Cause like those who were given the Book before you. Do these hear what ye hear? Likewise, after God's manifestation, ye hear not what those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest hear, and who are assured in God's religion from His presence. And verily I beseech Him Whom God shall make manifest that He may beseech Him Who cometh after Him that the people of the Bayan, and after them unto a number which none save God can reckon, may preserve the Bayan in every manifestation which God shall begin \[...\]

I verily beseech Him Whom God shall make manifest that He shall beseech Him Who will come after Him that verily those who are in the Bayan, and after Him unto a number that none can reckon save God, shall cause the Bayan to endure in every Manifestation that God shall begin, that all may thereby be among those who remember the Primal One. Say: God is more knowing than every possessor of knowledge. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His knowledge's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth. Verily He hath ever been the All-Knowing, the Knower, the Omniscient. Say: God is more powerful than every possessor of power. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His power's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Verily He hath ever been the All-Powerful, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Say: God is more sovereign than every possessor of sovereignty. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His sovereignty's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Verily He hath ever been the All-Sovereign, the Sovereign, the Supreme Sovereign. O ye Manifestations! Make mention of anyone from the Bayan who remaineth upon the earth, that through your grace he may be saved from its fire and be caused to enter the paradise of your Lord - a grace from your presence, a bounty inscribed in the Book. Verily ye are, by God's leave, among the bountiful ones. Be ye ashamed, O people of the Bayan, lest any among you remain in the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest to distress Him Who will appear after Him, even as I am distressed \[...\]

Know that if I recognize the place of His manifestation before Me, verily I shall acquaint them with My Self, even though they and their dominion and their sovereignty are mighty in their sight. Therefore, fear ye God, then enter into the True Faith. Say: Verily those who are in the Bayan are supreme over all who are on earth. Say: All who dwell on earth bow down before those who are in the Bayan, and all who are in the Bayan bow down before Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is their glory, did they but know it. God shall soon cause all who are on earth to enter into the true Faith from His presence, and He shall cause them to appear apart from the Bayan through His grace. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Most Excellent. Say: If ye desire to behold the stations of fire among the nations, observe ye how each Manifestation after is more severe than what existed in the Manifestation before. Then seek ye refuge with Him Whom God hath created. And if ye desire to behold the degrees of paradise in the creation of the Bayan, observe ye how some are raised above others, and for all are degrees from their Lord, and ye are made to swim in the waters of life through the love of God, and all endure through the love of God by a single command. If ye love Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye shall be abashed when He maketh Himself known to you, then ye shall be brought into His presence. Should any matter weigh heavily upon you, ask it of Him and He will lift your burden, then cause you to taste the sweet waters in your hearts that ye may be elevated through the love of God. Say: Your love for God is naught in the sight of God except that ye love Him Whom God shall make manifest, then whomsoever commandeth you by His leave. Thus is your love inscribed in the Book of God. Ye are the Most Glorious Tree from God that ye may love. The Second in the Second.In the Name of God, the Most Loving, the Most Loving. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and beauty, Thine the countenance and perfection, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the force and effectiveness, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the stations and glory, Thine the grandeur and independence, Thine the greatness and sublimity, Thine the honor and inaccessibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the dominion and authority, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy command and creation. Therefore send Thy blessings upon him who observeth the One in the Bayan in all things general and particular, lest he should plunge himself into the sea of the Throne and enter into the fire and be veiled by duality. For Thou, O my God, art the Possessor of all things. Thou hast ordained all the paths of the Bayan one by one, and commanded everyone who hath not entered therein to observe the path of the One in all things, and Thou hast made all the mirrors of the One to be mirrors of the First, that thereby all who are in the Bayan may return unto the First One.

And I have made all the mirrors of the One to be mirrors of the First, that thereby all who are in the Bayan may return unto the First One and behold none save the meaning of the One. Even so have I brought the Bayan into being that all therein may testify that there is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Eternal, the Alone, the Living, the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Sufficient, Who hath not begotten and was not begotten, and there is none like unto Him. Fill then, O my God, with the love of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, for this is love of Thee, and then with love for whatsoever shall appear from Him, for this is love of Thy Cause. Even as Thou hast blessed me with love for the Point of the Bayan, and there is no doubt in me that this is Thy love, since created beings have no way to Thy love except through this. Praise be unto Thee for having blessed me with love for all that hath appeared from Him of the ways of all things, for this is love of Thy Cause through Thy love. Through Thy love and the love of Thy Cause have I become independent of all things, and through Thy bounty and the bounty of Thy Cause have I been exalted above all things. Cause then, O my God, all who are in the Bayan to enter into the ocean of love for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and His commandments, for this is a Paradise the like of which Thou hast not created, and into the love of Him Whom Thou shalt exalt and His words, for this is a Paradise the like of which Thou hast not created. Praise be unto Thee for Thy bounty unto me and unto all things, and unto Thee be the most exalted paradise and the most glorious chambers. Glory be unto Thee, there is no God but Thee. Glory be unto Thee, verily I am of them that love.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Loving, the Most Loving. Praise be to God Who hath caused all His creation to taste the love of His Self and the love of His Essence, and hath made their submission like unto each other, and hath made the number of each one the number of the name of the Gates, that all who enter through the Gate may taste, in their prostration before God, the Lord of Lords, of the love of God and His bounty. And He hath made the ranks of the ten from the ranks of the Point unto the nineteen complete, and hath placed upon him who hath been distinguished in the knowledge of letters the numbers of the Point, each one the number of the letter Ha, and hath manifested from it His name, the Single, after taking the Vav, then degree by degree in the ranks of the ten until the rank of the Point reacheth the rank of the Ta. Then appear the forms of the nine in their limit upon the manifestation of the name of God, the Strong. Blessed is he who shall recognize at every manifestation those exalted tens and those impregnable Gates, even though at the beginning of every manifestation all names belong to Him Who is manifest therein, in Whom naught is seen save God. But God, through the wonderful crafting of His wisdom and the length of the days of the years of the ten in one of the stations from the ranks of the Point to the tens, hath ordained at every manifestation that all souls may enter into that bounty, for this is the essence of love and the pure bounty for him whom God hath caused to stand, in every manifestation, in faith in Him Who is manifest therein, and in His love and His bounty, for that is from the love of the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, and from the bounty of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Loving, the Most Loving. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One \[...\]

And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen except the First Unity. Then bear thou witness that the entire Bayan is the manifestation of the Lordship of the Sun of Truth and Its utterances to all things are from God, exalted be His majesty - that which was revealed unto Him and that which is possible from Him - for that is evident within its limits. Therefore testify that there exists nothing except that God, glorified be He, hath created within it love for His Self and affection for His Essence, and there exists nothing except that it claims to love God and cherish Him. However, God beareth not witness to anyone's love and affection save those who love Him Whom God shall make manifest and His commandments, and whose devotion to Him is like unto the mountains of the earth, nay weightier than this. And if thou hast comprehended this, then verily thou hast loved God; otherwise thou hast reckoned thyself to love God while God hath not attested to thy love. And verily the degrees of love have informed thee from the Point unto the letter Ta, wherein in those degrees is created the number of Ha for the Gate. Bear thou witness that the mystery of all things is the First Gate - through it hath God created what He hath created and through it shall God cause to return what returneth unto Him, glorified and exalted be He above what they describe. And it hath four degrees: The first of the first: In the name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Compassionate. There is no God but He, the Most Compassionate, the Most Compassionate. Say: God is more compassionate than any possessor of compassion. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His compassionate sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is compassionate, merciful, and kind. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth in devotion whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who perisheth not, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God is more compassionate towards you than your own selves, if ye would but remember. Say: From the beginning of your lives unto their end, ye care not that ye should enter into the fire \[...\]

And between them there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is more compassionate towards you than your own selves, if ye would but remember. Say: From the beginning of your lives until their end, ye care not that ye enter into the fire, and after your death ye find no rest. But God, in His compassion towards you during your lives, would deliver you from your fire and cause you to enter a paradise whose breadth is as the breadth of heaven and earth, wherein ye shall receive whatsoever ye ask for through God's bounty. Therefore believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, for this is the essence whereby all your deeds and your very beings shall be rectified, if ye but knew. Fear God, lest ye be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, for this concerneth your own selves and your deeds - will ye not be God-fearing? Consider those who were veiled from Muhammad, the Apostle of God: how throughout their lengthy existence they performed their works thinking they did well, while ye truly know that they were working for other than God. Likewise those who have entered the Bayan shall testify that ye work for other than God. Therefore have mercy upon yourselves, O people of the Furqan, and by God's compassion revealed in the Book, enter ye into the Most Great Paradise. Similarly on the Day of Resurrection, if ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, those who do believe in Him shall testify that ye work for other than God. Work then for none but God by working for Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may rectify your deeds and your beings, and exalt you above the earth. Say: The truly discerning are they who at the beginning of every Manifestation witness its return. On the day when God brought forth Jesus, son of Mary, and what was revealed to him, they perceived with the eye of their hearts that in the day of return they would return unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God. These are the fruits of God's religion from His presence - do ye not see? And on the day when God originated the religion of Islam through what He revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, His knowledge encompasseth that in your return unto the Proof of your Lord ye return not. Those who did return unto Him - these are the fruits of Islam. Thus hath God preserved them therein that ye might fear God and be guided by Him. And verily We now witness your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, though ye know it not. Those who return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest - these are the fruits of that religion and the essences of that creation, and these are the inheritors, whether they be the highest or lowest among creation. Indeed, they shall be judged by their religion. Judge not on the Day of Resurrection by your testimonies, your wealth, or your knowledge, except that ye look to the Proof of your religion, then by it shall ye question concerning all, high and low. Say: The lowly who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest - these are the highest of creation in God's sight, and to this We are witnesses. And verily the highest, should they be veiled from Him Who created them, sustained them, causeth them to die and brings them to life, nothing of what they have acquired shall profit them - and We are cognizant of all things. Say: The likeness of that creation and those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest is as the essence of gardens. God taketh the essence of that creation through Him Whom God shall make manifest, then He causeth the leaves of the gardens to fall to earth, which benefit none save the animals - will ye not fear God? Will ye not consider how We took the essences of those in Islam from you \[...\]

They who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest are like unto the essence of gardens. God taketh that essence of creation through Him Whom God shall make manifest, then casteth the leaves of the gardens upon the earth where none but beasts derive benefit therefrom. Do ye not fear God? Do ye not see how We took the essences of those in Islam from you and made you as dead leaves from which none but beasts derive benefit? Be ye then ashamed before God that ye make yourselves the sustenance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and not the sustenance of beasts and fire while ye perceive not. Verily, they who believed from among the followers of Jesus in Muhammad - these hath God made the sustenance of His Messenger, while all others became but sustenance for the beasts of the earth. Do ye not observe? Those who believed from Islam in Ali before Muhammad - these hath God made the sustenance of the Seven Letters, while all others became but sustenance for beasts. It behooveth not God to make them the sustenance of His paradise. Purify then your souls by fearing God on the day of His Manifestation, not through what ye observe in your religion, for on the Day of God's Manifestation ye shall be tested while ye perceive it not. Verily those in Islam who have ascended in piety to the highest horizon have thereby passed judgment upon God their Lord whence they know not and perceive not. Were they to realize what judgment they have passed, they would surely slay themselves before anyone could slay them by God's leave, as recompense for what their hands have wrought, though they worship night and day and follow the command of His Proof. How then when they discover that they have judged God Whom they worshipped and pronounced against His Proof Whose command they followed? Is there in God's knowledge any fire like unto this, if ye would but remember? Thus shall We seize you and burn you and turn your highest to your lowest, exposing you until the Day of Resurrection for your deeds, as recompense for the day when ye heard My mention yet did not prostrate. This is your exposure before God your Lord - how much more before His creation! O people of the Bayan, guard yourselves against this! Should ye hear of One Who hath appeared, while knowing neither His beginning nor His end, ye shall neither affirm nor deny, lest ye enter the fire while ye know not. For that One might well be Him Whom God shall make manifest, Whom ye await night and day. Shield yourselves through your faith in Him, for none can better shield you from yourselves than yourselves, nor better guard you against yourselves than yourselves. Purify then your faith while reposing in the cradle of glory and guidance. And if in your hearts be aught less than this, God's Cause will shield you. Make not yourselves lower than those who embraced Islam through Muhammad the Messenger of God while their hearts were less than this. Make your hearts like your outward selves and your outward selves like your inward selves. Conceal not in yourselves what God loveth not, and fear God, for on the Day of His Cause your inner selves shall be exposed while ye shall not escape. Yet in the days of God's Manifestation ye conceal yourselves, and in the Mother Book until the Day of Resurrection ye are not mentioned in truth. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Compassionate. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness \[...\]

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the grandeur, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the glory and the majesty, Thine the beauty and the comeliness, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the stations and the sublimity, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the grandeur and transcendence, Thine the glory and the invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.How compassionate art Thou to Thy creation and how merciful to Thy servants, for Thou knowest the utter nothingness and the pure existence of Thine own Self, and Thou hast placed the signs of the essence of creation in the souls of the horizons and of creation, that there might be in them the spirit of life from those essences and the mystery of good-pleasure from those dawning-places. Glorified, glorified art Thou! How merciful, how compassionate, how kind, how generous, how bountiful, how loving, how gracious, how excellent art Thou in all whereupon the name of a thing can fall, by itself and through itself!Glorified and exalted art Thou! O God, do Thou raise up from Thy presence Manifestations of mighty exaltation and Daysprings of holy invincibility, and cause all who are on earth to enter, through Thy direction, into Thy religion, and show unto them Thy compassion, Thy generosity, Thy mercy, Thy grace, Thy favor, Thy kindness, Thy gifts, Thy blessings, Thy bounties and Thy wonders, for whatsoever Thou willest hath been before all things and will be after all things, and whatsoever Thou willest not hath not been before and will not be thereafter.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest and upon the essences of those whom Thou choosest from the creation of the Bayan, for upon them revolve all who are in the Bayan from the first that Thou didst reveal until the time Thou shalt expose it. O God, do Thou ordain whatsoever He Whom God shall make manifest loveth in respect to their nearness, their knowledge, their perfection and their station, and whatsoever Thou hast given to Thy chosen ones of Thy lofty attributes and bestowed upon Thy martyrs of Thy well-pleasing names.Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy, Everlasting, Ever-Abiding, Invincible, Transcendent, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. All things have ever been within Thy grasp and in the right hand of Thy will. Thy compassion is more exalted than that any save Thee should reckon it, and Thy mercy more resplendent than that any besides Thee should comprehend its knowledge. I have witnessed from the Dawning-Places of Thy love naught save Thy compassion \[...\]

Your mercy is too glorious for any but You to comprehend. I have witnessed from the dawning-places of Your love naught but Your compassion and affection, and were I to witness aught else, it would not be befitting of You. Glorified and exalted art Thou! You give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily You are the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. You create whatsoever You will by Your command. Verily, You have power over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most CompassionatePraise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent things, Who hath prevailed in His dominion over all created things, Who hath manifested in His Revelation above all existing things, Who hath demonstrated His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath shown His compassion toward all that hath been and shall be created among all atoms. I testify, and all creation with me, that there is none other God but Him - a testimony purified from the doubts of allusions and cleansed from the turbidity of limitations. A testimony that filleth the pillars of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them with the subtleties of His unified manifestation, whereby everything speaketh of the glory of His eternal sovereignty and oneness, and whereby everything attaineth the summit of His generosity, the heights of His grace and His loving-kindness. A testimony that is discerning, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, luminous, merciful, complete, perfect, great, mighty, knowing, powerful, pleasing, loving, noble, sovereign, ruling, transcendent - which surpasseth all testimonies in its primordiality and ultimateness and its inwardness, and ascendeth above all evidences in its pureness, its simplicity, its essence and its abstraction, until everything upon which the name of a thing hath fallen in the paradise of utterance is made to speak that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Sovereign.He hath chosen for the throne of His manifestation and the seat of His concealment an essence that is His and an abstraction that is resplendent and a purity that is exalted and a simplicity that is impregnable and a reality that is magnificent. Then He revealed Himself to it through itself and cast into its identity the likeness of its own essence. Thus were His signs made manifest through it and His words illumined all that is in the kingdom of His earth and heaven. I testify, and all creation with me, that there is none other God but Him and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant, His Glory, His Majesty, His Beauty, His Grandeur, His Light, His Mercy, His Words, His Names, His Might, His Knowledge, His Power, His Will, His Command, His Honor, His Bounty, His Dominion, His Loftiness, and whatsoever pertaineth unto His most holy names and sacred attributes, for that is the source of names and the first to be named in the world of creation. May God's blessings be upon Him and upon His primary guides and those who enumerate His final examples, so long as the sun shineth and the stars move and whatsoever is in the night and day cometh unto Him, until it reacheth the glory of eternity.

In the name of God, the Most Considerate, the Most Considerate! Praise be to God, beside Whom there is no other God, the Most Considerate, the Most Considerate. And verily all glory be from God unto the Primal Unity and unto him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity. And furthermore, I bear witness that through the considerateness of God, exalted be His glory, is manifested the considerateness of the Point of the Bayan. Observe His considerateness, how He waited five years for those who followed the Qur'an to return unto God, the Lord of lords. His Cause reached all those within Islam through messengers and scriptures and whatever means were at His disposal. Yet when they returned not unto God, He was ashamed to make mention of it. Had the Primal One desired to bring forth the creation of the Bayan at once, who could have said 'why' or 'wherefore'? But this was due to His considerateness toward the people of Muhammad, that they might return unto God during the years of the letter Ha. Then He called them to witness what their hands had wrought after such considerateness. Yet the Tree of Truth confronteth creation only with grace, for were He to confront them with justice, none would merit either return or beginning. Therefore watch over thyself in the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that thou mayest be among those who return to the Bayan, lest thou waste thy Cause on that Day. Should thy faith be made manifest in thy Book, this would be better for thee than worshipping God from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end. For through the best manifestations, perchance He Whom God shall make manifest will accept thee among the dwellers of the return of the Bayan. Yet in thy worship God will not testify in thy favor with truth, and thou shalt enter the fire with those who enter therein. For the right of servants is to believe in God and His Proof and whatsoever hath appeared from Him of the wonders of His command and His prohibition, not thy persistence in what thou wert following. For this is of the nature of negation - seek refuge with God from it. For he hath denied what he was following and entered the fire, even as thou seest those who follow the Gospel and all other peoples. But recognize the Manifestation of God at each revelation and enter therein through God, prostrating thyself before God and the Master of that Manifestation. For this is among the attributes of the monotheists and the way of the perfected ones. And after attaining such honor say: 'Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.' \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Gracious! There is no God but He, the Most Gracious, the Most Gracious! Say: God is more gracious than any possessor of grace. None can withhold themselves from the dominion of His gracious sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been gracious, bestower of grace, and all-gracious.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, Whom glorify all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Unto God belongeth the divinity of all that He hath created and will create, and God is the Divine One, the Divinity unto Whom all turn. Unto God belongeth the lordship of all that He hath created and will create, and God is the Lord of lords, the All-Nurturing.Say: God hath intended by this the signs of your hearts wherein naught is seen save God. Will ye not then love? Ye ascribe yourselves unto God and then ascend in His path.Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All shall return unto Him.We have indeed heard what thou hast inscribed in the Book, and We shall surely deliver thee and those who believe in God, the Most High, the Most Great.Say: This Book is from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto all that He hath created and will create, that ye worship none but God and be possessors in the earth by His leave.Say: Praise be to God, to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. He hath taken unto Himself neither consort nor son, and He hath no partner in sovereignty, nor any protector on earth save those who, by His leave, magnify Him, by His leave glorify Him, by His leave exalt Him, by His leave beautify Him, by His leave render Him glorious, by His leave illuminate Him.There is no God but God, the Lord of the visible and invisible, the Lord of all worlds.Indeed, thou hast asked thy Lord concerning one whom thy love for God hath overwhelmed - the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the visible and invisible, the Lord of all worlds.

By Him Whom God shall make manifest and by the Lord of all worlds, He hath indeed come unto thee, and were the veils to be lifted from all things at every moment, they would hear My mention, be drawn unto it, and would cry out in ecstasy, for that is the ultimate beginning and end for which they strive night and day. And when God causeth them to attain unto Him, behold, they seek for even more. Say: There was naught after God, and naught before God, and all stand firm by God's command. And verily We have increased thy passion for God and shall enhance thy love, though whatsoever thou mayest traverse shall not attain unto thine own sign, how much less unto the sign of thy Lord! Say: Glorified be God above all they describe. We have indeed favored thee again after the first time, which is better for thee than all thou hast wrought from the beginning that hath no beginning until now. Be thou therefore thankful, for We are indeed bountiful. And when thou reachest that point, say: From God, the Most High, the Most Great. The splendor from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The majesty from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The beauty from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The grandeur from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The light from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The mercy from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The names from God are upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The glory from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The will from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The knowledge from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The power from God is upon the exponents of His Cause in every time, before time and after time. The good-pleasure from God is upon the exponents of His might in every time, before time and after time. The honor from God is upon the exponents of His might in every time, before time and after time. The sovereignty from God is upon the exponents of His might in every time, before time and after time. The dominion from God is upon the exponents of His might in every time, before time and after time. The loftiness from God is upon the exponents of His might in every time, before time and after time.

And after a time, verily the favor is from God upon the guides of His might at all times, before and after a time. And verily the verses are from God upon the guides of His might at all times, before and after a time. And verily the words are from God upon the guides of His might at all times, before and after a time. I am, verily, God; there is no God but Me. O thou who riseth unto Me, I shall cause thee to enter the ocean of My names. O ye who are endued with loftiness, that ye may be thankful! I have made you to be the numbers that God hath witnessed, before and after, that there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And if My servants do not exalt you, yet shall I know you and recompense you in the mansions of your paradise according to what ye ask of your Lord's bounty. Do ye not observe those who are in the Bayan, how they ascend unto you and, by God's leave, offer you their salutations? This is your recompense in the first life, and in the hereafter ye shall hearken unto the True One Who God shall make manifest. O Ali! If people knew the measure of thy journey in the path of God, they would take the very dust whereon thou treadest unto God. But the people are, on that day, asleep. When God breatheth into them the spirit of life, then shall they know and perceive. Say: To him who hath believed in that land, know thou the measure of what is attributed to God and aid the Cause of God, for We are, of all things, knowing. Let nothing deter thee from the path of God, for We are witness to all things. And if anyone seeketh help, then from God's exaltation of this unto thee is better than all that thy Lord God hath been worshipped throughout thy life from a beginning that hath no beginning. And deal kindly with those who are related to the name of the Other, for We are ever mindful. And whatsoever kindness ye show unto them, We shall surely increase it. Soon shall that land be like the land that is there, all ascending - nay, greater than that and more exalted than this. We are, verily, powerful over all things. But draw not nigh unto what grieveth thee, and preserve thyself and then thy believing brethren. And verily what thou hast mentioned, O Ali, in the Book concerning the mention of thy Lord's name, the Most High, the Most Great - yea, He is well-pleased, and We are well-pleased therewith. Deal thou kindly according to thy capacity and leave him not except by his leave, for this is God's way concerning those who have believed in God and His signs, and those who are sincere in God's religion. And verily the Truth is not devoid of two matters - they are believers in paradise. Say: Be ye steadfast and aid ye God's Cause, and ye shall possess all that is on earth by God's leave, if ye desire the first life. What is with God is better and more lasting, if ye would but reflect on your stations in God's verses. And say to those besides them who are in the fire: Sufficient unto you is what ye have, and ye shall die like those who were before you, then shall ye enter the fire of the hereafter.

Ye shall die like those who were before you and then shall enter into the eternal fire. Woe unto you! We have created you and sustained you and caused you to die and brought you back to life, that ye should worship none but God. How then do ye worship other than God and perceive it not? God shall soon seize you and those who reject His command. Verily He is the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful, the Severe. Say: Do they hear mention of those who came before them save that they entered the fire and are remembered without right? Therefore have mercy upon yourselves and worship none but God, for ye were not created except in truth. How then do ye not fear?The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Kind, the Most KindGlorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the strength and the action, Thine the mercy and the bounty, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the likeness and the examples, Thine the stations and the grandeur, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the pride and the magnificence, Thine the might and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and the gladness, Thine the sovereignty and the dominion, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou created all things and ordained them according to Thy decree. By Thy will hast Thou formed all things and fashioned them according to Thy design. O God, Thou shalt raise up one who shall judge after Thee among Thy creation, and shall exact retribution for Thy loved ones from Thine enemies, and shall inspire all Thy creation with this, lest any be veiled from Thy good-pleasure. Thou desirest naught but that all should enter Thy paradise and be delivered from Thy fire. How kind art Thou to Thy creation and how compassionate to Thy servants! Thou dost ever give life and cause to die, then cause to die and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things. O God, do Thou aid him who ascendeth unto Thy loved ones by Thy leave, and who raiseth up Thy Cause by Thy might, and who desireth to exalt Thy Word by Thy wisdom. Verily Thou art powerful over all things, and Thou art cognizant of all things, and Thou art mighty, invincible, and powerful.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Kind, the Most KindPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all created things \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most GraciousPraise be to God, Who hath exalted Himself in His sublimity above all created things, and through His dominion hath triumphed over all existing things, and through His sovereignty hath manifested Himself above all beings, and through His transcendence hath risen above all atoms, and through His power hath shown His might above all creatures, and through His inaccessibility hath remained unattainable above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and through His strength hath demonstrated His power above all things, and verily Thou art the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Powerful \[...\]

They who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes bear witness - as do all created things - that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen for Him primary names, then immersed them in the limitless ocean beyond count or bound. Thus hath He filled His heavens and earth with the testimony that there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling. Through this Point of the Bayan hath God created all letters infinitely unto infinity, and all abide by His command from Him.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Compatible, the Most Compatible! There is no God but Him, the Most Compatible, the Most Compatible! And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. Furthermore, I testify that whatsoever is designated by any name is the compatibility of God, glorified be His majesty, and its manifestation is from the compatibility of the Tree of Truth. God hath given thee a drop thereof, whereby thou shalt rise above those within thy religion and prevail over those outside it. When there is divine favor therein, thou mayest seek thereby wondrous glad tidings if thou wishest; otherwise be patient with the All-Mighty when thou witnessest... for thee from a beneficial command. Otherwise return unto God, for all return unto God. Guard thy path from those who comprehend not the knowledge of thy humility, lest thou witness sorrow. Display all thy victory and power regarding those who have ascended unto God if thou art able to find a way thereto. Otherwise God will accomplish His purpose, perfect His light, and complete His decree. Verily there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.And it hath four stations. The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Protecting, the Most Protecting! There is no God but Him, the Most Protecting, the Most Protecting! Say: God is the Most Protecting above every protector. None in the heavens or earth or what lieth between them can withstand the sovereignty of His protection. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been an all-protecting protector. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the dominion and the kingdom, then the might and the power supreme, then the strength and the divine realm, then the force and the ruby realm, then the sovereignty and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.

Blessed is He Who createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that is between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall protect you from what is before you and what is behind you, and from your right hand and your left, and from above your heads and beneath your feet, and from every quarter whereunto ye might turn, through His angels of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them. Verily, He is the Guardian over all things.Say: Who but God can watch over you by night and by day, and ordain the measure of all things in the Book? Will ye not then be thankful? Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Splendid, the All-Splendid, the Splendid One. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the All-Majestic, the Majestic One. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Beautiful, the All-Beautiful, the Beautiful One. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Grand, the All-Grand, the Grand One. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Luminous, the All-Luminous, the Luminous One. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Merciful, the All-Merciful, the Merciful One. Unto God belongeth the perfection of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Perfect, the All-Perfect, the Perfect One. Unto God belong the words of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Protecting, the All-Protecting, the Protector. Unto God belong the names of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Great, the All-Great, the Great One. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Mighty, the All-Mighty, the Mighty One. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Knowing, the All-Knowing, the Knowing One. Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Powerful, the Powerful One. Unto God belongeth the good-pleasure of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Pleased, the Well-Pleased, the Pleasing One. Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Loving, the All-Loving, the Beloved One. Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Sovereign, the All-Sovereign, the Sovereign One. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Ruling, the All-Ruling, the Ruler. Unto God belongeth the transcendence of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the All-Exalted, the Exalted One.These are the verses of the Unity in your hearts and souls and minds and bodies, which ye shall ever perceive. O Ali! Verily I am God, there is no God but I, and all else is My creation. Say: O My creation! Worship ye Me! I created thee from a beginning that had no beginning, and I provided for thee, and caused thee to die, and gave thee life, until I revealed Myself unto thee. Verily, We have power over all things.

I raised thee up, that I might present thee; verily We were powerful over all things. And verily the fruit of thy being, from a beginning that hath no beginning even unto this time, is that thou hast believed in God and wert of them that are assured of His signs. Therefore hast thou worshipped thy Lord from a beginning that hath no beginning, and wert among the believers in all the worlds. Such as have not worshipped God their Lord from a beginning that hath no beginning - their works shall God bring to naught. Bear thou witness that there is no kinship between God and any soul; all before God are servants who are created by His command. They who know God and are assured of His signs, these are the companions of paradise in the Book of God, and these are they that shall attain. Whether they possess what is on earth or possess nothing - this is the path of God for them that fear Him. And they who know not God and believe not in His signs, these are the companions of the fire, whether they possess aught or possess nothing - this is the path of God unto all peoples. And if thou wouldst know the companions of paradise - they are such as have known God and believed in the Point of the Bayan. These, after the death of their bodies, shall enter lofty chambers of paradise. They shall have whatsoever their souls desire, and God shall bestow more upon whomsoever He willeth of His servants; verily He is possessed of great bounty. He loveth that none be mentioned save them, yet all worship God thy Lord - some knowingly and consciously, and some unknowingly and unconsciously. So cause thou to enter paradise them that love thee, for this is of God's bounty unto them that love Him. Turn away from such as desire not to believe in God nor in His signs, for thy Lord is independent of all worlds. His mercy embraceth all things if they enter into the religion of the Bayan; otherwise they are by their own selves veiled from the good-pleasure of God. The best attribute in the sight of those whom people call Sufis is that they desire not to wrong anyone, though they themselves be far removed from the path of God. Yet this attribute is but as leaves of the Most Exalted Paradise. God loveth not that any should be saddened in His path, but rather that all should enter into His good-pleasure. Thy book was presented before God and We were watching. And verily the measure of what thou hast seen in the path - if thou hadst known thyself through Him Who hath manifested what beseemeth thee not - would reveal unto thee what would gladden thy heart. But the matter hath been decreed, and God knoweth all that men do. Say: All act according to their way. If ye see good, say: This is from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And if ye see other than good, say: This was created by God's command and is not attributed to God in any mighty Book. Grieve not over this, for if God should will, He would return it unto thee in such wise as befitteth the powerful. And as for what thou didst write in the book of Abu'l-Kaf \[...\]

Verily what thou hast written in the Book of Ab-Kaf and Kha harmeth not God, thy Lord, in any way, for We are indeed independent of all things. Rather, We desired that Our mercy should reach him inasmuch as he followed before, and We were gracious. Should the Book of thy Lord reach him, he hath indeed accepted it and placed it upon his eyes as in the Furqan, for there is naught but worshippeth God, thy Lord, and shall be among those who prostrate themselves.We have sent all the Messengers, saying: "Worship none but God, my Lord and your Lord." This is a straight path. We have revealed all the Books, and We are indeed cognizant of what We have revealed therein. We revealed therein no greater command than their belief in God, their Lord, and His signs. Yet most people remain veiled from that for which We sent the Messengers and revealed the Books.On the Day of Resurrection each soul must needs appear according to the measure of its faith, the good that lieth hidden within them, and that which lieth concealed beneath. Grieve not at this, for We know whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. All call upon Us night and day, beseeching that the veil be lifted from their sight that they might receive their Lord's Book, even though they walk throughout their lives. Yet since they comprehend not the knowledge revealed therein, they are not among the mindful ones.If thou reach him, verily God thy Lord is the best of those who reach. And if thou be prevented therefrom, then God's proof is complete against him, and God will show him His signs. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Subtle.By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! My heart desireth not that in God's knowledge anything should remain inanimate beneath that Paradise, how much less that it should not be considered human in the Mother Book. Therefore place thy trust in God, thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. Remember whatsoever strengtheneth thy heart, that there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Beloved. And remember those who love the Primal Point through their prior love, both men and women, for if God so willeth He shall guide all unto the path of certain truth.As for what thou mentioned concerning the cloak, had it reached one bearing the name of thy Lord, the Supreme, the Eternal, it would have been better in the Mother Book. However, the matter resteth in God's hands - He ordaineth what He willeth and confirmeth what He desireth. We have permitted him who possesseth the glory of the cloak to dispose of it until We issue a new command hereafter.Concerning the name about whose meaning thou didst inquire: should it reach one bearing the name of thy Lord, the One, the Single, when he seeth goodness therein it shall reach him who guideth to the mention of thy Lord's name, the Supreme Creator. As for what thou hast mentioned regarding the four Names, say: These are the guides of thy Lord in the Book. We have mentioned them before in thy Book, and We were witness over them. Say: He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great.

He is the Inmost Hidden One. There is no god but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. If thou remainest patient in the land of knowledge, there shall be revealed unto thee that which will calm thy heart. Verily, He is the All-Wise Doer. And if thou journeyest to thy homeland, protect thyself and those related to thee, that none may be saddened in the path of God, for this is God's grace unto all worlds. And remember the First One there, as thou wert among those present before Him Whom thou didst mention. Thus have We commanded thee to inquire from the Throne of Him Who bore the Point of the Bayan and was among the believers in God's verses. And concerning what We had written before regarding the number of Ra and Ba, when it reaches thee from thy Lord, be thou among those who deliver it. Before that, We gave thee no permission, and it shall be sent to thee when God, thy Lord, willeth. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And as for what thou didst send to God, thy Lord, of two delicate white ones, then of three beautiful crystals - We counsel thee not to be as thou wert in thy former days, that thou shouldst guard against what God hath created for those who believe in God and His signs. Say: Who hath forbidden save God unto His servants? O My servants, be ye thankful, for We have permitted you. And those among the learned who have defiled themselves through their piety - these have no portion of knowledge. God hath seized them in their worldly life, and in the Hereafter they shall not be helped. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! If God were to gather for Me the means of authority from His presence, I would not use anything unless it were unmatched upon the earth. Hath God created all He hath created for other than him who believeth in Him? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! This is God's path in that Paradise for those who are capable within themselves. And what I give them not, God shall give them the reward thereof if they love. And I do not forget the cloak of Ahmad which I had as guest one day when I was among those present. Say: If this be from the fear of God in the Furqan, do ye not read that verse? Say: Who hath forbidden the adornment of God which He hath brought forth for His servants, and the good things of sustenance? That was what was revealed aforetime in the Furqan, if ye be discerning in your religion. Though We had revealed mention of the Hereafter in that verse, yet were We knowing of this. Say: The end of every Manifestation is its beginning - will ye not be grateful? This is other than that end with which ye are promised after your death. And if ye have heard the tradition of Muhammad and Ali in the beginning of Islam, this was when it had not yet appeared with them, but when it appeared with Hasan, how do ye remember it? Then deduce! Say: This is the limit of piety in his worldly life, yet with God thy Lord he was not pious, for had he been pious he would have believed in God and His signs and would have been among the saved on the Day of Resurrection. Grieve not for them, for We see all the peoples upon the earth after Me, when thy Lord's proof hath been completed against them, patient in their religion, like those who were given the Book before.

And he was among those who were saved on the Day of Resurrection. Grieve not for them, for when We observe all the peoples on earth after Me, thy Lord's proof hath been completed against them. They remain steadfast in their religion, even as those who were given the Book aforetime. God will cause this Faith to prevail over all religions, for verily He hath ever been the Manifester, the Manifest, the Helper. Say: Verily, the Truth on that Day is confined to those who have entered the Bayan and are assured of God and His signs. As to others, they possess no greater proof than their Book, their Prophet and their Imams. We have indeed set forth the measures thereof from Our presence, yet they possess naught of this save when they return unto God, thy Lord, and believe in what God hath revealed unto His Proof. Be patient, for the ultimate victory belongeth to those who fear God and to those who do good. And if thou seest one who maketh mention of the name of Ahmad in thy land, guide him to the path of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And if thou perceivest in him an essence whereby he may be guided, well and good; otherwise remain silent, for if God had willed, He would have guided all the worlds. And it hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Fostering, the Most Fostering. There is no God but He, the Most Fostering, the Most Fostering. Say: God is more fostering than any fosterer. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the dominion of His fostering sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the All-Fostering, the Supreme Fosterer, the Most Fostering. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. Praise be to God, Whom all things in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them do glorify. Say: All stand in devotion before Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Sovereignty, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Realm of Light, then the Rule and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily your Fosterer in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, if He willeth, will unite you in one cause, and if He willeth, will separate you, and God knoweth best how ye will, on the Day of Resurrection, rise up in the religion of God. Say: Verily We shall bring all who are in the Bayan to one cause wherein none shall differ, and verily We have power over all things.

Verily We have power over all things. If We wish, We shall cause to descend upon the stations of what We have created these who discern the stations of God's Cause and those who discern the stations of God's Cause. Nay, these and those, if they believe in Him Whom God shall manifest on the Day of Resurrection, shall be delivered. O number of Ra and Ba, bear thou witness that there is no God but I, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. I have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and brought thee to life. And were I to will it, I would bring forth from thy heart that which would cause the hearts of the mystics to grow haughty. But thou hast not comprehended from thy Lord's command that which is better than this. Say: All are standing by God's command, for all this is that the servant might attain unto the depths of the Names, wherein all are turning unto God's command. Thus have We brought thee to an exalted seat of glory wherein thou seest naught but the face of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: The believers ascend unto God that they may enter Paradise, then from the witnesses of Truth they ask concerning the measure of their faith, and they ascend that they may receive grace from the gates of guidance. There in the depths of glory do they speak. Blessed are they who traverse the ocean of Names, who receive from God's witnesses, who receive from the seats of Command, and who ascend that they may enter the ocean of Names, beholding none save God. Say: The Names are like unto mirrors wherein naught is seen but God. Even so do ye behold naught in mirrors save the sun. Indeed thy Lord God hath conveyed what is better than the limits of creation, for in this all witness the limit of creation, but in that ocean none is seen but God, and all turn unto Him through thy Lord's Names. This is the greatest measure that God hath ordained for whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, that they may testify that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus have all borne witness to that which God hath witnessed, and they have no remembrance save that wherewith God remembereth them. Therefore, O all things, call ye upon God, your Lord, and worship not idols besides God, for verily ye and these shall enter the fire. This is a day when every soul shall be called by their leader. Woe unto these and the leaders of the fire, for both shall enter the fire. If thou desirest to know their station, look upon those who were in the days of Moses: when He came unto them with a sign, they were stirred by something concerning it. And after two thousand years and more, the extent of their faith is less than these, though they account themselves among those who remember the Truth. Nay, by thy Lord! Those who have heard My mention and believed not in God, the Most High, the Most Great - God hath testified concerning them that they have departed from their religion, even while they believe they are firm in their religion. None other than God can send down His verses. When they see clear verses from one unlettered who hath not learned as they have learned, then according to their religion \[...\]

And too, they believed in God, the Most High, the Most Great. But God hath testified concerning them that they have indeed departed from their religion, though in their religion they are believers. Verily, none other than God can reveal His verses. When they beheld clear verses from One unlettered, who had not learned as they had learned, then according to their religion and what God had revealed in the Qur'an, they had no recourse but to say this was from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. They could not say 'this sufficeth us not.' God hath denied them, and their words in the Qur'an beforetime. Say: Ye read the Most Exalted Sign in the Chapter of the Spider. See how I have said 'He is God' while they imagine they do well. And if God should manifest a sign like unto the rod of Moses, then all would believe. Say: God hath revealed greater than that, yet they remember not, nor do they know. Say: Were not the verses of the Qur'an greater than the nine signs of Moses and all the signs of Jesus, how then did God abrogate their religions and establish the true religion in the Qur'an? What aileth you that ye reason not, nor remember? These are verses whereof a single one would confound all the peoples of the world. And if ye be in doubt concerning this, then bring a single verse like unto it, if ye be truthful. Ye cannot, nor will ye be able. And by what God hath decreed in the Qur'an, ye have departed from your religion and cannot return. And if ye return, upon your faces shall be branded the mark of fire, even as ye witness in the new Islam. Nay, by thy Lord! My heart is not pleased that ye should believe in Me or in My verses, for whoso associateth partners with God and His verses, it behooveth him not to enter Paradise, nor be among those who return. Endure ye in your fire even as those who were given the Book before you endured. Verily ye shall die and enter the fire, and ye shall not be helped. And We have made thee one of the witnesses of the Bayan. Therefore write down the number of all things from the paths of all things, for this is a glory from God unto the Day of Resurrection for them that are guided. But on the Day of Resurrection thou shalt defer to Him Whom God shall make manifest. And consume not that which God hath not permitted thee, like those who consume what they have been given of knowledge and wisdom without the permission of its owner, and they know not, nor do they remember. Say: Verily their likeness is baser than those who manifested faith in the days of Muhammad. Behold then the remoteness of the former and the nearness of these, for the nearness of these is not the remoteness of the former. Thus are exposed all the calumniators who worship God, thy Lord, yet judge concerning Him while they know not. Say: If ye are able to speak and judge with truth, do so; otherwise, all that is on earth like unto you will profit you not. This profited those who were before you, yet they entered the fire, and ye too shall soon enter therein. Therefore have mercy on your own souls, for the abasement of this world is better than the fire of the next, if ye would but remember a little.

And verily ye shall enter in. Have mercy, therefore, upon yourselves, for the abasement of this world is better than the fire of the next, if ye would but remember. Verily the believers, when it is the pleasure of thy Lord to raise up or cast down, find therein no abasement at all, for abasement lieth only in that which is contrary to thy Lord's good-pleasure, if they but knew. And verily I have made mention of twenty-five pieces of gold. We have, in truth, been the One Who sent this Book, and We have bestowed it upon thee. Take of it what thou willest, and forbear from what thou willest, for We are indeed the Munificent. Behold how in Islam they have seized My right and consumed without My leave. Say: All of them have consumed fire, and I shall not forgive them even to the extent of a single date-stone from the time God concealed Me until now. I have not forgiven any who have taken of My right. Say: By what permission do ye take of God's right? Thus doth He show them their deeds as regrets against their own souls. They can neither return nor take back. And one in the land of Sad took of My wealth and built a mosque, and were We to appear over it, the very particles of its clay would be washed away by water from above it. Say: Who gave you permission for this? How do ye take of right and dispose of it unrightfully? Say: My follower Kazim, to the extent that he walked to a freeman's house, had not with him even a mithqal of silver or more, while they have taken and desired to build with clay and have laid waste the house wherein the name of thy Lord is remembered at morn and eventide. I have detailed the state of their greatest one before thee, that thou mayest comprehend the station of them all, and We were not heedless of that creation. We have witnesses in Our inward parts who judge by Our leave and who call upon none but God, and in Our outward parts We Ourselves shall assuredly judge between Our servants and shall judge them with truth, for We are witness over all things. Look not upon these verses except with the eye of grandeur, for We are indeed the All-Seeing. By a verse We have sent down aforetime, in every year seventy thousand circle round the House, and were all upon the earth to circle round, the command of God would sustain it. Nay, it is greater still, but people know not the grandeur God hath ordained in His Cause, until when the means of God's Cause appear, then they remember but little. Observe that on the day the verse of the Fifth was revealed, those who heard it perchance paid no heed, but thou shalt see on that day how many servants shall be enriched thereby, and how many servants shall give in the shadow of God's Cause. This is the glory of God's Cause, but the people know it not. Say: Each day a hundred and six times from God, the Self-Subsisting, the Guardian: "Glory be unto Thee, O God! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, then upon those who are the channels of His Cause in glory and majesty." This is a remembrance from thy Lord unto the Day of Return \[...\] Then shall it be said: "Glory be unto Him before Whom bow down all who are in the heavens \[...\]"

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down in worship before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them do glorify. Say: All stand obedient before Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He causeth to live and to die, then causeth to die and to live. He, verily, is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God is the Creator of all things. Is there any god besides Him Who splitteth the grain and the date-stone? Say: Glorified be God! All stand ready at His bidding. Say: Who cleft the sea for Moses, if ye be of them that know? They will surely answer "God." How then do ye not believe in Him Who hath sent down the verses? O thou Name! Bear thou witness that there is none other God but He, the Cleaver, the Most Great Cleaver. I have created all things by My command and all worship Me. Some will recognize Me on the Day of Resurrection and they are assured of My signs. These are the companions of Paradise and these are they who are guided. And some will not recognize Me on that Day though they worship Me through what I have ordained for them aforetime. Is there anything that knoweth not God, thy Lord, or is not among those that bow down before Him? Say: Glorified be God! All worship God their Lord and all bow down before Him.And We have seen before Us the book which thou hast written, and We were knowing of it, and We were witness over all things, and We were beholding that whereunto thou callest Us. And what thou hast mentioned concerning him who desireth to help the Cause of God on the Day of Resurrection through a command exalted and glorious - say: Prepare thyself for the command of thy Lord, for when God's appointed time cometh, verily, We shall be among those who remind. But before this is assured, make no mention of this, and mention that which will strengthen his heart and the hearts of the believers. Blessed is he and that which he hath purposed in the religion of God. Thus doth God bestow His grace upon whomsoever He willeth of His servants. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Encompassing.Say: That which hath occurred to thy heart is better than what thou hast done from the beginning of thy life until now. This will profit thee on the Day of Resurrection before God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: Verily, the matter is nearer than the twinkling of an eye, if ye would but ponder on your final return.

Say: that which thy heart forbiddeth is better than all that thou hast done from the beginning of thy life until now. This shall profit thee on the Day of Resurrection before God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: verily the Cause is nearer than the twinkling of an eye, if ye would but ponder on your ultimate end and final abode, and then remember the days of God. God shall give him in this first life that which shall content his heart. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: this one is of the hosts of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: this one is of the party of God, the Sovereign, the Well-Beloved. Say: this one is of those who answer the distressed, and they are assured of God's command. Behold how all on earth call upon Me, and God hath made Me what ye knew aforetime in the Qur'an. Who is it that answereth the distressed when he calleth upon Him, and succoureth those who have believed in God and His signs, if not God? If ye but knew! Say: verily God will answer you and aid you and deliver you and exalt you and ordain for you what He willeth - all by His command, and all are prostrate before Him. Say: verily God shall manifest whatsoever He willeth through the hands of His servants. Do ye not behold? Say: verily these verses are greater than the nine signs of Moses and the signs of Jesus, if ye would but remember. For thereby did God aforetime through Muhammad elevate what was revealed unto Moses and Jesus. Were it not greater than these two, how could He elevate them thereby and establish what He willeth through them? Do ye not see? Say: ye shall understand the Cause of God before there appeareth what shall come to pass through the Command. This is the essence of knowledge and wisdom, would ye but remember. At the time when the verse of pilgrimage was revealed, all on earth circled round its shadow. Yet despite the remoteness of creation, in every year seventy thousand souls circumambulate. If ye understood the Cause of God before these numbers appeared circling the House, then are ye assured of God's command. And verily thou didst ask God, thy Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all worlds, that God show thee the meeting with His Beauty. Dost thou not see how at this moment all in their appointed places worship Him? Is there any glory above this? And there appeareth but a single boundary from the boundaries of might, if ye would look to the essence of the Cause. All peoples through their Prophets turn unto God their Lord, and all turn unto Me. What aileth you that ye see not the Essence of Glory? God shall soon show thee the meeting with His Beauty in His Glory. Verily He hath power over all things. But thou seest not an atom with Us. We have taught thee, so ascend to the highest horizon that thou mayest witness all possessors of glory prostrate before God their Lord - some knowingly and some unknowingly. Verily those who \[...\]

They who know - these are the companions of the Ridvan, and these are they who have attained. And they who know not - these are they who worship God, thy Lord, while veiled, and that which their hands have earned shall profit them not, and they shall enter the fire. Say: Were there any god besides God, the heavens and earth and all between them would have been corrupted. All stand firm by His command. They who are in heaven worship Me, and they who are on earth worship Me, and whatsoever lieth between them worshippeth Me, and there is nothing but glorifieth My remembrance and is numbered among the worshippers. Is there any god besides Me who createth this creation, or provideth for them, or causeth them to die, or giveth them life? Say: Glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds! And verily We made thee aforetime My Ridvan for them that know, that they might recite within thee My verses by night and by day, and be numbered among them that remember. And We have made thee known that thou mightest be a sign of My proof unto all who understand, both free and bond. Ask all who are upon the earth. The Furqan is a Book which all who are in Islam acknowledge, and besides them are the dead who answer thee not. Yet all declare: This is a Book which was sent down aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, wherein are clear signs for all mankind. Say: If ye be truthful in your words, who can produce the like of such a Book, reciting without doubt that He is Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all worlds, if ye be among the believers in the religion of the Persians? Verily the Furqan was sent down from God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. If then He Who sent it down was none other than God - if ye be of them who were aforetime convinced of your faith - consider whether anyone \[...\] testifieth not that there is no God but I, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, from the lowliest of creation to the highest. Thus have We cast Our words upon them and made them as nothing upon the earth, save those who have recognized Us, for they shall endure upon the earth. Were We to remove the veil from the eyes of all upon earth, they would behold that there is no God but I, and all would turn unto Me. Read not these verses unto him in whom is not found the eye of truth, and guard them as thine own eyes from them that are veiled. For verily a single letter thereof is more precious than all that is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them, and We are independent of all things. And when thou didst ask of God, thy Lord, concerning the elixir of truth in the Book, We did answer thee aforetime. God, thy Lord, hath created all things, and all are His servants. God hath not made lawful unto anyone who believeth not in Him even so much as a grain of mustard seed of this elixir of truth in the Book, whereas He hath made lawful unto you all that ye possess according to what is ordained in the Book. Will ye not then be thankful? We have taught thee aforetime the mystery of speech, if thou be of them that are endued with insight. God will show thee that whereby thy heart shall find rest. He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. And shouldst thou learn a thousand thousand times, or that which cannot be numbered, say: The bounty of God is complete, and we were powerless to comprehend it.

And verily We were powerless to comprehend it, but draw thou nigh only unto that which profiteth thee, for this is of God's bounty to all the worlds. Know thou what God thy Lord hath previously brought forth through thy hands, for if God so willeth, He would assuredly deliver them from the fire. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Powerful, the Mighty. Thou hast asked God thy Lord to grant thee power over mercury, which ye call 'living silver.' Yea, We have power over all things. This is a sign of truth concerning minerals - touch them not except in truth, then put thy trust in God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Say: None hath been granted knowledge of this living thing save the Point, as ye observe in the beginning of the matter. Thus take the sign of the Point and place it upon the living thing, and thou shalt find it submissive unto God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all worlds. This is a mystery in the Mother Book among those who draw nigh. It behooveth not to reveal more than this, and verily We are the preservers of God's Cause. Should thou take its essence, this is nearer - verily We are All-Knowing. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if thou placest the mercury in a crystal vessel and setteth it upon a gentle fire, then addeth some of this essence unto it, thou shalt find it all become one piece, and when thou removest it, it shall be a mighty ingot. Say: Blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds! We have seen this from one who fashioned it - this is of God's handiwork, the One, the Inaccessible. But I counsel thee not to attach thy heart to this, for the Cause of God transcendeth it. Guard thyself and thy believing brethren, for should this matter slip from thy grasp, thou mightest thereafter grieve and be debarred from the Book of thy Lord. Write that whereby thou mayest earn thy livelihood, for this is better for thee and for the believers. Say: God hath provided for thee from the beginning of thy life until now, and will continue to provide hereafter, and all derive their sustenance from God's bounty. And if this should be revealed through thy hands, it would not enrich thy believing brethren. Therefore hasten to that whereby God may enrich all through His bounty, and all on earth shall become possessors. This is nearer to righteousness in the estimation of those endowed with knowledge and those who believe in the signs of God. What shall profit thee in the sight of God is that thou shouldst encompass the knowledge of what hath been revealed from Him, and be of those who remember. Should God bring forth from pure substance that which thy Lord previously gave thee, and thou didst mention the remembrance of His name in the Book, then send unto God thy Lord something refined. We have previously commanded thee to derive from every name whatsoever can be derived therefrom, then attribute it to God, the Lord of the worlds. We have desired to multiply the sources of all names as a bounty from Our presence - verily We are the Bountiful. We love to see the whole Bayan flow from thy pen. Therefore hasten in the Cause of thy Lord, for verily We are swift. We shall convey unto thee that which shall suffice thee, for unto Us belong the treasuries of the heavens \[...\]

Verily, unto Us belong the treasuries of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and We are indeed cognizant of all things. Yet of all this there was naught before God that was befitting, though all imagine within themselves that what they possess belongeth unto God. It behooveth not that there should be in thy Lord's dominion aught save that which hath no equal in thy sight. This is the decree of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. I beseech God to reveal the means thereof from His presence, for He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing.As to what thou hast mentioned regarding thy taking water from that tree without having been commanded beforehand - this profiteth thee not. Draw not nigh save unto that which benefiteth thee - a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. If thou art able to take water from the leaves which We indeed witnessed upon that land, growing from that which its inhabitants from those regions have not... this would be better for thee and nearer unto the worlds.We know not upon what remembrance these people make mention, but it is a rustling tree with small leaves emerging from the earth without its tree having grown. When touched by yellowness its color changes, yet taking its water leaveth no trace therein. Those who engage in this craft have veiled themselves from it and from its effects, yet still they persist therein.The essence of the matter is that thou shouldst be content with what God hath ordained for thee. And if thou desirest to see something, then create from what thou hast mentioned regarding half the amount, for this is nearer in the Book among the believers. Beyond this I know not what thou intendest, but God thy Lord will inform thee when He seeth it is best for thee. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.What I have written: Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not. This fleeing mercury will never remain stable upon that which God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, hath created. Its life is by thy Lord's command, and it hath no partner in sovereignty nor any protector on earth save by His leave. His is the creation and the command, in the past and in the future. There is no God but He, the Living, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.As for what thou hast mentioned in thy poetry about seeing naught but God in everything - this indeed is from God's command, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. However, in all these multiplicities naught can be seen save thy Lord's command, and it is His creation. Speak not of it as the poet hath spoken, for this is not the path of the unitarians. In all mirrors thou seest naught but the sun, yet the sun doth not multiply - these are but reflections in mirrors, each according to its capacity do they indicate.As to what thou hast mentioned regarding the name of thy Lord, the Supreme Protector, say: Verily, all who have made mention of Him and were among the assured ones shall make mention of Him. Blessed are they who have believed in God and His signs, for these are upon a straight path.

These are they who are on a straight path, while others are as dead, though they think themselves alive, yet they perceive not. As for those who harbor doubts about the religion of God and yet have not attained to certitude - God will forgive them, for they are sincere in their faith in God. Say: Is there any doubt about God? He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. He created you and all that you do. And concerning what thou didst mention about those who have believed in God and His signs and who seek His good-pleasure desiring to come unto thee, yet are prevented from what thou writest during the day - grieve not their hearts, but rather confirm their hearts, spirits, souls and bodies upon the path of thy Lord, that they may give thanks in the days of their Lord. But thou shouldst give to each according to the measure of his understanding, for all have entered according to their stations, and they comprehend not the inmost mysteries within the outward appearances, each according to his rank. All belong to God and all are His servants. And We have given thee permission concerning what thou didst seek leave for in the Book. If God doth not manifest from thy grasp, grieve not, for the end belongeth to the patient ones. Let not the fire of thy love be quenched by what appeareth, nor depart from sincerity, for God will purify whom He willeth and will cause to depart whom He desireth. He is the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. As for what thy brother hath sewn, We were grateful, but his hands were larger than My grasp. If it be not amended another time, it would be better for Us, for We were clothed. There hath appeared before God what had reached thee before from the Book of thy Lord - this is of God's grace unto the believers who attain to the presence of their Lord and are assured in the religion of God. Preserve thyself, then thy believing brethren, then what thou hast of the verses of the Mighty, the Inaccessible. And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive. There is no God but He, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive. Say: God is more expansive than all who possess expansion. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the power of His sovereign expansion. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the All-Expanding, the Opener, the Most Expansive. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are humbly devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens \[...\]

Nothing can escape His grasp, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command, and verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and in what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The creation of all created things, past and future, is in the hand of God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all worlds. He it is Who hath created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and to live again. Is there any god besides God who could do these things unto you? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe. All that are in the heavens and on earth and in between them glorify Him, and all are His worshippers. Say: Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and in what lieth between them. He enricheth whom He willeth through His bounty. Verily He was and is the All-Bountiful, the Most Bountiful, the Ever-Bountiful. And say: Praise be to God Who giveth in His dominion unto whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily He was and is the All-Knowing, the Knowing, the Omniscient.Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Splendid, the Splendor-Making, the All-Splendid. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the Majesty-Making, the All-Majestic. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Beautiful, the Beauty-Making, the All-Beautiful. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Grand, the Grandeur-Making, the All-Grand. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Luminous, the Light-Giving, the All-Luminous. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Merciful, the Mercy-Giving, the All-Merciful. Unto God belong the words of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Wise, the Wisdom-Giving, the All-Wise. Unto God belong the names of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Mighty, the Might-Giving, the Almighty. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Powerful, the Power-Giving, the All-Powerful. Unto God belongeth the utterance of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Pleased, the Pleasure-Giving, the All-Pleased. Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Loving, the Love-Giving, the All-Loving. Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Sovereign, the Sovereignty-Giving, the All-Sovereign. Unto God belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Royal, the Kingdom-Giving, the All-Royal. Unto God belongeth the loftiness of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the Exaltation-Giving, the All-Exalted. Unto God belongeth the bounty of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Bountiful, the Bounty-Giving, the All-Bountiful. Unto God belongeth the riches of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, and God is the Most Rich, the Wealth-Giving, the All-Rich. These verses should be recited each day in the number of the Unity upon a spirit \[...\]

By God, He is indeed the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Recite these verses daily in the number of Unity (Vahid) with joy and fragrance from a wondrous and mighty Book. What thou hast written hath been displayed before God, and verily We were listening. Therefore, praise God for having guided thee to the path of certain truth. Verily God's bounty, both before and after, hath been great upon thee. The highest stations of the first life are the good-pleasure of thy Lord, and God hath caused thee to attain them - be thou of the thankful ones. Soon He will cause thee to attain, in the next life, unto the Most Glorious stations, as a bounty from His presence. Verily, He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.For those who have believed in God and His verses - their men, their women, and their offspring - He hath created after their death, in Paradise, bodies of living crimson ruby by thy Lord's leave. When their spirits depart, they attach to these bodies by thy Lord's permission, and in their stations with God are they sustained. Therein shall they have whatsoever their souls desire, and God increaseth His bounty unto whomsoever He willeth among His servants. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Therein are maidens for them like hidden pearls, and youths like treasured rubies of might. Therein are sweet fragrances which, by God's leave, are presented before them. Therein are varieties of silk whose radiance gleams when they look upon it. Therein are elevated seats whereon they recline. Therein they have whatsoever they love, such as hath no equal nor likeness. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Beloved.This is what God hath prepared for those among you who believe and those who will believe thereafter. O number of separation increased by the third letter, bear thou witness that there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. All things that bear the name of a thing are God's creation and His possession, and all subsist by His command. On that Day, nothing on earth shall be lawful unto them save those who have entered the Bayan and are assured of God's command. We have indeed revealed the verses of all things aforetime, yet all have taken their portion without God's leave, and on that Day they shall neither return nor be seen by their Lord. All imagine they work for God, yet God beareth not witness that they work for aught but other than Him. God hath granted thee success in this - it is better for thee than all else, as it returneth unto God, if thou be of those who seek help. How many gave the right of their Imam to one unto whom his own self was not lawful, and how many took when We had not made lawful unto them even so much as a whit! Those who gave and those who took - both have disobeyed their Lord, except they return unto God and repent. Therefore praise thou God, thy Lord, for having given thee of His kingdom what He willeth and taught thee the way of guidance that thou mightest attain unto what was foreordained in the Book. This is of God's bounty unto thee.

He hath taught thee the way of His good-pleasure, that thou mayest attain unto God according to what was ordained aforetime in the Book. This is of God's bounty unto thee and unto the God-fearing. Ponder thou upon all that is on earth, but that which God hath purified is that which hath been delivered from thy hands. Thus doth God purify whatsoever He willeth. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. But thou shouldst be bountiful unto thyself and unto them that love thee, for the treasuries of thy Lord shall never be exhausted, and unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the latter end and in the former time. Verily, in that Paradise it behooveth the servant to secure for himself, if he be able to find a way thereunto, whatsoever things have no equal therein. This is of God's bounty unto the believers, that they may enjoy the favors of their Lord and be among the thankful in the days of God. But thou shouldst not draw nigh unto that which grieveth thee. Put thy trust in God, the Most High, the Most Great. And thou shouldst ask the meaning of what We have revealed unto thee from him whose name betokeneth the name of the Benevolent, the All-Subtle, for this is of God's bounty unto that company, that he may acquaint them with the Command of their Lord and remind them of the favors of their Lord, and that he may recite unto them the measures of their Creator and give them glad tidings of that Paradise concerning which they ask of God's bounty, and warn them against those whom they worship.

Beyond God, while thinking they do well. But verily both the follower and the followed are in the fire, and God will not recompense them nor accept any of their deeds. Thus does He render void the deeds of those who believe not in God and His signs. This is a day when every people shall be brought before God with their leader. These are the leaders of the fire, and whosoever follows them shall abide in the fire. And these, because they followed the martyrs of truth from God, shall abide forever in God's good pleasure. Their proof against those on earth has been perfected from their Lord, and they speak with truth. Thus does God recompense those who believe in God and His signs, and are sincere in God's religion. We have indeed favored thee before with Our remembrance, for We are ever remembering. The remembrance of thy Lord equals not all that is in the heavens and earth and what lies between them, and We are ever remembering in truth. All that thou hast witnessed in the Book is from thy Lord, and We are ever knowing of it. God shall soon recompense thee in the life to come and the present life with a goodly recompense from Him, for He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. We have indeed sent down aforetime this wisdom, and We are its Guardian. Had We not commanded thee thus, how couldst thou find a way to it? Say: All is from God, the Most High, the Most Great. But there returned not to God the essence of what was, all being given or taking by God's leave. And perchance cannot be counted what benefit those derived from that Command, and all before God are believers. But there returned not to Me a single verse We had sent down in that path - perchance not equaling a thousand. Thus does God testify in truth, for He is the Best of witnesses. But apart from that path, God ordained naught in the Book. God shall return to His proof, for He has power over all things. But this is the essence of what they have taken and shall take, and have come and shall come. This is from God's grace upon thee - He has given thee from Him what He willeth, then permitted thee what thou hast found a way to. This shall benefit thee on the Day of Resurrection before thy Lord. We have not diminished aught of what We gave thee. Our remembrance equals not what is in the heavens and earth and what lies between them, as all creation is before thy Lord and all bow down to Him. And thou hast not possessed of those thousand seals save a numbered few, and what thou hast worn and what is below that are those who believe in God and His signs, disposing by permission. This is what returned to God thy Lord, and He shall enrich thee with a mighty enrichment as recompense for following God's command. But witness that wealth was not anyone's glory when thou seest countless wealthy ones on earth possessing countless things like unto themselves, all possessing without right. And verily thy glory is in thy guidance and what God thy Lord hath enabled thee to fulfill of what thou wast commanded aforetime in the Book.

May God, thy Lord, grant thee success in that which was commanded aforetime in the Book, and verily this is, in the estimation of God, a supreme triumph. We have desired for thee from Our presence whatsoever beseemeth thee, inasmuch as the gift of thy Lord is unlike the gift of anyone else in all the worlds. It behooveth thee to know that it hath no likeness in all creation. We have given thee manifest verses, the like of which cannot be found in the heavens or the earth or in aught that lieth between them. This is thy Lord's gift unto the God-fearing, a bounty the like of which existeth not in the heavens, nor on earth, nor in aught between them, and all are powerless before it. Yet besides this, there appeareth from those who were created by God's command that which, should He relate it to Himself, is of His grace, for verily He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have forbidden that there should appear in thy presence aught that would sadden thee or harm the believers. And if We desire a matter, We shall mention it in the Book and then command thee regarding it, for verily We are All-Knowing. Thou hast desired only the good-pleasure of God through these glad-tidings, both in the life to come and in this life, for verily We are bountiful. God hath ordained for thee in the Ridvan that which will solace thine eyes, and this is of God's grace unto thee and unto those who have believed in God and His signs, and are God-fearing in His religion. We have guided thee to thy Lord's proof from the fruits of Paradise, for verily We are watchful. Say: Praise be to God Who provideth for whomsoever He willeth from His presence; we are all thankful unto Him. Say: All receive their sustenance from God Who provideth for whomsoever He willeth from His presence, and all stand ready at His bidding. That which thou hast sent with those fruits shall reach its destination by thy Lord's leave, for He is truly the Guardian, the Protector. Praise be to God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most ManifestGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the grandeur, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the likeness and similitude, Thine the station and sublimity, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the awesomeness and grandeur, Thine the might and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the dominion and power, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. All is Thine, O my God! Thy favors are more numerous than can be counted by those who number, and Thy blessings are too exalted for those who render thanks to encompass their praise. Unto Thee be praise, praise that would fill Thy heavens \[...\]

Such favors are too exalted for any praise to encompass them. Unto Thee be praise - praise that would fill Thy heavens and Thy earth and all that lies between them through Thy grace and generosity, and that would cause all things to attain the pinnacle of Thy love, nearness, and good-pleasure. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Self-Subsisting, Unique, Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Most Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. Thou hast ever been the One existing before all things, the Being after all things, the Creator above all things, the Essence with all things, yet hidden from all things. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life. Verily Thou diest not. Thou art a King whose sovereignty perisheth not, a Justice that wrongeth not, a Power that changeth not, and a Unity from whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third:In the Name of God, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His transcendence above all contingent beings, hath elevated Himself in His loftiness above all existing things, hath made Himself inaccessible in His remoteness above all created things, hath shown forth His power above all atoms, and hath demonstrated His independence above all who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes. He hath called Himself and all His creation to witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Sovereign. Then He called Himself and all His creation to witness to the One manifest in a line from Me which I have written - the First to be manifested at the Most Exalted Beginning. God hath filled His heaven and His earth with the testimony that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Glorified.The Fourth in the Fourth:In the Name of God, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive! Praise be to God, there is none other God but Him, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive! The glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whosoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen except the First Unity. Furthermore, I testify that the similitude of all names is as mirrors, and the similitude of what appeareth in them is as the sun reflected in the mirrors through the mirrors themselves. Therefore in all names none can be seen except God, whether they be the most exalted names or those beneath them, for their bearers are all, within their own limits, upon the height of greatness and the summit of loftiness. Call upon God, thy Lord, by all names, for all sources of radiance and manifestations of light are from God, the One, the All-Compelling. Therefore there is no independence save in God, no exaltation save in Him. None can join together in truth except God, and none can separate in truth except Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that are in the heavens and on the earth and between them glorify Him. There is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.And it hath four stages:The First in the First:In the Name of God, the Most Preceding, the Most Preceding! Say: God precedeth all who possess precedence. None in the heavens \[...\]

He hath four stations, the first whereof is the first. In the Name of God, the Most Antecedent of the Most Antecedent. Say: God is more antecedent than every possessor of antecedence. None in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign antecedence. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been antecedent, pre-existent, and precedent. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Praise be to God, before Whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them do glorify Him. Say: All are submissive unto Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the divine realm, then the strength and the celestial domain, then the dominion and the earthly realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who oppresseth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Glorified be He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through His command "Be," and it is. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: He is the Manifest over His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He is the One Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Say: He is the One Who standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and witnessing what it earneth. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye be knowing? They will surely say: God. Say: How then do ye not believe in Him upon Whom God sendeth down His verses? Say: Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye be knowing? They will surely say: Unto God. How then do ye veil yourselves from Him Whom God hath made His Proof unto you in the days of God?His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Splendid of the splendid, the Resplendent. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Majestic of the majestic, the Glorious. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Beautiful of the beautiful, the Comely. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Grand of the grand, the Magnificent. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Luminous of the luminous, the All-Light.

By God! The Light is indeed the All-Luminous, the All-Enlightening, the Most Effulgent. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, the Ever-Merciful. Unto God belongeth the words of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Ruling, the Most Wise, the Judge Supreme. Unto God belongeth the names of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Most Great, the All-Glorious, the Supreme. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Knowing, the Most Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Most Mighty. Unto God belongeth the good-pleasure of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Well-Pleased, the All-Pleasing, the Most Pleasant. Unto God belongeth the nobility of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Most Noble, the All-Ennobling, the Supreme. Unto God belongeth the invincibility of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Impregnable, the All-Protecting, the Most Invincible. Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Sovereign, the All-Ruling, the Supreme. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the Lord, the All-Possessing, the Sovereign. Unto God belongeth the praise of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is indeed the All-Praised, the Most Praiseworthy, the Ever-Praised.Recite thou these verses, for verily in them lieth that which will tranquilize thy heart from thy Lord. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. From the beginning of this Cause, which is the first Day of Resurrection, all shall be brought before God, thy Lord. Consider thou in the prayer from the mention of death unto resurrection eleven degrees; thus on the Day of Resurrection shall ye all be raised up. Say: The letter Ha is your root and the letter Vav your branch, wherein ye shall be raised up. We have indeed bestowed upon thee a temple in the form of Ha in thine outer form, then Vav in thine inner form. Thus do they begin in creation, and thus do all worship in an ancient creation. Say: This is the Most Great Name whereby all attain unto every good. Blessed are they who possess their temples from their Lord, and blessed are they who recite the verses of God in their temples.Say: This year is the year of the Balance which We have established, yet all are veiled therefrom. Give praise then unto God for having recognized thy Lord and for being among those who are assured of the signs of God. Say: These verses are sent down in truth for those in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them - through them shall ye be guided. Say: Through them did God establish the religion of Muhammad aforetime, and verily they are greater than the verses of all the Prophets combined. For were they not greater, God would not have abrogated through them what was revealed beforehand unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Will ye not reflect? Verily, all who are on earth worship God, thy Lord, in ways they know not. Therefore have We rendered them and their deeds as dust, and We were witness unto all things. Except for those who have believed in God and His verses in the Bayan - these have We mentioned and forgiven what their hands have wrought.

We have expunged their misdeeds and set aright their condition, and We desire to admit them into a mighty paradise. This is thy Lord's gift unto the God-fearing. Say: In the first life ye have a path of truth extended before you - all labor for aught beside God while ye labor for God. And in the latter life God hath created for you an abode in the highest heaven of moist and living pearls wherein ye shall dwell. Therein shall ye have whatsoever your souls desire, and God shall add unto you more. Verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.We have indeed perused thy letter and We were listening. Blessed are they who have believed in God and His signs and were among those possessed of certitude. For whoso hath guided thee unto this knowledge, this indeed is a mighty bounty. This is better in God's sight than all that thou hast done before, and thus doth God reward the doers of good. And verily what We commanded thee before when thou wert among the God-fearing - We were indeed aware of it. And if no right of Mine was incumbent upon thee, thou art not obligated henceforth. Take from thy brother, for We were keeping account. We desire naught from anyone save truth, and We judge not even to the weight of an atom except with truth, though all are Ours and all stand ready at Our command. This is God's path in the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And if it becomes incumbent upon thee henceforth, then reckon it thyself, for We were keeping account.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm, then the Glory and the Majesty, then the Countenance and the Beauty, then the Face and the Perfection, then the Might and the Action, then the Authority and the Justice, then the Likeness and the Similitudes, then the Stations and the Grandeur, then the Greatness and the Independence, then the Glory and the Inaccessibility, then the Power and the Transcendence, then the Joy and the Gladness, then the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the Kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, bringing all things into being, and transcendent above all things. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Unique, Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Protector, Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou ordained all things and measured them with precise measure. By Thy sign hast Thou formed all things and fashioned them with perfect fashioning. Thou hast ever been supreme above all contingent beings, manifest above all existent things, inaccessible above all created things, exalted above all atoms, transcendent above all who dwell in the earthly realm \[...\]

Exalted above all who dwell in the realms of earth and heaven, empowered over all things, and dominant over all that hath been and shall be created through His originating power. Thou didst make Thyself known on the Day of Resurrection unto all Thy creation, whereby Thou didst distinguish among Thy creatures between those who recognized Thee and turned to Thee - upon whom Thou didst bestow Thy light, Thy good-pleasure, Thy love and Thy acceptance - and those who were veiled from Thee, whom Thou didst condemn to Thy fire and deprivation of Thy good-pleasure. How transcendent is Thy grace unto them that know Thee, and how glorious Thy bounty unto them that glorify Thee! The dwellers of Thy heaven and earth, and all that lies between them in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation, were created to worship Thee, to glorify Thee, to sanctify Thee, to magnify Thee and to extol Thee. Thou art exalted above all Thy creation and abiding after the extinction of Thy servants.Therefore, O my God, send Thy blessings upon the Tree of Thy Oneness - its root, branch, twigs, leaves, and fruits, and all that is in it and upon it, and upon such of Thy servants and loved ones as have found rest beneath that Tree - in a measure befitting the loftiness of Thy sovereignty and the sublimity of Thy dwellers. Verily, Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Therefore, send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection through Thy might and exaltation, Thy sanctity and glory, Thy generosity and bounty. Verily, Thou art triumphant over all things, above all things, omnipotent over all things, and after all things. Thou art the First, and there is nothing before Thee; Thou art the Last, and there is nothing after Thee; Thou art the Manifest, and there is nothing above Thee; Thou art the Hidden, and there is nothing beyond Thee. Verily, Thou art the Living, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Ancient of the Most Ancient. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath triumphed in His triumph over all created things, Who hath manifested Himself in His manifestation above all existing things, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath demonstrated His power above all atoms. His creation beareth witness, and He Himself testifieth, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the Bestower. This is a testimony purified from the allusions of signs and freed from the evidences of veils - a testimony resplendent, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, luminous, transcendent, mighty, powerful, manifest, hidden, sovereign, dominant, prevailing, well-pleasing, beloved, glorious, and preeminent. It is a testimony that filleth the heavens to their confines and the earth with all that is therein and thereon, and whatever lieth between them, through what hath been ordained by their Lord: that there is none other God but Him, the Eternal Almighty, the Everlasting All-Powerful, the Perpetual All-Compelling, the Single All-Prevailing. His are the most beautiful names in their primordial \[...\]

To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names in their Primacy and their Finality, their Outwardness and their Inwardness, and the Most Exalted Similitudes in their Essence and their Abstraction, their Purity and their Luminosity. He hath chosen for Himself an impregnable Essence, a resplendent Abstraction, an exalted Reality, a subtle Luminosity and an ancient Purity. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it and cast into its essence the likeness of itself. And lo, His signs appeared through it and filled the kingdom of His heaven and His earth, testifying that there is no God but Him and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word, and that the Manifestations of the Living One are His primary guides. He revealed Himself unto it through it by infinite names, whereupon the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them were filled with the multiplicity of that Primal Unity and that Light shining forth from the Morn of Eternity, all proclaiming: "God beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. His are the names in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved."The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Precedent, the Most Precedent. Praise be to God, beside Whom there is no other God, the Most Precedent, the Most Precedent. And verily all glory be from God unto the Primal Unity and unto him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that God, exalted and glorified be He, precedeth all things without conjunction, connection, separation or disconnection. The likeness of God's Revelation, glorified be His majesty, is as the sun, and the likeness of the darkened mirrors is as that creation - whosoever faceth the Sun of Truth, in him is reflected the likeness of its Revealer, each according to his capacity and station. And verily the difference among names proceedeth only from that which is named, though naught appeareth therein save God, the One, the Precedent, the Peerless, the Most High, the True.Look thou unto those who have hastened unto the Ridvan. Verily among those from thy land who have been mentioned before Us are two whose ranks God hath elevated in the lofty heights and the stations of those near unto Him. Thus doth He bestow His favor upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants through precedence in entering the Ridvan and beholding the Maids of Heaven and the Daysprings of Manifestation in Paradise. Blessed are they and that which they have earned in their Lord's path. And if they have not the means to support themselves, then surely provide for them from thy Lord, for verily We shall recompense thee. We shall assuredly reckon with thee, for they have been raised to a mighty seat of truth. It behooveth their Lord Who created them to provide for their affairs - verily He is the best Guardian and Trustee. However, this is only if they lack sufficient means; otherwise God their Lord hath provided for them, for verily He is All-Knowing, All-Wise.And it hath four stations. The First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most High. Say: God is supreme above all who possess supremacy. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been supreme in His transcendent sovereignty. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom bow down in adoration all who are in the heavens and on earth and between them! Say: All are His worshippers. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and on earth and between them celebrate His glory! Say: All are submissive to Him.God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the Sovereign and the Kingdom, then the Might and the Dominion, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Dominion and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Supreme One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He is, verily, powerful over all things.Blessed be He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God is the Creator of all things, and all are submissive to Him. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and all bow down before Him. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and all stand firm by His command. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is manifest above His creation, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.He is the One Who createth what He willeth by His command "Be" and it is. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation and the Manifest above His servants, and He is the Single, the Inaccessible, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: He is the One Who standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and witnessing what it shall earn. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of hidden things. And if thou shouldst ask all who are in the heavens and on earth and between them "Who created you and sustaineth you and causeth you to die and giveth you life?" all would say "God is the Creator of all things and we are all His worshippers."Say: How then do ye worship God in a way that profiteth you not but rather harmeth you, and ye know it not? Say: These are the verses of God, a proof from Him unto all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven and between them. Through them ye turn unto God, your Lord.O thou who art numbered among those who withdraw! What thou hast written hath been spread before Us, and We have been attentive. Praise be to God, the Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all the worlds, for what God hath taught thee of guidance from His presence and made thee among the witnesses.Say: O God! Thou art the Sovereign of sovereigns. Thou givest sovereignty to whom Thou willest and takest it from whom Thou willest. Thou enrichest whom Thou willest and makest poor whom Thou willest. Thou helpest whom Thou willest \[...\]

Thou shalt aid whom Thou pleaseth and forsake whom Thou pleaseth, and Thou shalt exalt whom Thou pleaseth and abase whom Thou pleaseth. Within Thy grasp lieth the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willeth by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Thou causeth the night to pass into day and the day to pass into night. Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and Thou sustaineth whom Thou willeth without measure. No partner hast Thou in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou createst whom Thou willeth by Thy command. Verily, Thou dost encompass all things.Behold on the Day of Resurrection how the people have veiled themselves from God, their Lord, while they perceive not. All worship God and strive for His good pleasure, yet God beareth not witness to their guidance. Their example is like unto those who were given the Book aforetime, yet they know not. We have granted them respite for a numbered period, that perchance they may be reminded of the signs of God.Say: We have revealed aforetime in the Furqan that none other than God can reveal a verse. Perchance on the day they hear the verses of God they may be convinced that none other than God can reveal a verse. Thus there is no doubt that it hath been revealed from God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. For We have shown this path to mankind and have witnessed it through twelve hundred and seventy years. Thus doth God cast His decree upon them, yet they perceive not.Behold how We have seized them by that which they profess. Say: Can your religion be established save through Muhammad, the Messenger of old, and that which God hath revealed through His verses? How then do ye not understand nor take heed? This is the proof whereby God hath established the religion of Islam, if ye but knew. All that ye see or say - God beareth not witness to your guidance. In the Furqan naught was adduced save verses, if ye would but ponder a little thereon.If ye say this sufficeth not, then look ye to the word of God revealed aforetime in the Surih of the Spider, then believe in your former religion. This is the proof of God, if ye would perceive. And by conclusive rational proof, if anyone wished to enter the religion of Islam, ye could not adduce any evidence save this proof, if ye would perceive. For all that ye say returneth to this, and none who wisheth to enter your religion heareth aught except that he seeth a verse which all the worlds are powerless to produce. Thus hath the proof of thy Lord been completed against those who entered not aforetime into Islam and those who enter not afterwards into the Bayan, even should they become aware. And were the people of Islam to realize what their hands have wrought, they would be thunderstruck and would testify, for they all know from the beginning of their lives until their end that they might attain God's good pleasure. But can His good pleasure be manifested except through His verses? Say: What then will ye do?

Will approval be manifested save through His signs? Say: What aileth you that ye act thus and perceive not? Ye have become veiled from the fruits of your deeds, and this is a day whereon ye shall be brought before God, your Lord. Verily We shall bring back in the number of Ha and Vav those who are in Islam, and We shall create them anew in a wondrous creation, and yet they \[...\]

They know not, and death has been decreed until it reaches the Balance from among the degrees of the Day of Resurrection in the number of the letter Waw, but the people are veiled from the Cause of God. We have made thee a witness unto what hath been sent down from Our presence, that thou mayest be of them that know. When knowledge conformeth to what He desireth, that is knowledge and wisdom with God and then with those who are endowed with knowledge and who believe in God's Cause. Otherwise it is not considered knowledge in the sight of God. Will their principles, or logic, or meanings, or what is above or below these, profit them on the Day of Resurrection? Nay, these have veiled them from the path of God and caused them to enter the fire with those who enter therein.Therefore, make thy knowledge that which hath been sent down from God, the Most High, the Most Great, the Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them, the One, the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful. This verily is thy glory in the life to come and in this first life, and then in all the worlds. And strengthen the hearts of them that dwell in the precincts of the Ridvan, for this is of God's grace unto the doers of good. And do good unto those who remain after those who have ascended unto God, for this is of God's bounty unto the beneficent ones who have met their Lord and who were certain of the signs of God.Guard thyself, then thy believing brethren, from that which harmeth you, for verily We have been their protector. But if thou desirest to be among the teachers on a certain day, then travel by thy Lord's leave and call the people unto the path of certain truth. Otherwise, be patient until God bringeth His command to pass. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is of God's grace upon thee and upon those who desire to help the Cause of God and who turn with longing unto God, their Lord.And verily We were witness to what thou hast calculated in the Book. That which belongeth to God reacheth His loved ones not in the manner ye reckon. We have indeed sent down Tablets; recite them unto their people and remind them of the days of thy Lord, for this is of His grace unto the God-fearing. And as for what thou hast asked of God, thy Lord, regarding a goodly progeny, should God so will, He will grant it unto thee. He is verily the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.And when thou desirest to draw nigh, recite that verse from the Book, for this is a beautiful remembrance. Say: God is more beautiful than every possessor of beauty. None in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them can withhold himself from the sovereignty of His beauty. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, is beautiful, the Source of beauty, the All-Beauteous.And when thou knowest of a matter, safeguard the days that pass that thou mayest make its provision a gentle provision, for this is of God's grace unto those who have believed in the Bayan and those who shall believe thereafter. Should ye recite this and preserve the days of its gestation, God will fashion what ye, when ye behold it, shall cause you to say: "Glory be to God, the Possessor of Glory and Beauty! This is of God's handiwork, the Supreme, the Transcendent."The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee.

And all things testify that Thou art God, and there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine is might and omnipotence, Thine is power and divinity, Thine is strength and earthly dominion, Thine is glory and majesty, Thine is the countenance and beauty, Thine is the face and perfection, Thine is mercy and bounty, Thine is sovereignty and justice, Thine are the symbols and parables, Thine are the stations and grandeur, Thine is greatness and independence, Thine is guardianship and sublimity, Thine is might and invincibility, Thine is guardianship and transcendence, Thine is dominion and power, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou wert before all things, and Thou art the Being after all things, and Thou art the Essence after all things, and Thou art the Creator of all things, and Thou art the Knower of all things. From everlasting Thou hast been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, ever-living, all-compelling, sovereign, all-pervading, holy, everlasting, never-ending, transcendent, invincible, exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. I shall magnify Thee, O my God, with great magnification, and I shall glorify Thee, O my God, with mighty glorification. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third of the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, and hath made Himself invincible in His invincibility above all created things, and hath shown His power in His might above all atoms, and hath demonstrated His dominion in His sovereignty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. He hath chosen an impenetrable essence, a resplendent abstraction, a sublime being, a delicate camphor-like nature, and an exalted simplicity. Then He revealed Himself to it through it and cast into its reality the likeness of itself, whereupon His actions appeared through it and He filled His heaven and earth with it, testifying that there is no God but Him, the One, the Ancient. Verily the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. Through Him God hath manifested whatsoever He willeth of the paths of all things, for in His grasp is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. There is no God but Him, the One, the Supreme.The Third of the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous. Praise be to God, there is no God but Him, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen except the First One.

And whoso resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the Primal One. And furthermore, bear thou witness that God, the All-Glorious, hath revealed Himself unto His names through them, by them, and through them hath withheld Himself from them. Thus is the Manifest in them the Hidden before them, and the First in them the Last unto them. Liken them unto mirrors and that which is reflected unto the sun, even as there appeareth loftiness or precedence, or lowliness or distinction, or the likeness of these attributes and the shadows of those names from the evidences of the Bayan. This is what behooveth to be attributed unto God, the Mighty, the Most High. And whatsoever is beneath this, even though it be through God, yet since it entereth not into the Bayan, it behooveth not to be attributed unto God, the Lord of Glory and Majesty. Therefore, the highest exaltation of every Revelation is made the lowest abasement of the Revelation that followeth it; nay, the paradise of the former Revelation is made the fire of the subsequent one. For whoso was in the former Revelation, should he not enter into the subsequent Revelation, his light is changed into fire. Likewise, whoso believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest on the day of His appearance, his light in the Bayan shall be changed into fire. Say: O people of the Bayan! Ye are they who on that day shall fear, for that is a day like unto this time when all do call upon Him, yet all remain veiled from Him, save those who know God and then turn unto Him through His names. These are they who on the Day of Resurrection shall be secure; no grief shall touch them on that day, and they shall abide in the lofty chambers of their glory. And it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Restful, the Most Restful. There is no God but He, the Most Restful, the Most Restful. Say: God is more restful than every possessor of rest. None in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them can withstand the sovereignty of His rest. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Resting, the Most Restful, the Bestower of Rest. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All stand in devotion before Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And exalted be He Who possesseth the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: In all names naught is seen save God.

And whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: In all names naught can be seen except God, and all testify that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: When something is created by God's command, ye call upon Him, and when sustenance is bestowed by God's command, ye call upon Him. Say: Verily, He Who created you is He Who sustaineth you. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. When death cometh upon a thing, ye call upon Him, and when life appeareth in a thing, ye call upon Him. Say: Verily, He Who causeth you to die is He Who giveth you life. Will ye not see? Before Him boweth down whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Best-Beloved. This is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He is the One Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be" and it is. He is the One Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Unto Him submit whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All shall return unto Him. Say: He standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and bearing witness to what it acquireth. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: Through God's grace and mercy ye shall enter the chambers of paradise. Say: God hath ordained in the Mother Book the measures of all things; all act according to His command. Say: God hath created the tree of negation and affirmation, and hath commanded you not to approach negation, as ye know, and to draw nigh unto God through the tree of affirmation, as ye call upon Him. Say: All that ye witness in truth ye shall exchange for that which is other than Him, then fear ye God. And what God witnesseth concerning those who have believed in God and His signs is better than what all the worlds witness. And there hath been spread before God the Book which was inscribed from thence, and We were indeed aware of it. And We were indeed listeners to what was inscribed from thence. God shall soon exalt those who have believed in God and His signs and enrich them from His bounty. Verily He hath ever been bountiful and all-knowing. And through what I have mentioned, the mercy of God hath descended upon thy father. Thus doth God reward the believers who, when they hear the mention of God, are assured of His command. Say: Those who have heard My mention and who believe forthwith - upon them rest blessings from their Lord and mercy, and they are the guided ones. And those who hear the mention of God and believe not - these have been created for the fire and shall enter therein after their death, and therein shall they find no help. And the proof of thy Lord hath been completed against all who dwell in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them through five evidences which all comprehend. Say: The first is what God revealed aforetime in the Furqan (Qur'an), in which all believe. Verily none but God can reveal a single verse, so when ye hear it, there remaineth no path for you in your religion except \[...\]

Say: Between them are five proofs which all can comprehend. The first is what God hath revealed aforetime in the Qur'an, in which all believe. Verily, none but God can reveal a single verse. When ye hear it, ye have no recourse in your religion except to say: "This is from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting." This sufficeth you according to what ye have acknowledged before in the Book of God, if ye be of those who are certain. Ponder what God hath revealed in the Surih of the Spider, if ye reflect upon the verses of God. The third proof is that these verses are greater than the verses of all the Prophets combined, for through these verses God hath exalted all that was revealed to the Prophets before Muhammad. Were they not greater, God would not establish this and abrogate what was revealed before, as ye in your religion do argue. The fourth proof is that God in the Qur'an only proves your powerlessness through the verses revealed therein. If there were aught else with God besides this, He would surely have used it as proof in the Book, if ye be of those who are certain of what God hath revealed. All that ye say must establish what equateth with God's proof, else God would not desire its mention. How is it that ye do not reflect? The fifth proof is one that ye comprehend through your own minds. When one desireth to enter the religion of Islam, do ye prove it to him through aught besides the verses of God? If ye say otherwise, then your own souls would belie you. Verily, whoso desireth to enter your religion heareth from you only what he seeth and whereby his heart is assured. How then do ye prove it to others while failing to prove it to yourselves through God's verses? And if ye say God's proof is not complete hereby, then according to your words there would be no proof in the Book for those who had not yet entered Islam. How is it that ye do not understand and see? Say: This is what God hath established for you aforetime in the Qur'an, in which ye all believe. But we have not argued what ye cannot comprehend through your minds nor encompass in knowledge. Is there any god besides God who createth? Say: Glory be to God! All are created by His command and all worship Him. Say: God hath subdued the letters and revealed them in such wise that all are rendered powerless. Is there any power that equateth this? God sendeth down words that render all the worlds powerless, though all speak with these same letters. If all are powerless to produce verses like these, how much more their powerlessness to grasp their meaning or comprehend their stations or what God hath reckoned therein of seventy thousand meanings which ye cannot encompass in knowledge. This is God's handiwork, if ye would but reflect a little. And verily we witnessed the Day of Resurrection when Truth was distinguished from falsehood according to what was ordained therein. Thy father had composed a book while we were listening to words in the most holy land \[...\]

Verily We have witnessed on the Day of Resurrection how truth was purified from that which was ordained therein through negation. Thy father composed a book while We were in the most holy land, hearing the words therein, though this be that whereof the chosen servants of God speak not. Yet God loveth him who seeketh to be purified from aught else save truth in like manner, if he be of them that know. And that which he knew and composed, were his knowledge to be revealed, would be inscribed as good in the sight of God in a mighty tablet. God created knowledge only that it might be acted upon, yet among men are those who utter words while remaining veiled from acting upon them. When one declareth "There is no God but God" and desireth to be among the doers, he must, if able, purify himself from all that leadeth not to God, negating negation through truth and affirming affirmation through truth, until naught remaineth of that which God's knowledge encompasseth of negation save in distant extinction, and naught remaineth that is established for God or that leadeth to God except in mighty and glorious permanence. And whoso composeth poetry concerning the First Unity, being on the Day of Resurrection among the assured ones, God shall give him two thousand degrees in Paradise of ruby wine wherein he shall ascend by God's leave. Thus doth God reward the truthful. And whoso composeth poetry concerning the companions of the fire, He shall cause him to descend into the fire. Therefore say: O all things! Speak ye for God's sake and speak not for aught else save God, except concerning that which God hath spoken of them and sent down His vengeance upon them, that ye may be delivered on the Day of Resurrection. Compose ye for Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection whatsoever ye are able, for verily all that ye imagine cannot attain unto an atom of His Cause, and ye are powerless to comprehend that which God hath ordained for Him. Glorified be He above all that the rememberers remember, and exalted be the Manifestation of His Self above all that the affirmers affirm. Say: Verily the praise of all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them is, in the sight of Him Whom God shall make manifest, as a drop compared to the seas of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and We seek forgiveness for this. Indeed such praise beseemeth not him whom God hath chosen for Himself and made a mirror reflecting His glory unto all worlds. But your praise of Him is limited by what your hands have wrought and what ye continue to work. If on the day of His manifestation ye believe in Him and in what God revealeth unto Him - Say: Verily God hath angels in the highest Paradise who compose words in His praise, were but one of these words to be revealed unto all who are on earth, they would all at once fall swooning. Say: Who is able to praise God, his Lord, when all are His servants and all are devoutly obedient unto Him? He it is before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them, and all seek to praise Him. He it is concerning Whom it hath been revealed in all the heavenly Books: Worship none but God, my Lord \[...\]

He is the One Who hath been revealed in all the heavenly Books: that ye shall worship none but God, my Lord and your Lord, for this is a straight and certain path. And He it is Who hath sent forth all the Messengers, saying: Follow naught but what hath been revealed from God, and be ye of them that are assured of His signs. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and all are subservient unto Him. Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Splendid, the All-Splendid, the Resplendent. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the All-Majestic, the Glorious. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Beautiful, the All-Beautiful, the Beauteous. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Grand, the All-Grand, the Magnificent. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Luminous, the All-Luminous, the Light-Giving. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Merciful, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Unto God belongeth the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Wise, the All-Wise, the Judge. Unto God belong the names of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Great, the All-Great, the Supreme. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Mighty, the All-Mighty, the Powerful. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Knowing, the All-Knowing, the Omniscient. Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Powerful, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Loving, the All-Loving, the Beloved. Unto God belongeth the honor of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Honored, the All-Honored, the Noble. Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Sovereign, the All-Sovereign, the Supreme. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Supreme, the All-Supreme, the King. Unto God belongeth the loftiness of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the All-Exalted, the High. Unto God belongeth the victory of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Victorious, the All-Victorious, the Helper. Unto God belongeth the protection of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them, and God is the Most Protecting, the All-Protecting, the Guardian. Those who desire to possess the knowledge of inner mysteries in the essences should recite these verses, for this would be better for them in the sight of God and nearer than that for which they toil night and day. These are the verses of the One; God hath sent down in them the keys to all things, all according to what God hath ordained. Verily the mercy of God is upon those who have believed in God and His signs, and those who shall believe thereafter. It hath four stages. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Sublime, the Most Sublime. There is no God but He, the Most Sublime, the Most Sublime. Say: God is more sublime than all who are sublime. None in the heavens \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! There is no God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! Say: God is more exalted than any who possess exaltation. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can withstand the sovereignty of His exalted dominion. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Exalted, the Most High, the Supreme.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. Praise be to God, unto Whom offer praise all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All stand humbly before Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God hath indeed ascended His Cause, and all are equal in the sight of God, would ye but perceive it. Should the most exalted among creation turn unto God, such are the believers, and should the lowliest of creation turn unto God, such are the believers. And should the highest or lowest among creation be veiled from God, then God loveth not that they be mentioned.Therefore fear God, O all things, from the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for ye know not whether this is He Whom God shall make manifest. Nay, even should He make Himself known unto you after His manifestation, then would ye hear and know. Therefore have mercy upon yourselves, that ye transgress not the bounds of the Bayan, and grieve not any soul, that this may return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest while ye know not. Say: That which returneth unto Him returneth unto God, if ye be assured of God's signs.Say: He is the Subduer above you, the Manifest over you, the Mighty at your right hand, the Exalted at your left, the Transcendent above your heads, the Sovereign beneath your feet, and the Powerful from every direction that reacheth you. He guardeth you by night and by day through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Say: Through these seven Names mentioned in this verse shall ye be saved on the Day of Resurrection if ye seek shelter beneath the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Consider ye the names in the Gospel, for verily those who sought not shelter beneath Muhammad's shadow profited not from God's names therein. Thus shall ye be tested on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. If ye believe in Him, then are ye guides unto God.

...and the day, by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: By these seven Names mentioned in that verse, ye shall be saved on the Day of Resurrection if ye seek shelter beneath the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Look ye unto the names of the Gospel, for verily whoso sought not shelter beneath the shadow of Muhammad, the names of God therein profited him not. Thus shall ye be tested on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. If ye believe in Him, then are ye guides unto God; else how can ye be names when ye give no tidings of Him Whom ye name? Say: Verily, naught in the heavens or on earth or between them can comprehend God, nor can His names comprehend Him. He is the Self-Sufficient, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted. God hath singled out certain of His servants who can recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest; thus do ye comprehend God and His names. Ye comprehend only these true Names in creation. Glorified be God above what they ascribe unto Him. God created His servants and all are submissive unto Him. He is the One Whom nothing in the heavens or earth or between them can comprehend. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. If God's power were the power of creation, how could ye not lift a command from yourselves or establish the like thereof among all names? All are His servants and all stand by His command. Say: All beautiful names belong to God, manifested only through Him Whom God shall make manifest. What ye comprehend of bounty is but an atom of the revelation of His bounty, and what ye comprehend of grace is but an atom of what God hath revealed of His grace. Similarly do ye deduce all names. Since God is the Self-Sufficient, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, God hath ordained for the Manifestation of His names Him Whom God shall make manifest. Ye bear witness to this mention, and through His evidences do ye comprehend all His beautiful names as revealed unto them through them by His command. Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Glory - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Majesty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Beauty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Grandeur - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Light - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Mercy - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Supreme Glory - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Might - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Awe - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Power - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Strength - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Sovereignty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Loftiness - will ye not glorify Him? If ye suppose yourselves to be the thrones of God, then when He Whom God shall make manifest maketh Himself known unto you, ye shall recognize yourselves as the thrones of God in all His beautiful names as they are revealed unto you through you by your own selves, for this is what God hath attributed unto Himself, if ye be of them that love this. Say: The All-Merciful is established upon the Throne. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

And in His Proofs are all His most beautiful names, inasmuch as He hath revealed Himself unto them through them by His command - this ye can comprehend. Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Glory - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Majesty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Beauty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Grandeur - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Light - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Mercy - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Supreme Greatness - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Might - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Awe - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Power - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Strength - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Sovereignty - will ye not glorify Him? Say: God hath established Himself upon the Throne of Loftiness - will ye not glorify Him?If ye imagine that ye are the thrones of God, then at the time when He Whom God shall make manifest shall make Himself known unto you, ye shall recognize that ye are indeed the thrones of God in all His most beautiful names that are revealed unto you through your own selves, for this is what God hath attributed unto Himself, if ye be of them that love this.Say: The All-Merciful is established upon the Throne. To Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All stand firm through His command. His are the most beautiful names. All that are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify Him. There is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.The Sovereign is established upon the Throne. To Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth beneath the soil. God, there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Exalted. His are the most beautiful names in the kingdom on high unto the lowest depths.The second in the second. In the name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect.Glorified art Thou, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine is the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine is the Power and the Divine Realm, Thine is the Strength and the Treasured Realm, Thine is the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine is the Might and the Majesty, Thine is the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine is the Face and the Perfection, Thine is the Mercy and the Bounty, Thine is the Authority and the Justice, Thine is the Power and the Action, Thine is the Similitude and the Examples, Thine is the Station and the Glory, Thine is the Grandeur and the Supreme Greatness, Thine is the Awe and the Radiance, Thine is the Might and the Invincibility, Thine is the Power and the Transcendence, Thine is the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Eternal, Alone, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Encompassing, Most Holy, Everlasting. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. Therefore, O my God, do Thou nurture all who are in the Bayan with the gems of knowledge and wisdom, not with that which shall profit or harm them on the Day of Resurrection.

Praise be unto God Who hath caused all jewels of knowledge and wisdom to rest in His good-pleasure with His servant, and this can only be manifested through the good-pleasure of Him Whom He shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. When one knoweth himself, then doth he find the path to Thy good-pleasure, whether he be learned in all knowledge or knoweth naught. This is true in the day of Thy Manifestation, and in the days of Thy concealment Thy ways in the Bayan are manifest beyond count and Thy dawning-places in the Bayan are resplendent beyond concealment.Protect, O my God, Thy loved ones from that which profiteth them not from the inventions of their learning, and nurture them through the delight of reciting Thy verses and beholding Thy words, and through observing Thy bounty and refraining from that which Thou hast forbidden, and through glorification at all times, for this is the best of deeds in Thy sight.Glorified art Thou, O my God! How exalted is Thy grace and beneficence, how lofty Thy generosity and favor! Thou hast made the degrees of knowledge like unto the degrees of creation, and hast distinguished the people of Thy love with the knowledge of Thy love and good-pleasure and intimacy and glory. Preserve us, O God, from all this and elevate us through what Thou hast revealed in the Bayan during the days of Thy concealment. Send down, O God, upon my parents and those who love me, whether of the past or future, from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end, that which befitteth the loftiness of Thy existence, the sublimity of Thy grace, the exaltation of Thy remembrance, the inaccessibility of Thy favors, Thy glory, and that which Thou art in Thy names and similitudes and manifestations and verses and words and evidences.For verily Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be the One existing before all things, subsisting after all things, transcending all things, dwelling beneath all things, and abiding after the passing of all things. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou hast power over all things.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the Most Sublime, the Most Sublime. Praise be to God Who hath established Himself upon the throne of dominion and kingdom through the exaltation of the majesty of His oneness, then established Himself upon the throne of might and omnipotence through the exaltation of the beauty of His eternality, then established Himself upon the throne of power and divinity through the glory of the lights of His countenance, then established Himself upon the throne of strength and sublimity through the transcendence of the loftiness of His elevation, then established Himself upon the throne of sovereignty and human realm through the splendor of the radiance of His dominion. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but Him, eternally ancient in the eternity of eternities, and He hath ever been and will ever be eternally ancient, never ceasing and never ending. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that the Essence of the Seven Letters hath chosen Him for Himself and hath manifested unto Him with all created things the capacity of Him Whom He shall make manifest today and the exaltation of the path of Him Whom He shall elevate.

In exaltation of the path of those who uplift it, in glorification of the word of those who give it sovereignty, in support of the victory of those who render it triumphant, in magnification of the might of those who possess it, in manifestation of the revelation of those who reveal it, and in glorification of the majesty of those who preserve it from all that they would not desire for themselves. Blessed are they who make themselves proofs of God's good-pleasure therein, for these are the dawning-places of God's Cause and the daysprings of glory through whom God manifests His proof as He willeth. And He Whom God shall make manifest will appear on the Day of Resurrection with sovereignty and independence, with grandeur and majesty over all things. From God and from all things upon Him and upon the proofs of His Cause be every glory, majesty, beauty, greatness, light, mercy, might, loftiness, power, grandeur, all-encompassing nature, knowledge, strength, love, sovereignty, nobility, dominion, kingdom, guidance, words, verses, and whatsoever befitteth God of His most excellent Names and most exalted Attributes. For whatsoever God hath willed for Him is all goodness, and if the servant doth not will for Him all goodness, how can he be a servant of God? O people of the Bayan! Guard yourselves lest ye be veiled from His Will in His Proof, for God hath willed for Him all goodness while ye will it not. Verily your destruction lieth in this and naught else, if ye but perceive it. Draw nigh unto God by willing for His Proof what God hath willed for Him, for your contentment and salvation lie in this, if ye but know it. The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. And verily the glory from God is upon the First One and upon whoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen except the First One. And furthermore, I bear witness that God, glorified be He, hath \[...\]

Verily have human temples been created in such wise that they should be the thrones of the manifestation of God, and this represents man's exaltation above all others of his kind. For if thou dost submit to Him Whom God shall make manifest and to His manifestations, then art thou a throne for God and His revelations. Otherwise, thou art like all other created things, at the level of inanimate objects, unworthy to be a throne for God, even though every thing in its own existence beareth some manifestation of its Lord. Yet the honor belongeth to man inasmuch as he comprehendeth this. And verily the throne which God hath chosen for Himself is none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all else are thrones for His revelations. Therefore, hasten to attain this grace, for herein lieth your glory and splendor, not in what ye possess.They desire naught except what He desireth, and He desireth naught save what God, glorified and exalted be He above all description, desireth. Through His manifestation He hath been established upon all things, that all might testify that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and that all things might proclaim that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Most Mighty, the Best-Beloved.His are four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Grieving, the Most Grieving. Say: God is more grieving than any who grieve. No sovereign can withstand the power of His grief, neither in the heavens nor on earth nor between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Grieving, the Griever, the Grief-Stricken.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them make their submission. Say: All are submissive unto Him.God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then Glory and Omnipotence, then Power and Divinity, then Might and Sovereignty, then Rule and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God hath ever been what He is, and no thing hath ever changed Him. All that ye behold in the Bayan - had ye heard from the heavenly Books of the past how the Primal Point attributed divine qualities to Himself, ye would likewise understand. Should He Whom God shall make manifest grieve, this is what God hath grieved. Will ye not then fear? Should He Whom God shall make manifest take vengeance, this is what God hath avenged. Will ye not then be apprehensive? O all things! From the beginning that hath no beginning until now, We have nurtured you in every manifestation that ye might be saved in the subsequent manifestation.

O all things! From the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment have We nurtured you in every Dispensation that ye might be saved in the subsequent Revelation. Yet ye showed no shame and perceived not what We intended for you, but followed your own desires in that which profiteth you not, and on the Day of Resurrection ye shall enter the Fire.We have traversed worlds innumerable, known to none save Us, until the First Creation; then from the First Creation until the day of Muhammad have We nurtured you in every Dispensation that ye might be saved. When We manifested Muhammad aforetime, We witnessed that every people stood within their bounds. We showed mercy unto you and commanded the Apostle in the religion of Islam that perchance ye might be saved in the latter day. The Apostle commanded you to make the religion of Islam victorious throughout the earth and whatsoever is thereon, and provided you with every means that ye might manifest what God had ordained for you.When We manifested the Seven Letters, We were witness that ye fulfilled not what We had ordained in the Qur'an and commanded you, but slumbered in your night and sported in your day, remaining veiled from God's command. Think ye that We provided you the means without right, or desired that ye should merely eat and sleep after hearing God's command? How is it ye helped not your Faith to triumph over all on earth, nor left anyone in the Fire without delivering him, that all on earth might be united in one Faith from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting?When that which ye were powerless to achieve had passed, God desired to cause you and them to enter the religion of the Bayan, that ye might attain unto His mercy. We nurtured you during the years of the Planting through the verses of the Qur'an that ye might be saved in the day of the subsequent Manifestation. We brought you therein five proofs whereby ye might attain certitude, that ye might be guided by these proofs in the subsequent Manifestation and traverse the path of God.Say: First, God adduced no proof in the Qur'an save verses that rendered you powerless - will ye not understand? Second, none but God can reveal a single verse - will ye not reflect? Third, this Book sufficeth you before God - will ye not be certain? Fourth, these verses are greater than the verses of the previous Prophets - will ye not believe? Fifth, God's proof hath been perfected unto all on earth, and should anyone desire to enter the religion of Islam through conclusive proofs from your own minds, he hath no way to deny after the Book - and ye all believe in these proofs.We nurtured you thus that ye might be saved in the subsequent Manifestation. Yet when We manifested that whereof ye were promised, with all these proofs and evidences from Us whereby ye might all attain certitude, ye turned not unto what God desired \[...\]

Let these proofs, all from Our presence, suffice you to attain certitude. Yet you turned away from what God intended and squandered your knowledge with what you fabricated from your principles, which are fit only as fodder for beasts, while calling yourselves pious and cautious. Though We toiled throughout Our life and learned the fundamentals of the knowledge of the Qur'an, We were among those who knew God's good-pleasure. Woe unto you! God's good-pleasure is manifest from His presence in clear verses, yet you trifle with your useless learning and imagine you are doing good in God's sight. It behooveth all who dwell on earth to embrace the Islamic Faith, that on the Day of Our manifestation they may bow down before Us, even as they have bowed from the beginning of their lives unto their end. We revealed Our Cause, whereupon kings and countless multitudes among the Muslims submitted. We severed Ourselves from the various sects and from the king who had believed in the Point of the Qur'an, yet remained veiled from the Letters of the One. We revealed Our Cause in five regions while all of you supplicated night and day for Our manifestation and professed belief in what was revealed in the Qur'an. We delivered the Book of the Qayyum in those regions and in the Holy Land whose people believed in the One of the Qur'an. When the number of the letter Ha was fulfilled, this was Our seat which God is not ashamed to mention, though you imagine yourselves to be doing good. Remember what transpired in the five regions and then in the Holy Land - yet how little do you remember! When We witnessed this, We were grieved and took vengeance upon you through Our Cause, for you are not believers in God's sight. Can any vengeance equal this, if you but perceived it? While you expect to be regarded as rightly guided and to receive His good-pleasure, God has testified that you act contrary to His good-pleasure. Would that you all had sensitive spirits; else God will surely raise up one who will make manifest in your souls the effects of that grief, and then you will remember. But you were not given the essence of knowledge, else at the time of the Cause you would either be blessed or tormented. For all who were slain in Islam were martyred on account of a single verse of the Qur'an. Yet when you recite the verses, having no grasp of their essence, you remain unmoved, though their impact be supreme. You exist at the level of minerals. How then can you enter into religion when their effects become manifest? Before their effects appear, you recite what none can count save God, yet remain unmoved, being fixed at the mineral level. What fire could be fiercer for you than to behold the proof of your Lord, yet remain veiled from Him, pass judgment upon Him, while imagining you do good? We were indeed independent of all things. We were truly grieved on account of you and shall take vengeance upon you. Inscribe this in your ears, that on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, you may not remain veiled as you are now. They supplicate for His manifestation and call upon Him, yet when God makes Him manifest in truth, they pay no heed.

Inscribe this upon your hearts that perchance on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, you will not remain veiled in like manner. They supplicate for His manifestation, then call upon Him; yet when God makes Him manifest in truth, you neither turn towards Him nor remember Him as you turned towards that which was promised unto you. In truth has the letter Ha descended and the proofs of the All-Merciful have been established on earth, yet you neither remember nor understand. You should weep over your condition insofar as you are able, and show mercy to yourselves according to your capacity. For what We possess, and what those who have believed in truth possess - would that you could understand! All that has appeared and shall appear - is it not from this Source, if you would but perceive it? Indeed, God has given you knowledge and wisdom that you might enter the gardens of truth at the time of understanding.Say: Those who have believed in God and His signs speak with proof from the Book of their Lord and with insight concerning their return and abode, and they are assured of God and His signs. Say: They are weightier than all that is in the heavens and earth and what lies between them. Indeed, through them is sustained the creation of all things, and they are God's proofs, and in God their Lord do they place their trust. These are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they are firm in the true religion. They see all that is on earth - should it not believe in Him - as less than a mosquito's wing, and they speak and reason with might and guidance. And should all on earth believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, it would be dearer to their hearts than their own selves, and they behold their relationship to their Lord.These are they whose motto from the beginning to the end of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest is to swim in the good-pleasure of the Truth. They glorify God their Lord, the All-Merciful, by night and by day, and they never cease. Blessed are they and that which they acquire of God's bounty. Should there remain but one person in the Bayan, God and the angels of the heavens and earth and all between them would surely proclaim: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye this One. And should all on earth believe in Him, God would surely send His blessings upon him and them.Say: All peoples shall surely attain this supreme bounty from God in the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then shall you all give thanks to God for having guided you to the path of truth, and become assured of God's command.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God. Grief, grief! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and Divinity, Thine the Strength and Glory, Thine the Sovereignty and the mortal realm, Thine the Majesty and Grandeur, Thine the Beauty and Countenance, Thine the Face and Perfection, Thine the Mercy and Bounty, Thine the Authority \[...\]

Thine is the might and the justice, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the station and majesty, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and dominion, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. My glory, O my God, lieth in my faith in Thee and in Thy signs, Thy veils and Thy guides, in beholding Thy words and taking delight in Thy verses. For shouldst Thou make me like unto this, Thou wouldst cause me to perish, and if it appeareth not after my death, Thou wouldst cause me to enter into that from which there is no escape. Therefore, O my God, aid me through Thy love and Thy good-pleasure and Thy fear in private and in public, and strengthen me through Thy proof on the Day when every proof of all shall be cut off before Thee save those who have held fast to Thy proof, O Lord of Lords! That is the Day whereon Thou wilt manifest him whom Thou wilt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. Every possessor of proof shall be cut off from all things through Thy conclusive truth, but whoso holdeth fast to Thy proof on that Day shall have his proof exalted. Send down, O my God, upon all who are in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation that which shall enable all to attain unto Thy good-pleasure, and cause all to behold Thy signs and Thy evidence. For verily Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and nothing in the kingdom of command and creation or below them defeateth Thee. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining, Sovereign, All-Encompassing, Most Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Grievous, the Most Grievous. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, and hath made Himself invincible in His invincibility above all created things, and hath shown His dominion in His sovereignty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath demonstrated His triumph in His victory over all atoms. I testify, and all His creation doth testify, that there is none other God but He, the One, the All-Compelling. Then I testify, and all His creation doth testify, to that which He hath revealed of Himself unto Himself concerning all that He hath created and will create, through the signs of His power and the manifestations of His might and the evidences of His grandeur and the proofs of His unity and the tokens of His eternity, that all may recognize that there is none other God but He, the One, the All-Wise.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Grievous, the Most Grievous. Praise be to God, there is none other God but He, the Most Grievous, the Most Grievous. And verily the splendor from God is upon the Primary Unity and upon such as resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity.

And whoso resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One, then bear thou witness that the sorrow of God is the sorrow of His Proof, for He, glorified and exalted be He, is far above being described by sorrow or being characterized by similitudes. And at the time of sorrow, the vengeance of God, glorified be His majesty, is made manifest. For the sorrow of God hath stations: the station of Command and the station of what followeth the Command. In the first is the portion of the rightly-guided sages and the accomplished divines, and in the second is the portion of them that dwell in the sea of limitations and abide beneath the shade of the tree of the finite. And after both these sorrows there appeareth that which causeth the veiled ones to tremble and the hearts of the believers to find peace. However, for all things there is a term and a book, and when a thing reacheth its appointed time and its book, then its causes are made manifest. Thou art at the beginning of every Revelation; therefore hold fast unto the Proof, for if thou rely upon it, the circumstances that appear from its Revealer will not alter thee, even as the Proofs before relied upon His proof and set aright what they heard concerning the circumstances of change. For that is the pinnacle of the Cause and the pathway of glory at the beginning of every Revelation. And though God multiply the manifestations of every Revelation through His power, He shall lift from hearts whatsoever occurs to them. Verily God hath established His loved ones upon the path of truth through His proof and hath given them knowledge, wisdom, guidance, insight and exalted, transcendent qualities that they might traverse thereby the ocean of creation and attain unto what God hath ordained for them from His presence. O number of the single in the land of Sad after the diminution of Dal! If thou art of them that are assured of what God hath sent down unto thee, then write with thine own hand, in the manner of this Book, the number of all things and convey it unto the worlds. Otherwise, by God, He is independent of thee and of all that hath been created or will be created, and all abide by His command. And it hath four ranks. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful. There is no God but He, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful. Say: God is more vengeful than any possessor of vengeance. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His vengeful sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Avenger, the Vengeful, the Wrathful. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby-essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens \[...\]

No one escapes His grasp, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lies between them. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily, He has power over all things. Blessed is He to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and in what lies between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and in what lies between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.Verily, I am God; there is no God but Me, and all else is My creation. Say: O My creation, fear ye Me! I have made Myself known to all things on the Day of Resurrection. Those who have recognized Me through My signs - these are they who are rightly guided. And I have taken vengeance upon those who knew Me not through My signs though they worship Me night and day, supposing themselves to be in My good pleasure, while I bear them no witness of My pleasure. Thus doth God take vengeance upon all who are veiled. No vengeance in God's knowledge is like unto this, if ye but knew. For the ultimate aim of all your deeds is My good pleasure, yet ye have veiled yourselves from this and earned My displeasure. Thus will God take vengeance upon you, for He is the Avenger, the Retributive, the Vengeful.Say: This will not harm Me nor My chosen ones. But ye should be certain that God hath witnessed against you without His good pleasure. How then do ye judge by your knowledge when ye cannot prevail? Nay, when the effects of what God hath testified appear on earth, there shall remain none who have not been testified to by God in truth. Thus shall ye be tested on the Day of Resurrection. Consider: were God to manifest Him Whom He shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection over all who are on earth, they would know, and should He testify against anyone without right, the witnesses of His Cause would destroy them before being given leave. Thus should ye fear God whether He manifests this or not, and upon the dust ye shall bear witness to the truth though ye follow not His Cause, while all in that moment stand firm by His command.When We looked upon the earth, We saw all nations deserving that We should make them among those against whom We take vengeance - those who in Islam believe in the Quran. Then when We looked among them, We saw none deserving Our vengeance save those who believe in the Imams of religion. And when We looked upon these and their words, We saw their religious authority centered in one on earth among their ulama who pride themselves on their certificates, and one in their worldly affairs on earth - the nine rulers, all of whom glory in his rule. We found none besides these two deserving Our vengeance. Were We to find their like among all on earth, We would requite them with crimson water like the dye of a vast ocean. Thus doth God love to take vengeance, for He is the Subduer, possessed of mighty strength. Thus doth God love to take vengeance, for He is Severe, possessed of mighty strength.Therefore I shall address both of them: When ye saw the verses of God in the Bayan, how did ye endure after God had taught all who are in Islam that none but God can reveal verses? How then do ye not believe in your religion after ye have seen that ye have no way except \[...\]

We found all that is on earth to recompense with waters of their redness like the flood of a mighty sea. Thus doth God love to wreak vengeance; verily He is the All-Conquering, possessed of awesome might. Thus doth God love to wreak vengeance; verily He is the Severe, possessed of awesome might. When I addressed them both with verses of the Qur'an, how was it when ye saw God's verses in the Bayan? Ye were patient after God had made known to all in Islam that none but God can reveal a single verse. How then do ye not believe in your religion after ye have seen there is no way for you except to say this is from the paths of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting? And ye say "Suffice us not what God revealed in the Surah of the Spider to turn you back?" How then do ye not attain certitude in what ye have believed? And ye say God hath revealed to the Prophets numerous verses of unity which ye see in the Qur'an. Then observe through these verses how God abrogated what was revealed before of verses of unity through verses of the Qur'an. Had it not been greater in God's sight and yours, how would God abrogate through it what was revealed before? Do ye not understand? Do ye not see that what was adduced in the Qur'an regarding Muhammad's appearance was only that it would render you powerless regarding the verses of the Qur'an? Do ye not perceive? And if anyone wished to enter your religion, have ye any proof besides the Book to show him? Say: Glory be to God above what ye say without knowledge! If ye say God's proof was not complete for him, God would not punish one who entered not Islam. And if ye say it was complete and perfect for those who entered not the religion of Islam, how then do ye not enter in face of that proof in the Bayan? Let Me show the extent of your divines' knowledge and those who follow you both, that ye may know yourselves. When Moses came with signs to Pharaoh, he was not content save to produce something in response. Look then at the extent of your faith, for it is less than Pharaoh's veil, though ye reckon yourselves as doers of good. This is the extent of your religion. And the extent of your worldly life is that when those whose hearts believe not in Muhammad saw verses that rendered all the worlds powerless, they built their worldly life by manifesting faith among the people. Yet the extent of your worldly life is less than these, though ye reckon yourselves as possessors. I have addressed you both that those beneath you may take account of themselves in their religion and worldly life, for they deserve not God's mention - nay, nothing deserves mention in truth. But this is your possibility if ye love and fear God. Watch then for Him Whom God shall make manifest, for ye prostrate yourselves before God. Say: We all prostrate to Him. Say: We all are devoted to Him. Say: All fear His justice and hope for His grace, and all are suppliants before Him. O people of the Bayan! Fear ye your own selves, for on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, your inner realities shall be exposed and ye shall remain in your remoteness just as nations before you remained.

And ye shall remain after your time as remained the nations before you, yet ye neither remember nor understand. Therefore have mercy upon your own selves and reflect upon all that hath been sent down unto you, that ye may follow the Truth even though ye may be sorely tried. This is but a drop from the ocean of God's might, were ye to be conscious thereof. O all things that ye worship! Consider what your hands have wrought, how ye have dealt with God, your Lord, and with those who are His chosen ones, and then behold how the Almighty, the All-Compelling, doth restrain Himself after your hands have committed that which God is ashamed to mention. Will ye not fear? Yet in the Bayan ye grieve not one another, lest ye cause grief to Him Whom God shall make manifest among you while ye perceive it not. Were it not for those who are well-pleasing unto Him, neither God's might nor His power would be restrained. But God hath sent down seventy thousand seas of good-pleasure through those who have ascended unto Him with their hearts, their spirits, their souls, their possessions, both in their return and their fixed abode - these are they who have attained. I address the first and the last of the Vahid: Verily ye have known your Lord, and ye and those who follow you are the triumphant ones. Were all who are on earth to gather together in love for you two for the sake of God, He would create naught of fire.

Thus doth God send down the dawning-places of grace from His presence, that ye may be thankful. Say: They who take vengeance for Him Whom God shall make manifest against those who believe not in Him - these are the proofs of these Names. God loveth them with an exceeding love, inasmuch as they take vengeance in the religion of God, turn to God their Lord for proof, and show kindness and beneficence unto those who believe in God.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful! Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Ruby, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Likeness and the Similitudes, Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Detachment, Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Eternal, Individual, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Encompassing, Most Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. Thou hast ever been the Being before all things, the Entity above all things, the Essence with all things, the Creator beneath all things, and exalted with all things. Thou hast ever given life and caused death, then caused death and given life, and verily Thou art the Living Who dieth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful! Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath elevated Himself in His loftiness above all existing things, Who hath made Himself invincible in His invincibility above all atoms, Who is powerful in His power above all beings, and mighty in His might above all who are in the kingdom of earth and heaven. I testify, and all His creation testify, that there is no God but Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that are in the heavens and earth and between them glorify Him. There is no God but Him, the Manifest One. Verily the Letters of the Seven are His servant and His Word. God hath revealed Himself unto him through His own Self, then revealed Himself through all His creation, and through him distinguished between those in the fire and the light by His decree. They who turn to God through him - these are the companions of Paradise and these are the triumphant ones. They who turn to God without him - God will not accept aught of their deeds, and these are far removed from the path of God.The Fourth in the FourthIn the Name of God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful! Praise be to God, there is no God but Him, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful.

In the name of God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Vengeful, the Most Vengeful! Verily, the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity when naught can be seen in him save the First Unity. I testify that God, glorified be He, manifesteth His vengeance through His word "Nay," beneath whose shadow the servant seeketh refuge, and His grace through His word "Yea," beneath whose shadow all servants seek His good-pleasure. Verily God, glorified be He, in His Essence, hath no direct contact with what His creation hath contact with. If thou attainest unto the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, and takest vengeance on whosoever believeth not in Him, then will thy being be a proof of those most exalted Names. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy station with God, wherein God is pleased. The Manifestations of these Names neither raise up His Cause, nor reveal His power, nor proclaim His decree. Verily God, glorified be He, is just in all His deeds. His omnipotence is pure justice and His dominion is the essence of grace, for through these two the servant is freed from all save His good-pleasure and entereth into the paradise of His obedience and His decree. Verily, God hath ever been independent of all His creation and self-sufficient above all His servants. Should He raise up a Manifestation of mercy, this is through His grace unto those who believe in Him, and should He cause to appear a Manifestation of power, this is through His mercy that He might cause to enter therein those who were not in His good-pleasure. Both of these are grace and mercy, existence and bounty. Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe.O number of Ra and Ba! We have sent down a book unto him who was not there concerning the Name of Grief, and this is its sister which We have sent down unto thee. Therefore preserve them both as thine eyes and draw not nigh unto that which grieveth thee. Copy from the Book of Grief if thou hast not copied what We have mentioned its name in the Book, and convey it unto those who think they do good, that they might perchance attain unto God's mercy on the Day of Resurrection through their return unto God their Lord and their seeking of forgiveness. And make mention of all the companions of guidance, one and all, from thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the name of God, the All-Encompassing, the All-Encompassing! There is no God but He, the All-Encompassing, the All-Encompassing! Say: God encompasseth above every possessor of encompassing power. None can escape from the dominion of His encompassing power, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Encompasser, the All-Surrounding, the Most Encompassing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, before Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them humble themselves. Say: All are devoted to Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the sovereignty \[...\]

Say: all are devoutly obedient unto Him and whatsoever lieth between them. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the Kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the realm divine, then the dominion and the world of being. He giveth life and causeth death, then strength and the ruby realm. Then He causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Nothing escapeth God's knowledge, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the All-Wise. Say: God hath indeed sent forth all the Messengers that ye should worship none but God, my Lord and your Lord, for this is the straight and certain path. Say: God hath revealed in the Books naught but the mention of truth from His presence. Speak ye naught but the truth, and be ye among those who are certain of God's signs. O Manifestation of that Name! Bear thou witness that there is no God but Me, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. I have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life that thou mightest believe in Me on the day of My manifestation and be among those who are certain of God's signs. I have indeed made Myself known on the Day of Resurrection to all who dwell in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Those who have believed in God and His signs - these are they who are the believers. And they who have turned away from the mention of thy Lord when they heard it have entered into the fire and they shall have no helpers. We have indeed sent down the Furqan aforetime that ye might be saved through what We have revealed therein. We have nurtured you through the years of planting that ye might be saved on the day of God's manifestation. We have revealed aforetime in the Furqan that none but God is able to reveal a single verse, and ye have all borne witness to this from the first of what God hath revealed unto the first of what the Bayan hath revealed from His presence, and ye are all believers in this. How is it then, when ye hear Our clear verses, ye do not testify that this is from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting? If ye believe in what God hath revealed aforetime, there is no way for you except that ye should say: He Who revealed the Furqan hath revealed the Bayan, and there is no God but God - all are worshippers of Him. And if ye say "That proof sufficeth us not," God hath aforetime revealed in the Surih of the Spider that which refuteth your words - unto what God hath revealed do ye return. Ponder ye then on what hath been revealed in the Furqan aforetime. God hath adduced no proof other than your powerlessness concerning what God hath revealed \[...\]

And if you say "Those proofs are sufficient for us, that which God sent down before in the Surah of the Spider," God refutes your words, for unto that which God hath revealed shall ye return. Reflect on that which hath been revealed in the Qur'an aforetime. God adduceth no proof other than your powerlessness concerning what He hath revealed, even though ye all say "God hath not revealed this, nor were we witnesses thereof." Consider the knowledge of those who claim "We are learned in God's religion." Were God to send down unto them a sign like unto Moses, they would all believe in that moment. Say: These signs are greater than the signs of all the Prophets combined, if ye be of them that are certain in your faith. Say: Were the verses of the Qur'an not greater, how would God abrogate through them what He had revealed aforetime unto all His Prophets? Why do ye not ponder what God hath revealed before, nor consider the Cause of God? These are proofs that were revealed before in the Qur'an, and ye all believe in them. And indeed, there is a proof to which your minds bear witness, and by which ye were wont to prove. Were anyone to desire to enter Islam, would ye adduce any proof besides the verses of the Qur'an? Were ye to mention aught else, God's Cause would not be established for him who desireth to enter - how then hath God's proof been perfected for all the worlds? And if ye say it is established, then why do ye not establish for yourselves what ye establish for him who desireth to enter your religion? Why do ye not see? Verily We sent down the Qur'an, and verily We elevated it, for We have power over all things. And We raised up the Messengers, and those who were witnesses after Him, and those who were the gates of guidance, then the Prophets, the truthful ones, and the believers. And thou, from the first moment thou didst hear God's Cause, wert veiled from God's good-pleasure, and God witnesseth naught from thee, not even if thou shouldst return unto God thy Lord and become of them that seek forgiveness. Have mercy on thine own soul, for the likeness of those who were given the Qur'an is as the likeness of those who were given the Gospel, and all are in a new creation. Observe how We have made the highest thereof the lowest, and the lowest thereof the highest, and all are veiled from God's Cause. And verily that in which thou takest pride and whereof thou wert among the learned hath returned to its primal life, and the religion of God hath triumphed, then returned unto God, the Lord of all worlds. O thou Name, all thy religion \[...\]

Return ye to the sayings of your Imams, and the sayings of your Imams return to the words of your Prophet, to that which was revealed in the Furqan. There ye find your proofs. We have taken all that was of your religion and have begun a new creation as We please through Our command 'Be!' and it is. Say: God shall not be questioned about what He doeth, but all shall be questioned about all things. The people possess not a mustard seed of that which profiteth them. When God hath raised up the supreme proof of their religion, do any of its parts remain for them? What aileth you that ye watch not over your souls nor ponder the Cause of God? Were all who are on earth to believe in your Qa'im, behold, all would become believers thereby. And should anyone be veiled from Him, then by his own self he entereth into the fire, and God is independent of all worlds.Thou hast worshipped thy Lord from the beginning of thy life until now that He might be pleased with thee and testify that thou art among the believers. But how can We testify on thy behalf when thou hast not loved the Cause of God aforetime and wast not among those endowed with certitude? Say: All thy deeds are established by Our word 'Yea', for We are the Speakers, and are nullified by Our word 'Nay', for We are the Just Ones. We desire naught for thee save bounty, and this is of God's grace unto thee, if thou art of those who perceive.This is the Day of Resurrection wherein all are brought before Us and all shall be questioned concerning what they have earned. Free thyself from God's fire, and then thy believing brethren. For verily, the likeness of My Revelation is as the Revelation of Muhammad, the Apostle of God. Dost thou hear any mention of the monks of those days? They were seized and entered into the fire wherein they find no help. Thus doth God testify concerning those who entered not into the true religion and who in the days of God were among the God-fearing. This is of God's grace and mercy unto thee if thou art of those who perceive.Thou shalt recite this Book unto whomsoever desireth to be guided unto God, thy Lord, by a way, for this is a mercy unto the worlds. If the sun of heaven is reflected in all mirrors, then all would derive proof therefrom. But if no mirror faceth it of itself until it setteth - this is the Cause of God if ye would remember. Say: On the Day of Resurrection all shall be tested save the guides of thy Lord, for they shall abide under the shadow of creation. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, all shall be tested in the day of His manifestation save Him and the guides of His Own Self.Say: Ye call upon none besides God and His names. Were the veil to be removed from your insight, ye would all together, night and day, turn toward God your Lord. But ye worship God according to your own desires, therefore it profiteth you not though ye suppose ye do well. Say: Worship ye according to what hath been ordained for you in the Bayan if ye desire salvation on the Day of Resurrection.Say: Should all who are on earth gather together to produce the like of a single verse We have revealed unto thee, they would be unable and powerless, even if they were all learned ones. Say: The extent of your learned ones' knowledge is less than those who lived in the days of Moses, for when they heard the proof, they brought forth something \[...\]

Say: Even if all on earth were learned, the extent of your scholars' knowledge is lower than those who lived in the days of Moses, for when they heard the proof, they brought forth something, while you are like those who do nothing. Look at the extent of knowledge of those who were given the Furqan, where they themselves were lower than those who lived in two Dispensations before them, yet they deemed themselves learned. Nay, nay! They have not worshipped God as He deserves to be worshipped. Had they truly worshipped God, they would have turned to His proof. This is the extent of their knowledge after they have heard the verses of God, yet they testify from one who has no knowledge like that in which you take pride. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that Manifestation is more wondrous than the Manifestation of Muhammad before, but people do not understand nor remember. What God revealed to Muhammad over twenty-three years, if God had wished, He could have revealed to him in two days and two nights. Say: If you desire, We shall surely reveal to you, for We are powerful over that. If it is not detailed in two days and two nights and written before Us by one who tires not, this is from God's command, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Is there any proof equal to this, if you would but remember? God manifested Muhammad among the Arabs, while I was raised among those who cannot speak Arabic words, so how do they utter verses? God sent him forth after forty years of his life had passed, as you all remember. But God sent me forth after twenty-four years of my life had passed, and I completed My proof upon all who are on earth through the Book which We revealed in truth, but you are far removed from God's command. We have revealed a thousand verses in six hours, while you are all together unable to comprehend them, let alone utter the like of this. Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! God has not given such grace except to the successors of Muhammad before. If you are claimants, then bring me a single prayer that you would sincerely offer to God, your Lord. You cannot, nor are you able. This is from God's grace, which He specifies for whomsoever He wishes among His servants. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Look at what We have revealed regarding the jewels of knowledge, the essence of wisdom, the camphor of utterance, and the pure command, that you may be among those who comprehend God's command. Say: All these are guides in the paths of limitations, that you may return to God, your Lord. If you traverse the ocean of names, there is no God but God, neither before nor after, and all are His servants, and all worship Him. Was there anything before God by which I might make Him known to you? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! Say: He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: God is the Creator of all things, glory be to Him!

Say: God is the Creator of all things. Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe. Indeed, the First is His name, and the Last is His name, and the Manifest is His name, and the Hidden is His name, and all point to Him, that there is no God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. And He has four stations. The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Wrathful, the Most Wrathful. There is no God but Him, the Most Wrathful, the Most Wrathful. Say: God is more wrathful than any possessor of wrath. None can escape from the dominion of His wrath, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been wrathful and vengeful. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and earth and between them make glorification. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Nature, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth and between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God hath created you and provided for you and caused you to die and brought you to life. Is there any god besides God who can do aught of this? Say: Glorified be God above what they mention. And God is not powerless over anything in the heavens or on earth or between them. And God is the All-Powerful, the Most High, the Great. He aideth whom He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: O people of the Book! All of you enter into the religion of God through the remembrance of God. Do ye not observe those who are in the religion of Islam, how they all together, by night and by day, make mention of God and recite what was revealed in the Qur'an? Say: Verily they make mention of God to make mention of the Point of the Bayan, and verily they recite the Qur'an to recite what God hath revealed in the Bayan. Let not this veil you from the path of God, for on the Day of Truth you shall likewise be tested. Perchance ye judge in the name of Him Whom God shall make manifest while ye perceive not. All of you on the day of His manifestation call upon Him by the names of God and are devout and faithful to what God hath revealed in the Bayan. Then when He Whom God shall make manifest maketh Himself known unto you, ye turn unto those who have believed in Him. Say: Those whose hearts are dawning-places of the names of God, who by night \[...\]

They are submissive and God-fearing according to what God hath revealed in the Bayan. When God maketh Him Whom God shall make manifest known unto you, then will ye find yourselves before those who have believed in Him and are turned towards Him. Say: Their hearts are the dawning-places of the names of God, unto which ye turn day and night. And ye recite what God revealeth unto Him from His tongue, for this is greater than what ye recite from the Bayan, could ye but perceive it. Ye worship God not according to what He loveth but according to what ye love. Say: We verily love that all things should worship God in truth, and all do love this. Then no sorrow remaineth with God or with you, for He is your Desired One and God's Desired One, your Goal and your Lord's Goal, and all follow this path. Yea, God will renew for all of you what ye love to worship according to what hath been manifested before, and God loveth that ye should worship Him according to what shall be manifested hereafter. All peoples are like unto you if the veil be lifted from before their hearts' faces. Then all would worship according to what God hath revealed in the Bayan, for all desire to worship in truth, and were they to know their worship leadeth to other than God, they would not entertain it in their minds. And were they to know this, it would be because they think they do good, but God beareth witness that they do not good, and those endowed with knowledge bear witness as God hath borne witness. Otherwise, were the veil to be lifted from all things, the purpose of all would be to worship God and to walk in His good-pleasure. This is what God hath ordained in the Book, therefore what God hath ordained is your desire and what ye seek. This is what He hath willed in the Book. But ye worship according to past revelations in a way that profiteth you not and harmeth you. God, however, loveth that ye worship Him in what will profit you and admit you into paradise. This is of God's grace unto all worlds. All that hath occurred from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end - all think within themselves they act for God, but in every Revelation God beareth witness concerning those who act for God by those who have followed the Sun of Truth from His presence, while those who follow Him not remain in past revelations. Say: This is proof that they acted not for God, for had they acted for God they would not have turned aside in every Revelation from God's command from the Sun of Truth. All are of God and all are by God and all are from God and all are unto God, and all desire to dwell in the love of God. Say: God's purpose is your purpose and God's desire is your desire, but ye seek Him through what God loved before rather than what He loveth for you hereafter. Thereby your proof before God your Lord becometh manifest. Fear ye God, then fear ye Him. For all, with the utmost of what they possess, desire to worship God their Lord and to walk in His good-pleasure.

Say: All shall serve God according to their highest capacity, and walk in His good-pleasure. Yet when they fail to recognize God their Lord in the succeeding Revelation, they remain veiled from Him, though they imagine themselves to be abiding in His good-pleasure. Say: Glory be to God! In every Revelation He reneweth the creation of all things by the command of God through the Primal Point, for which you wait expectantly. This is the Day when the fruits of the first creation appear in your return, and the first blossoms of the gardens of the latter creation in your beginning. These two mighty bounties shall you attain on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Let your religion be like unto your own selves - when your life draws to its close, how you desire to yield it up. Similarly, when your religion has reached its ordained term, let it be lifted up to God its Lord and be created anew in the latter creation. Blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds! Say: When crystal has passed its days, its luster fades. Should God desire to restore its brilliance, He creates it anew by casting it into fire as water, then fashioning it by the hands of craftsmen - and excellent is such craftsmanship. Thus do you witness the measures of your transformation and final abode. Fear God in the fire of His Manifestation, for if you remain patient, you shall be created anew. This is of God's bounty unto you, would that you might remember. Say: God knows what has been decreed for the Bayan, and none comprehends its knowledge save those endowed with the knowledge of the Letters, who truly understand. They have not been given all knowledge; they grasp My remembrance while remaining veiled from every matter. The term of the Qur'an was the number of "gharis", then after the Bayan was revealed the number of "ha'", but before this in the Books of David, Moses and Jesus, each had the number of "tin". He ordains what He wishes and decrees what He wills. Say: What God revealed in the Psalms and what was revealed thereafter was all that you might serve God according to what was revealed in the Bayan. But those given those Books remained veiled from what was revealed therein. Yet God shall be patient with you until the name of "Mustaghath" is completed in the Bayan. Strive to attain the highest possible station. Should God manifest His Cause before that time, we are all believers in Him and are all certain of Him. We shall look to the proof of our religion, and when we witness such verses revealed by God through the tongue of one possessed of knowledge and wisdom, we testify there is no God but Him. This is what God promised us before in the Bayan, and we all believe in it. It never occurred to us this would appear from other than God, as we have witnessed our own powerlessness \[...\]

God promised us aforetime in the Bayan that we all believe in it. Never did we imagine that this would appear from any source but God, for we have witnessed our own powerlessness and the powerlessness of all on earth, and we have believed in our Lord, the All-Merciful, through what He revealed therein, for we are all powerless before it. We would never think to ask Him for verses other than these, as these are greater than all verses in our possession in a mighty Book. Were it not greater, how would God have abrogated what was revealed before and established this in truth? We all believe in this. We would never consider that this would not suffice us, for this is what our Lord, the All-Merciful, has forbidden us in the Bayan and before that in the Furqan. We have found sufficiency in God and His verses, and we all believe in Him. We shall not adduce any proof of His Manifestation other than the verses of God, for in the Furqan He adduced no proof but this, and in the Bayan, after the supreme conditions, God adduced no proof but these verses. Therefore we are all certain of this, shall adduce these proofs, and shall remain silent regarding aught else. These are four proofs that have been established, made firm, ordained and magnified from God, the Exalted, the Great. And thus through clear evidence our minds and our proof have been made complete before all the worlds.

Verily should all who are on earth desire to enter into the Bayan, with Us are naught but those verses, and their powerlessness before them. And all rely upon them to prove others, so how should we not rely upon them in the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, to prove it to ourselves, after God hath commanded us to follow Him in truth? Glory be to God that ye should be among the veiled ones! This is the utterance of those who follow Him Whom God shall make manifest, and these are they who, through these supreme proofs, shall in truth prevail over all who dwell on earth. And how can those who follow not Him Whom God shall make manifest through these supreme proofs claim to have followed God in the Bayan, and before that in the Furqan, when God hath proved in them both through none other than His clear verses, before which all creation standeth powerless, being unable to produce the like thereof? And verily the creation of verses is greater than these - such are the proofs of truth if ye would understand. Say: The verses of the Furqan are they who believed in Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and who on the Day of Truth believe in the Bayan. And the verses of the Bayan are the servants who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and are assured of what God hath revealed unto Him. Thus do ye comprehend in every Manifestation of God's Cause, and ye shall witness that the creation of the later Manifestation is greater than that of the former. Thus do ye witness all things. Say: What God revealeth in the first creation is for what He revealeth in the latter creation - ye all give thanks for everything in its measure. When ye were but a drop of seed, yet walked in human form upon the earth - likewise are ye in the degrees of your religion. Had ye not given thanks to God, your Lord, in the day of the seed-drop, how could ye attain unto the heights which God hath ordained for you? And we all give thanks unto God from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and we all worship our Lord, the All-Merciful. Say: Worship not except when ye are assured of God's verses, and accept the truth from God, being in every Manifestation assured of what is revealed from God. And unto God belong all the most beautiful names, both before and after. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great. And verily your God is the God of gods, there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Most High. Recite ye then these verses, for they are the essence of what God hath revealed in the Bayan. All end in God's command, their Lord, and all begin from God their Lord. And it hath four stages, the first being in the first: In the Name of God, the All-Inspiring, the All-Inspiring. Say: God is the Supreme Inspirer above every possessor of inspiration. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His inspiring power, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath been All-Inspiring, Inspiring, Most Inspiring. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in prostration. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God inspireth you with the paths of guidance. He is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Yet ye follow not that which God inspireth you through the guides of His Cause. Perchance ye are veiled from the Will of God. Say: When God sent down the Furqan (Quran), this was what God inspired all His servants with, but those endowed with knowledge believed in what God revealed therein, while those not endowed with knowledge despaired of what God inspired them with and entered the fire wherein they shall not be helped.Say: God verily inspireth every soul with its negation and affirmation, its fire and light, its good and evil, and what is ordained for it in its return and abode. Yet some follow the paths of truth while others, after recognizing the truth, become veiled from it. Say: He verily inspireth you with God's Cause within yourselves, that all your religion is from God through what was revealed in the Furqan to Muhammad. Then ye return to speaking within yourselves about the Bayan: "Just as we believed in the Furqan, how can we be patient and not believe?" after God hath inspired you that none but God can produce a verse. How then do ye hear yet believe not? And God hath inspired you that these verses are greater than the verses of the Prophets, for were they not greater, God would not have abrogated through them what was revealed to them. Yet ye remain veiled from what He truthfully inspireth you with. Then God inspireth you within yourselves that these verses suffice you just as what ye read in the Sura of the Spider, wherein ye attain certitude. Then God inspireth you with what was used as proof in the Furqan of your powerlessness - how they witness their own powerlessness yet distance themselves from God's Cause. Then God inspireth you with proofs from your own minds which ye all comprehend. Were anyone to desire to enter your religion, ye are able to present proofs without verses and to manifest to whoever wishes to enter your religion by saying otherwise, for then no word from you would be heard by those who wish to enter your religion except \[...\]

Say: All, from the first that hath no beginning unto the last that hath no end, prostrate themselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest. How is it that ye prostrate yourselves day and night according to what the Point of the Bayan hath commanded you, yet when He Whom God shall make manifest appeareth, ye prostrate not before Him? O all things! Perform such deeds as shall profit you, lest ye enter into the Fire. Though ye prostrate yourselves before God from the beginning of your lives unto their end, this shall not benefit you on the Day of Resurrection unless ye prostrate yourselves but once before Him Whom God shall make manifest, for this single prostration would be better for you than all the prostrations ye have performed from the beginning of your lives unto their end. For this would be your salvation, while those would lead you to the Fire. Waste not your deeds, and strive for that which shall bring you deliverance. Reflect upon the peoples who came before you, for ye shall be like unto them on the Day of Resurrection if ye fail to recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest. God shall make you like unto those peoples who receive no help on the Day of Resurrection and attain not unto salvation.Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth the splendor of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all prostrate themselves before Him. Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth the glory of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all remember Him. Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth the beauty of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all bow down before Him. Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth the majesty of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all are humble before Him. Verily, He Whom God shall make manifest is the light of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all stand before Him. Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth the mercy of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and all are submissive before Him. Verily, unto Him Whom God shall make manifest belongeth all that hath been created and shall be created of all things, and all are possessed through His command. Verily, whatsoever reacheth unto Him reacheth unto God - will ye not fear? And whatsoever reacheth not unto Him reacheth not unto God - will ye not be apprehensive?Have mercy upon yourselves by not wasting your nights in the day of your veiling from Him Whom God shall make manifest. For if ye knew the truth from His presence, ye would believe. But in your veiling ye have no proof in the Book. Follow what God inspireth in you through His ambassadors and within your own selves, that perchance ye may attain salvation on the Day of God's Manifestation. God is independent of you and of all things, while ye are in need of God, worshipping Him night and day, and ye are His servants \[...\]

Glory be to Thee, O my God! I testify before Thee, and before all things, that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee. Thou art One, without peer. Thine is the Kingdom and the dominion, then the might and grandeur, then the power and divinity, then the strength and sovereignty, then the realm and humanity, then honor and majesty, then beauty and comeliness, then glory and perfection, then strength and action, then likeness and similitude, then mercy and bounty, then authority and justice, then station and sublimity, then greatness and independence, then glory and exaltation, then might and abstraction, then power and elevation, then sovereignty and omnipotence, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy command and creation.Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Most Holy, Everlasting. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast ordained the creation of all things and ordained it with perfect ordination. By Thy will Thou hast formed all things and formed it with perfect formation.This is the night of independence, O my God. All things worship Thee through me while all are veiled from me. All turn to Thee through me while I am alone upon a solitary mountain, save that there is one from the First Unity before me. Glory be to Thee and exalted art Thou! How great is Thy justice toward that creation, whereby Thou hast separated me from them by Thy power, for Thou didst create each for meeting Thee in the countenance of Thy proof. When Thou didst prevent each from the fruit of their existence, this was Thy justice concerning them.Glory be to Thee and exalted art Thou! Bestow upon them through Thy grace and open unto them the gates of Thy bounty and show them the meeting with Thy face, for Thy mercy hath encompassed all atoms and Thy gift hath surrounded all beings. Therefore, O God, send down Thy mercy upon the Tree of the Bayan, its root, branch, twigs, leaves, fruits, and all that is in it and upon it. Make all of these an impregnable tablet of paper and present it before Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, that He may accept the return of all who are in the Bayan through His grace and begin the creation of the other through His generosity, for all are poor before Thy bounty and slaves before Thy generosity.Therefore, by Thy generosity, O my God, and Thy bounty, and by Thy munificence, O my Lord, and Thy grace, and by Thy benevolence, O my Beloved, and Thy favor, preserve Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection for all Thy party, that no sorrow may touch Him, and show Him every good that Thou hast encompassed in knowledge from all Thy creation. For Thou hast indeed encompassed all things in knowledge and Thy mercy hath embraced all things. Thou art independent of all Thy creation and self-sufficient from all Thy servants. All return unto Thy bounty and all begin from the gate of Thy generosity. There is no might nor power except through Thee. I began from Thee, O my God\[...\]

All power is from Thee alone. I began from Thee, O my God, and unto Thee shall I return. Verily all command is in Thy hands. Glorified art Thou! There is none other God but Thee, the King of kings, the Minister of ministers, the Judge of judges, the Teacher of teachers, and the Most Bountiful of the bountiful ones. When Thou didst rear me in the station of bounty, then didst Thou manifest me in the degrees of glory through those proofs in the Gate. Therefore, by the right of those proofs with Thee, O my God, make all these prostrate themselves before Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, submissive before Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, humble before Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, mindful of Him Whom Thou shalt cause to rule, and thankful to Him Whom Thou shalt cause to possess us. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Divine, the Most Divine. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath elevated Himself in His elevation above all created things, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existing things, Who hath made Himself victorious in His victory above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath manifested Himself in His manifestation above all beings. He calleth Himself and all His creation to witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. He hath chosen an impregnable essence from the summit of wealth, then hath He strengthened it with four kinds of sincere learned ones, living judges, submissive angels, and humble sovereigns. Then was established the number of the letter Ha in the Gate through those five kinds. Upon one line thereof is written the name of the Sovereign, upon another line the name of the Minister, upon another line the name of the Judge, upon another line the name of the Teacher, and upon the highest line the name of the Wealthy One. Even thus hath God manifested His Gate through His most excellent names unto all who dwell in the kingdom of His heaven and earth, and hath chosen for it primary names, then caused them to enter into the sea of eternal infinity. Thus all through these stand by the command of God from His presence.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Divine, the Most Divine. Praise be to God, there is none other God but Him, the Most Divine, the Most Divine. Verily the glory from God is upon the First Unity and upon whosoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. And after me, I testify that the Divine inspiration of God shall never be cut off from any soul, whether it be through universal creation or through personal revelation, and the latter appeareth through the former. And verily in that Dispensation God hath manifested the Tree of Truth from the lineage of merchants, then hath He manifested His Cause through the learned ones and the judges and above them. Therefore if thou desirest God to deliver thee on the Day of Resurrection in the Gate, make thy remembrance on the Day of Resurrection a remembrance in the Gate, and make thy remembrance five remembrances: First "O Wealthy One," then "O Teacher," then "O Judge," then "O Minister," then "O Sovereign." For verily whoso entereth the Gate, God shall cause him to become victorious over all things through the proof of his Lord, even as thou seest in that Day one of the dwellers of that Glory, the dawning-places of those proofs, conquering all things through the signs of God. This then is the victory of truth through truth, and the divine inspirations from the Lord unto the servant. Therefore hold fast to the five-fold form, the human temple whose outward form is Ha.

In the Name of God, the Most Renowned, the Most Renowned! No God is there but Him, the Most Renowned, the Most Renowned! Say: God is more renowned than any possessor of renown. None can escape from the dominion of His sovereign renown, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, the All-Acquainted.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Glory, then the Sovereignty and the Material Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belong the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belong whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God is known by all things, and nothing is known except through God, and all are His worshippers. Say: God is beloved by all things, and nothing is loved except through God, and all bow down before Him. Say: God is the Goal of all things, and nothing is sought except through God, and all act for His sake.Say: The knowledge of all things is through God, inasmuch as He hath revealed Himself unto them. Will ye not see? All know God, their Lord, the Most Merciful, and all are devoted to Him. Say: All peoples know God through what their Prophet hath manifested unto them from God, and they know naught else save \[...\]

All save God know naught. During every Revelation, when God wisheth to raise up what hath been revealed before, He judgeth you as those who know not the Truth, for what ye know appeareth in one Manifestation and is revealed in another Manifestation. Will ye not reflect? From the beginning that hath no beginning, what ye know is Him Whom God shall make manifest, unto the end that hath no end - ye know naught save God. Verily, the thrones of His Revelation in every Dispensation are called by the names of all peoples, who call upon their Prophet. God is well-pleased with all the thrones of His Revelation, both past and future, and He is well-pleased with those who, in the next Revelation, enter therein. Were the veil to be lifted from your eyes, ye would know none save Him Whom God shall make manifest, yet on the day of His appearance, ye may not recognize Him even after He maketh Himself known unto you. O all things! After God maketh Himself known unto you through Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye shall know Him. For this is all that God hath commanded you in your religion, did ye but know. Your deeds shall be accepted, else God will judge you worthy of the fire, even though ye may have ascended to the highest degrees of piety. For God hath created all things solely to worship Him, but how can any thing worship Him before knowing Him? When He Whom God shall make manifest distinguisheth Himself for you, ye follow Him, for this is your worship of God, your Lord, if ye wish to bear witness. Say: That which ye have read in the Qur'an - "None shall enter Paradise unless the camel passeth through the eye of the needle" - consider what God intended thereby. The eye of the needle is the Primal Point when all His servants recognize Him. When it hath grown great and become magnified before God through that which ye mention, and this in one Manifestation, then in another it must needs enter into the eye of the needle despite its loftiness and magnitude. Thus doth God teach you concerning the Primal Point, that ye may judge yourselves by the truth. Behold how Islam appeared through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and how it grew great through all who magnified Islam. All of this must needs enter the eye of the needle if ye desire to enter Paradise and are assured thereof. For all such greatness must needs prostrate itself before the Primal Point. This is what God intended, not what ye imagine of your own accord. Likewise on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the Primal Point will have grown great through all that is in the Bayan. All such greatness shall ye manifest before Him Whom God shall make manifest through your humility, then prostrate yourselves before God. If ye do this, ye shall enter Paradise. This is what God intended by the camel entering the eye of the needle. If on the day of God's Manifestation ye see God as one Being and behold all who are in the Bayan in their great exaltation, then make the greatness of creation small before God, that ye may be able to prostrate yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Should He appear great unto you, then consider how in the Revelation of Muhammad, peace be upon Him, God abrogated all the Books \[...\]

And you shall behold all who are in the Bayan in the loftiness of His grandeur. Let the greatness of creation become small in your eyes before God, that ye may be enabled to prostrate yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Should He appear unto you, then behold how in the Revelation of Muhammad (peace be upon Him) God hath exalted all books and peoples, then through Him created whatsoever He willed of another creation. Will ye not fear God? And if ye know not, then behold how in the Point of the Bayan God hath exalted all that was revealed aforetime, and through Him hath established whatsoever He desired in another creation. Blessed be God, the Great Lord, Who hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Bountiful.Say: Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and sovereignty! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and grandeur! Glorified be God, the Lord of power and divinity! Glorified be God, the Lord of strength and ruby splendor! Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and the human realm! Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and majesty! Glorified be God, the Lord of countenance and beauty! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and action! Glorified be God, the Lord of mercy and grace! Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and justice! Glorified be God, the Lord of similitude and parables! Glorified be God, the Lord of stations and sublimity! Glorified be God, the Lord of grandeur and majesty! Glorified be God, the Lord of supremacy and independence! Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and inaccessibility! Glorified be God, the Lord of joy and gladness! Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and power!In the name of God, the Most Renowned, the Most Renowned! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and sovereignty, Thine the might and grandeur, Thine the power and divinity, Thine the strength and ruby splendor, Thine the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the face and perfection, Thine the might and action, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the stations and sublimity, Thine the grandeur and independence, Thine the glory and inaccessibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy command and creation. All are Thy servants and prostrate before Thee, submissive and humble before Thee, remembering and praising Thee, thanking and glorifying Thee, and exalting Thy sovereignty. How exalted is Thy renown, whereby all things know Thee in their inmost hearts and outward beings, and call upon Thee! Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast revealed Thyself to all things through all things, so that nothing remains ignorant of Thee. Thou hast made Thyself known to Thyself through Thyself to all things, and thus all things have known Thee. Thou art the Renowned in the highest heavens, Thou art the Renowned in the lowest earth, and Thou art the Renowned in all that lieth between them and in the hereafter.

Thou art the One known between them, in the hereafter and in the first life. Glorified art Thou, O my God! All are from Thee, belong to Thee, exist through Thee, and return unto Thee. There is none other God but Thee. How gracious art Thou in Thy creation, making known to them Thine eternal Self after having created them from primordial clay. By Thy might! I have found none known, neither before nor after, none beloved, neither in heaven nor on earth, none described, neither in the kingdom of command nor of creation, none sought after, neither in the heights nor in the depths, and none worshipped besides Thee, neither in the highest kingdom nor in the lowest particle. Verily, on this Friday, the Day of Independence, all things shall surely know Thee, all things shall surely prostrate before Thee, all things shall surely glorify Thee, and all things shall surely praise Thee, when none existed beside me with Thee, for all had known Thee through Thy previous Manifestations, that they might worship Thee, worship Thee, while all are veiled from the appearance of Thy wondrous creation. I worship Thee through what Thou hast revealed to me of myself in the manifestation of Thy creation, for this is Thy good-pleasure in every Manifestation Thou dost reveal and every Dayspring Thou dost cause to shine. O God! Do Thou send down upon the Tree of the Bayan, its root, branch, twigs, leaves, and fruits that which befitteth the loftiness of Thy sanctity, the sublimity of Thy glory, the elevation of Thy generosity, the inaccessibility of Thy bounty, and the transcendence of Thy grace. Make all things created in the Bayan, then cause all these to be present before Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest as a bonded servant possessing naught save what his Lord hath bestowed upon him, that they may thereby comprehend Thy favor in the manifestation of Thine hereafter. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling, the Sovereign, the Judge. All know Thee through Thy Manifestation, while in Thine essence Thou art unknowable. All describe Thee through Thy signs, while in Thy hiddenness Thou art indescribable. Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. I am of those who know Thee.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Known, the Most Known! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His elevation above all contingent beings, risen in His ascension above all existing things, manifested in His revelation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and shown His power above all created things. I testify, and all His creation doth testify, that there is no God but He, the One, the All-Knowing. All who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them know Him, and all who are in the kingdoms of Command and Creation and what lieth beneath them glorify Him, that there is no God but He, the One, the All-Describing. Then I testify, and all His creation doth testify, that He, glorified be His praise, hath chosen for the repository of His knowledge, the throne of His description, the seat of His love, the loftiness of His worship, and the inaccessibility of His purpose, a sublime Essence, a radiant Camphor, an exalted Essence, an eternal Being, and a holy Pattern. Then He revealed unto it through itself, and cast into its reality the image of itself. Thus were His signs and deeds manifested through it, and His revelations shone forth through what He had cast into it of His manifestations. He made it stand upon the station of His knowledge throughout all the kingdoms of His Command \[...\]

And His manifestations shone forth from it through what was cast therein of His manifestations, thus establishing it upon the station of His recognition throughout all the kingdoms of His command and creation. Then there remained naught in existence but it had recognized the Seven Letters as the Gate of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. His verses were revealed unto him, and He chose for him from among the primary letters the most exalted ones. Then through these He created whatsoever He desired of infinite essential numbers. Thus were the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, both before and after. There is none other God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Known.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Known, the Most Known. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Known, the Most Known. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity.I testify that none is known save God, exalted be His glory, and none is described save Him, mighty be His might, and none is loved save Him, extended be His extension, and none is sought save Him in His exaltation, and none is worshipped save Him in His most impregnable Book. Verily He, glorified and praised be He, in His Essence cannot be known, nor described, nor named, nor loved, nor sought. And inasmuch as He hath created all things for His recognition, every thing hath recognized itself in every manifestation through the very Throne of His manifestation. Thus the Throne of His manifestation is that which addresseth thee in the Bayan, through which God hath desired to be known in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and through which He hath desired to be described in the kingdoms of loftiness and inaccessibility, and through which He hath desired to be loved in the summit of glory and inaccessibility, and through which He hath desired to be worshipped in the kingdom of transcendence and the apex of nearness, and through which He hath desired to be sought in all whereupon the name of a thing falleth, in glory and majesty.Therefore on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, this is the Throne of His recognition, wherein He hath joined His remembrance to the remembrance of His own Self. No thing shall say "There is none other God but Him" unless it recognizeth him whom He hath commanded thus, and mentioneth the Letters of the Trinity before the Quaternary, then the Manifestations of His Command as ordained through creation. Thus doth God cause all His creation to recognize him who recognizeth none but Him. How many are those who are known in thy days, yet when God mentioneth them not, none thereafter remembereth them. And how many are the servants whom none knoweth, yet when God mentioneth them, all things know them.If thou desirest thy heart to be among the manifestations of the name of "the Known," then be thou among those known by Him Whom God shall make manifest; that is, be thou among the manifestations of His attribute of being known, the most known thereof, that thou mayest make thine essence mirrors of that Name, and the attribute of being known may be manifested unto thee, whereby all things shall know thee and all things shall mention thee. This is of God's bounty, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting, and this is of God's generosity, the Mighty, the Beloved.

In the Name of God, the Most Excellent, the Most Excellent! There is no God but Him, the Most Excellent, the Most Excellent! Say: God is more excellent than every possessor of excellence. None can withhold from the sovereignty of His attributes, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Describing, the Most Excellent, the Most Praiseworthy.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, before Whom all in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them sing His glory. Say: All are His worshippers.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Might and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: All that ye describe is God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, then through His remembrance do ye make mention. This is how God hath described Himself, for were God not to describe Himself and reveal it in the Book, ye would not be able to describe Him. Say: All your descriptions return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Ye have described God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, else ye would be veiled from God's command and His description.All that ye ascend unto in describing God is the description of that which ye cannot comprehend. How could ye, when God hath described Himself? Say: Glorified and exalted is God above what those who describe Him ascribe unto Him. Say: The description of Him Whom God shall make manifest is the same whether ye utter it with your tongues or manifest it through your limbs. If on the Day of Resurrection ye address Him Whom God shall make manifest as ye would address your sovereign, ye shall all be saved and prosper. And if ye treat Him as ye treat others, ye shall all be saved.Consider how one of you is content with how God dealeth with His servants through what He hath created by His command. How then do ye not show love and are not content with God, your Lord, as a servant whom He hath created? Therefore show love for God, then acquire every description in the Book of Him Whom God shall make manifest, even though God hath described Him as "There is no God but I, the Single, the Sovereign." But ye acquire what ye describe of God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, then do ye describe.

Ye describe your Lord, the All-Merciful, according to what ye acquire and describe, but We have forbidden that any should write unto Him save upon delicate tablets like the scriptures of the Gospel, in the most excellent calligraphy with gold ink, if ye are able. Beyond this your glory before your Lord is not possible, and We command you, O all things, to describe Him Whom God shall make manifest according to your capacity, then return unto Him in truth. Say: The tablets that are attributed to the Gospel are those verses which were revealed; those who were given the Furqan took them and adorned them, then those who were given the Bayan wrote upon them. This is the fruit of the Gospel and the Furqan which We have presented unto God, their Lord, in the Bayan, as on the day God created them when naught was recorded upon them. Say: All describe Him Whom God shall make manifest in their beginning and their end, their outward and their inward aspects, whence they know not and recognize not. Were they to recognize their Described One, they would not be veiled from Him. O all things! Be not veiled from your Described One. All upon the earth at that time describe Me as they describe God their Lord - and this is My seat upon the mountain - were they to recognize their Described One, how would they pursue such a course? Say: All that ye describe God with is the description of the Point, though ye comprehend not the description of God. Consider ye on the day of His manifestation - that Primary Theophany - how all upon the earth describe Him as they describe God their Lord, the All-Merciful, and all worship Him. One who hath described God from the beginning of his life and said "Glory be to Him above what they describe" - perchance if he should behold Him, he would not magnify God in His presence, after having described Him with that whereby he glorified God from the beginning of his life until the time he beheld Him. Be ye assured that ye shall be tested regarding what ye describe, for on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye shall be tried as on the day of Muhammad and the Point of the Bayan. Him Whom ye describe from the beginning of your lives and glorify God through - perchance ye will judge Him for the glory of your religion while ye perceive not, even as they judged Muhammad aforetime and the Primal Point thereafter, after all had described Them with whatsoever praise of God they possessed and description wherewith God described Himself. Were ye to recognize your Described One, ye would not pursue such a course. Say: Your Described One is the Omnipotent, the Transcendent, Lord of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them, the One, the All-Glorious. Say: Your Described One is God Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life. If ye refer your description to Him Whom God shall make manifest, then do ye describe God your Lord; otherwise your selves and your description are rendered void and ye possess naught, dwelling in the night of darkness and veils. Then on the Day of Resurrection at the Dawning-Place of Manifestation, ascend before the presence of the Most High according to your capacity. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Bless Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and His guides in the Kingdom.

And ye abide in the night, nay, in the night of the veils of the unseen, then on the Day of Resurrection at the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation before Him, at such heights as ye are able to ascend and describe. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in the kingdom of earth and heaven. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in might and power. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in strength and divinity. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon the proofs of His Cause in force and sovereignty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon the proofs of His Cause in dominion and the human realm. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon the proofs of His Cause in glory and majesty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in sovereignty and dominion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in authority and sovereignty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in countenance and beauty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in might and action. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in mercy and grace. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in authority and justice. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in similitude and parables. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in stations and glory. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in grandeur and independence. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon His proofs in pride and majesty. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in might and invincibility. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in truth, and upon His proofs in sovereignty and power. Glory be unto Thee, O God! O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection through all Thy most excellent names, through all Thy most exalted attributes, for verily Thou art the Lord of the Hereafter and of ancient times.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Descriptive, the Most Descriptive. And verily from the glory of God upon you His most glorious, and from the majesty of God upon you His most majestic, then from the beauty of God upon you His most beautiful, then from the grandeur of God upon you His most grand, then from the light of God upon you His most luminous, then from the mercy of God upon you His most extensive, then from the words of God upon you His most perfect, then from the names of God upon you His most great, then from the might of God upon you His most mighty, then from the Will upon you His most conclusive, then from the knowledge of God upon you His most penetrating, then from the power of God upon you His most powerful, then from the utterance of God upon you His most pleasing, then from the questions upon you their most beloved, then from the nobility of God upon you His most noble, then from the sovereignty of God upon you His most enduring, then from the dominion of God upon you His most glorious, then from the bounty of God upon you His most ancient. Ye have worshipped God openly upon the earth \[...\]

Verily, upon you be the most glorious of God's glory, and upon you the most beauteous of God's beauty, and upon you the most magnificent of God's grandeur, and upon you the most luminous of God's light, and upon you the most expansive of God's mercy, and upon you the most perfect of God's words, and upon you the greatest of God's names, and upon you the most mighty of God's might, and upon you the most decisive of His will, and upon you the most penetrating of God's knowledge, and upon you the most powerful of God's power, and upon you the most pleasing of God's utterance, and upon you the most beloved of questions, and upon you the most noble of God's nobility, and upon you the most enduring of God's sovereignty, and upon you the most excellent of God's dominion, and upon you the most ancient of God's favors.Ye have worshipped God openly upon the earth and have openly rejected negation upon the earth. How lofty is your station in the Bayan and how exalted your rank therein! Ye are the first and the last, the outward and the inward. Through you hath God manifested the wonders of His ways in the Bayan and elevated that which was revealed aforetime in the Exposition. Ye loved God at the first dawning of His Manifestation before the hearers, and ye turned unto God before the rising of His light before the knowers.Ye have freed yourselves from worldly sorrows and have caused your beings to reach the summit of your hereafter. Your blessings are prepared before you, your celestial maidens are adorned at your right hand, your knowledge is purified at your left, your books are inscribed before you, and whatsoever ye love is present before your eyes. For you in Paradise is whatsoever ye love, for you in Paradise is whatsoever ye desire.God hath ever blessed, and will continue to bless, your first and your last, and all between them of your outward and your inward, and all besides them. God shall raise up one who will exalt your remembrance and elevate your Cause, and bring to naught whosoever ariseth not in your service and seeketh to wax proud against you. Verily, nothing can frustrate Him, whether in the heavens or on the earth or all that lieth between them, and He hath ever been the Avenger, the Wrathful, the All-Compelling.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the Most Descriptive, the Most Descriptive. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, and made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all created things, and manifested Himself in His manifestation above all atoms, and shown His dominion in His sovereignty over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Luminous. He hath chosen hidden essences as dawning-places of His light and rising-points of His manifestation, and hath caused them to attain their ultimate aim in their faces turned toward God their Lord, and in their approach unto God their Creator, and hath honored and ennobled them through the First Unity, and made them to be among the inheritors. This is of God's bounty unto His loved ones; verily He is the Protector of the God-fearing.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Descriptive, the Most Descriptive. Praise be to God, there is no God but He, the Most Descriptive, the Most Descriptive. And verily the splendor from God be upon the First Unity and upon whosoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity.

And whosoever resembles that One wherein naught can be seen but the Primal One; and furthermore, bear thou witness that every attribute God hath ascribed unto Him Whom God shall make manifest - exalted be His mention - is true, and that thou, on the Day of His manifestation, may perchance deny Him the name of faith after having praised God through Him, both night and day.

Thou shalt assuredly describe Him with the loftiness of glory and exaltation, and the sublimity of holiness and inaccessibility. And if thou art in doubt concerning this, then call to mind the Point of the Bayan, for all who dwell on earth in the day of His manifestation described Him as they describe God, their Lord. Consider how that which was decreed concerning Him was decreed by the dwellers of the Furqan who had ascended to the summit of piety and caution to a degree beyond which they could not conceive. And thou likewise shalt be tested on the Day of God's Manifestation. If thou dost not describe Him Whom thou hast worshipped from beginning to end with thy description of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then never approach censure of Him, for God hath aforetime revealed: Exalted is God far above that which the wrongdoers assert with great haughtiness. And what wrong could be greater than to censure Him Whom He hath described and made the Manifestation of His Self, and Whom all describe with the most exalted terms wherewith they describe God, their Lord? And thou, from the beginning of thy life unto its end, hast described Him with the most exalted terms thou couldst express. Therefore watch over thyself, for on the Day of His Manifestation thou shalt withhold from Him the name of faith after having described Him from the beginning of thy life unto its end with the utmost sanctity and majesty. Watch over thyself lest thou be numbered among the veiled ones.And He hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Praiseworthy, the Most Praiseworthy. Say: God is more praiseworthy than any possessor of praise. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign praise. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Praiser, the Praised, the All-Praising. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. Say: All before Him are prostrate. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all in the heavens and on earth and between them. Say: All are His worshippers. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby Essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: God causeth you to die, then giveth you life, and all are submissive unto Him \[...\] with God. Say: Glory be to God and exalted is He above what they attribute. Height with God. Say: Glory be to God.

Say: Glorified be God, and exalted is He above what they ascribe to His divinity! Say: Glorified be God, and exalted is He above what they mention of His divinity! Say: Glorified be God, and exalted is He above what they describe of His divinity! Say: Glorified be God, and exalted is He above what they attribute!Say: Your God is but one God. There is no God but He, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The number one, then one, God created from it. Will you not then attribute numbers to God? For all numbers are His creation, and all are devoutly obedient to Him.Say: Were there any god besides Him, the order of the heavens and earth and what lies between them would be corrupted. Say: Glorified and exalted is He! All are His worshippers. His command encompasses the heavens and earth and what lies between them, nearer than the utterance "Be, and it is." He is the One Who originates you in every Revelation and brings you forth from a single point. On the day of your return, how is it you do not return to it?We originated you from Muhammad aforetime, so how is it you do not return to your origin? Say: The Essence of the Seven Letters is your origin and your end. On the Day of Resurrection you shall return just as you began. Had We not sent down the Bayan to you or ordained what was revealed therein, what would you possess?Say: Glorified be God and exalted above what they describe! Likewise on the Day of Resurrection, you shall be as you began, with no path except that you return to Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: The example of those is like what passes of your life - you comprehend the beginning of every Revelation, then preserve what God has ordained until its end.Say: The Bayan is nigh unto becoming an essence and a mighty vessel. Thus do you make mention in every name among the names of God. And verily the Furqan was decreed the number of the Gharis. We waited the number of the Ha, then We raised it up. You shall believe in Him Whom God shall purify in the Ha on the Day of Resurrection.That the fruits of your Bayan may appear before your Lord - otherwise after what you have is lifted, nothing of yours will God accept. Therefore have mercy on your souls and hasten in God's Cause. Would those given the Gospel be accepted at their highest essence after God revealed the Furqan? Likewise do you comprehend at every Revelation what God has willed.Say: What God willeth - there is no power except through God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: What God willeth - there is no glory except through the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: What God willeth - there is no power except through God, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the seen and unseen, Lord of all worlds.O all things! You comprehend your origin and your end, for what lies between them is fit if you judge with truth. Whoso recognizes the Point of the Bayan at that time, then Him Whom God shall make manifest - God will forgive what testifies against him between them. Verily there is no God but He, the Forgiving, the Sovereign, the Beloved.But if you ascend to the horizon of piety in your beginning, it will not benefit you on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest unless you ascend at your end according to what God has ordained from His presence. Say: If the glory of every community lies in their faith in God their Lord, how do you not glorify yourselves?O people of the Bayan! Train your souls in such wise that if any trace remains from you after Him Whom God shall make manifest, your Maker may benefit, even as We benefited that Day from the maker of the people of the Gospel.

But if you ascend to the horizon of piety in your early days, it will not profit you on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest unless you also ascend to His presence in your later days, according to what God hath ordained. Say: The glory of every people lies in their faith in God, their Lord. How is it that ye do not seek glory? O people of the Bayan! Train yourselves in such wise that if there remain any trace from you after Him Whom God shall make manifest, it may benefit your Creator, even as what appeared after that Day benefited the Creator of the followers of the Gospel, and the intoxication of the drinkers, that ye may be the best of peoples. Let every Bearer of a Revelation desire to manifest Himself unto you through His Revelation, for ye show patience with what ye possess. We shall manifest and descend in every Revelation while ye may neither manifest nor turn towards it. Say: The Bayan is partly from the tongue of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, partly from the tongue of him whom God hath chosen for Himself, and partly from the tongue of what God hath willed to mention. Ye all interpret everything within its limits, lest the stations of your Cause become too great for you and ye be unable to comprehend them. Say: God hath not created any animal equal to that which correspondeth to the numerical value of Ba, Ra and Ha. Ye benefit from all that God hath created therein. Will ye not then give thanks to God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, and prostrate yourselves according to what He hath permitted you? Were God not to grant you permission, would ye be able to benefit therefrom? Indeed all this is from God and His bounty, but ye neither understand nor remember. Nay, God will be well-pleased on the Day of Resurrection with that animal, as it beareth the mention of His own Name - a bounty from His presence. Verily there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He hath created in the sheep blessings from His presence which ye cannot count. Say: God will multiply what He hath ordained for it in every Revelation beyond what anyone in the worlds can reckon. Say: That animal indeed worshippeth God its Lord, and glorifieth Him, sanctifieth Him, magnifieth Him, exalteth Him, and is among those who beseech God to bestow His grace upon it by making it the sustenance of the Thrones of Reality, or their clothing, or their carpet, or what they possess by God's leave. Say: We have indeed bestowed Our grace upon you and given you possession of the most splendid of what God hath created from the word "Be." Therefore be thankful and be among the thankful in the days of God. Whoso slayeth an animal in the path of God, God will create eleven like it as a bounty from His presence. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: All things shall remember God their Lord on the Day of Resurrection and shall thereby be among the glorious. Say: We have indeed mentioned all things and We were ever mindful of every creation of God, and all stand firm through God their Lord. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Praiseworthy, the Most Praiseworthy. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee.

All things testify that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, Thine the might and the grandeur, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and the sovereignty, Thine the dominion and the realm of creation, Thine the glory and the majesty, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the likeness and the similitudes, Thine the stations and the sublimity, Thine the glory and the invincibility, Thine the power and the transcendence, Thine the gladness and the joy, Thine the greatness and the independence, Thine the authority and the manifestation, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.O my God! Cause all who are in the Bayan to convey all the spirits they bear of all things unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, for verily all that shall be present on the Day of Resurrection before Him, and whatsoever is sent unto Him shall perfume it for the glory of the Cause from His presence. That is what beareth the spirit of that thing, all according to their degrees and stations before Thee. Should anyone bring forth a pen, that one beareth the spirit of the pen; should anyone bring forth paper, that one beareth the spirit of paper; should anyone bring forth ink, that one beareth the spirit of ink. All Thy creation preserveth what Thou hast created; there appeareth from each before Thee what hath been entrusted to it by Thy command. Thou gatherest all things in like manner.By Thy glory! I seek refuge with Thee lest there should appear from anyone among the dwellers of the Bayan that which Thou lovest not to be mentioned, as all shall manifest according to what they bear of words and their meanings, of manifestations and what they contain, of inner significances and what they possess. Glory be to Thee! Present me on the Day of Resurrection before Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, and cause me to bear the spirit of all things which Thou lovest, for Thou presentest every soul before Thee, and whatsoever is below man through what man beareth and presenteth before Thee.O God! Cause all Thy creation to bear the essences of Thy words and the most glorious of what Thou hast created in Thy kingdom, and preserve all Thy creation lest they present unto God, their Lord, that which Thou lovest not. Should every soul conduct itself with every other soul as it would wish for itself, perchance when it presents itself before God its Lord, it may not have acquired what God loveth, or when it presents itself it may not know God its Lord. But God knoweth it through what the Manifestation of Thyself knoweth it, for knowledge of Thee, O my God, appeareth not unto Thy creation except through what appeareth from the Manifestation of Thyself.Glory be to Thee and exalted art Thou! Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing, whether in the heavens or on the earth.

Praise be to God Who has risen in His exaltation above all contingent things, Who has ascended in His elevation above all created beings, Who has become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, Who has become dominant in His dominion above all existence, and Who has become manifest in His manifestation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation bears witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Praised.He has chosen a sublime essence, an exalted camphor-like reality, a resplendent simplicity, a lofty abstraction, and a majestic form. Then He revealed Himself to it through itself, and established it in the station of His being known, His being praised, His being sought, His being loved, His being described, His being thanked, His being feared, His being desired, His being longed for, and His being beheld - for He is too exalted to be praised by any save Him. This is a gleaming veil adorned with various ornaments and a radiant light shining with the brilliance of glory and nobility. God has placed it between Himself and His creation so that through it may reach all that descends from God, and to it may return all that ascends from creation to God. O all things! Convey unto Him Whom God shall make manifest only what is worthy of God, for this is what reaches unto God. Then fear ye Him.I testify that there is no God but Him, the Most Praised, the Most Praised. The glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon what resembles it wherein naught is seen but the First Unity. And further, I bear witness that there is none praised but God - exalted be His glory, universal be His bounty, great be His grandeur, elevated be His station, and impregnable be His proof - for whatever praiseworthy attribute exists in anything, that is from God's manifestation unto it. Therefore, according to the measure of its praised nature, it returns to the manifestation of what God has bestowed upon it from His revelation. And from the lowest dust it ascends until it reaches the Supreme Concourse.I further testify that in that kingdom there is light and fire, truth and falsehood, negation and affirmation, mercy and vengeance, good-pleasure and that which is other than good-pleasure. Every good thing proceeds from Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, and everything other than good proceeds from those who do not prostrate before Him - though they are prostrating before Him through His previous Manifestation, for the Sun appearing in every Manifestation is one Sun. For example, if the people of the Bayan do not prostrate before Him, they are still prostrating before Him through the Point of Truth in the Bayan. And if there were none from among the people of the Bayan, but rather from among the followers of the Gospel, or the Torah, or the Psalms, or the Scriptures that were revealed to the Dawning-Places of Truth, all are prostrating before Him through His previous Manifestations. But since they do not recognize their Manifestation, they do not prostrate before Him nor return unto Him. And were the veil to be lifted from their insight, there would not remain a soul upon the earth except \[...\]

And if the veil be lifted from their eyes, there shall remain not a soul upon the earth but shall fall prostrate before Him, for every soul worshippeth its Lord within itself, and this is the manifestation of that impenetrable Reality which God hath revealed aforetime, and that soul hath embraced His religion. Thus all things are His attributes, exalted and mighty is He. But if that time returneth unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, He will accept it; otherwise it shall remain within its own limits and shall not be worthy to return unto God its Lord, for if a thing be not pure it cannot return unto God. O all things! Purify your attributes from aught save the love of God and His good-pleasure, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may thereby return unto God, your Lord. And it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Fertile, the Most Fertile. There is no God but He, the Most Fertile, the Most Fertile. Say: God is more fertile than all who possess fertility. None can withstand the power of His sovereign fertility, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath ever been the Sower, the Planter, the Cultivator. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be unto God, before Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God shall sow in the earth as He willeth through His command. Do ye not behold? Think ye that ye are the sowers? Say: Glorified be God! We are indeed the Sowers. Say: Look not upon anyone save as ye look upon your highest heights, for what hath been revealed concerning those who are the authorities among you and those who are the foremost in planting is one command - all abide by the command of God. Say: We have sown through Our verses in your hearts and spirits and souls and bodies. Not a letter have We sent down but We have created its fruit sublime in the most exalted paradise on the Day of Resurrection. We have power over all things. And from every letter that We have sent down below the most exalted paradise shall enter therein those who prostrate not before Us. O people of the Bayan! Ye are the fruits of your own selves - waste them not.

From every letter which We have sent down from other than the Most High are such as would admit those who do not bow down before Us. O people of the Bayan! Ye are the fruits of your own selves. Waste not yourselves, but manifest all that ye perform in secret on the Day of Resurrection, if ye be sincere in your deeds. Say: God verily sendeth down from heaven blessed living waters whereby ye sow in the earth. Say: The foremost temples are the dawning-places of all the heavens, and the foremost circles are the rising-points of all the earth. Ye behold in that crystal cup and its earth each one distinct from the other. The splendor of one cannot be compared with another, nor this with that. Thus doth God create your own creation and createth from your camphor essences earthly love wherein ye dwell. Say: Just as one who desireth to sow in the earth loveth to reap its fruits, so must ye sow in soil from which ye shall gather fruits and waste not your lives, for each one thereof is a mighty tree yielding every manner of fruit. Ye ask of God's bounty for every good thing. Thus doth He teach you the cultivation of your return and abiding-place, that ye may, on the Day of Resurrection when He Whom God shall make manifest desireth to send down His verses upon your hearts, act with utmost love and manifest the fruits ye bear of God's Cause as swiftly as ye are able. For whatsoever He Whom God shall make manifest soweth in the lands of your love from the commandments of your Lord must needs yield fruit instantly - those trees which, when planted, bear fruit. Do ye not wish to witness this? Say: The verses of God are like unto living waters sent down from the heaven of Will upon the lands of your nearness - ye who in that moment recognize your Lord. So cleanse your lands through that which descendeth from the heaven of Lordship, then instantly manifest its fruits. Say: How would a bearer be constrained to pour his water upon land not of his kind? Thus do ye observe in the exaltation of the Cause. He Whom God shall make manifest would be constrained to send down His words unto you were ye not to adorn yourselves with what God hath ordained for Him from the exaltation of His Self. O all things! Adorn ye yourselves with your most excellent ornaments for the time when God desireth to manifest Himself unto you through your own selves, that there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Then all who hear will declare: There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: Your likeness is as a goodly land wherein beautiful plants grow - how they rise up by their Lord's command until they yield fruits which ye partake thereof. O all things! Ye are indeed the recipients of the deed of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and this is your glory if ye accept the Cause of God. So refine your souls to the utmost of your ability to become refined, for through your ornaments He would desire to send down the waters of His manifestation upon hearts that have testified there is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Just as your women manifest unto your men the love God hath created within them, so do ye manifest the love of your hearts unto Him Who shall manifest you on the Day of Resurrection. Say: We have sown in all things "There is no God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting," that they may answer Us on the Day of Our Manifestation, when We cause all things to know Our Self: "There is no God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting."

And verily this is your glory if the Cause of God accepts you. Therefore refine your souls to the utmost of your ability to be refined, for through your ornaments He would love to send down the water of His manifestation upon the hearts that have testified that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Just as your women display to your men the love that God has created within them, likewise you should display the love of your hearts for Him Who will manifest Himself on the Day of Resurrection. Say: We have planted in all things that there is no God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that they may respond to Us on the day of Our manifestation when We cause all things to know Our Self, that there is no God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And verily this is He Whom God shall make manifest; we all believe in Him. O ye who possess hearts! Just as your plants adorn themselves for their mates on their first night, likewise should you adorn your hearts for Him Who wishes to manifest Himself unto you through yourselves, that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. If after this you live in glory - well and good. But if you manifest that which is unworthy before God, your Lord, He will not accept you nor send down verses unto you from His presence, whereupon you shall be among those who grieve. If one leaf draws near to a trace while another is prevented, how sorrowful is your domain yet you grieve not. These are they unto whom God has manifested Himself through themselves, and they are the bearers of God's Cause. Verily God does not wish to manifest Himself unto you through yourselves while you veil yourselves from meeting Him, as in the first nights you fail to show the love of your essence. He teaches you the paths of truth from His presence that perchance on the Day of Resurrection you may walk in love as you walk in the love of your desires, and that you may preserve your hearts for God your Lord just as you preserve your leaves. Verily We are the Manifester Who sends down the water of life from the heaven of Our manifestation unto the lands of your purity, that you may testify through what you receive of the water of life that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine is the Glory and the Might, Thine is the Power and the Divine Realm, Thine is the Strength and the Sapphire, Thine is the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine is the Glory and the Majesty, Thine is the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine is the Face and the Perfection, Thine are the Similitudes and the Parables, Thine are the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine is the Strength and the Action, Thine is the Mercy and the Grace, Thine is the Authority and the Justice, Thine are the Similitudes and the Parables, Thine are the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine are the Proofs and the Bounties, Thine is the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine is the Power and the Exaltation, Thine is the Joy and the Gladness, Thine is the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast manifested Thyself unto the Primal Will through itself, by itself, and in itself \[...\]

O God! Thou hast manifested Thyself unto the Primal Will through itself, and hast made it to stand over all things through Thy sovereignty over it and over all things. We testify that whatsoever is beneath these two is affected by its action, submissive to its command, humble before its word, obedient to its will, and tranquil in its presence. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been sovereign in might and majesty. Glorified art Thou! Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, self-sustaining, sovereign, all-compelling, holy, everlasting, eternal, self-dependent, transcendent, inaccessible, and exalted. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son.O God! Create Thou for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest pure hearts which nothing shall touch save Thy love and good-pleasure, at such time as He willeth to adorn them with His presence. Verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone, without partner. O God! Cause Thou to reach from the summit of hearts unto the leaves of Thy paradise, that they may convey unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest the most excellent of what Thou hast created in the Bayan and the most splendid of what Thou hast brought forth in exposition. For within Thy grasp lie the kingdoms of creation and origination, and the realms of might and invention. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the King Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things.O God! Choose Thou for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest from among the unity those who will answer when He saith unto them from Thy presence: "Am I not your Lord, your Creator, your King, and your Sovereign?" And they shall say: "Yea." O God! Unite the beauty of their hearts and their forms, their first and their last, their outward and their inward, lest the sun of Thy love be veiled from any of the manifestations of Thy appearance and the dawning-places of Thy concealment. For on the Day of Resurrection, Thou hast ordained no lineage among Thy creatures. Whoso loveth Thee through the Manifestation of Thyself, such a one hast Thou chosen.O God! Choose Thou for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest lofty manifestations, exalted, transcendent, mighty, and sovereign through Thy power over all things. Verily Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, Who hath made Himself victorious in His victory above all created things, and Who hath made Himself powerful in His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His are the most excellent names. All that are in the heavens and on the earth and between them glorify Him. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.He hath manifested Himself unto all that is in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. And verily His manifestation unto the kingdom of earth is like unto a sower, and with Him is a single water of life, when it descendeth every atom receiveth its portion according to its measure \[...\]

When the Single One descends, each atom receives its share and portion according to its capacity and within its bounds. Look not at the mirrors, nor be veiled from their attributes, for what appears in them and what lies within them is the Primal Will, the Divine Countenance, the Face of Lordship, the Eternal Mark, and the Everlasting Sign whereby God hath established the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, and through which each one hath recognized that there is no God but Him, the Single One, the Sower, the Fourth in the Fourth.In the Name of God, the Most Fertile, the Most Fertile! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Fertile, the Most Fertile! And verily the glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon them that resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity.Furthermore, We bear witness that We have taught thee in Our signs that all names in their rank and station are like the Most Great, Most Exalted Name. For if there were no manifestation of the Sower in the kingdom, from whom would the manifestation of sovereignty draw sustenance? And likewise with all the attributes between them which none can reckon save God, the Single One, the All-Knowing.Therefore, behold no believing soul except with the eye of recognition as the throne for the manifestation of the Sun of Reality, mirrors of the dawning of the Divine Power, stars of Oneness, and lamps of Eternality. When thou art thus, call upon God by all His names, for unto Him belong all the most beautiful names in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them.Perchance thou mayest enter a mighty city wherein there is but one Name of God, and this is the focus of God's gaze and the repository of God's bounty for those in that land. Thou shalt not recognize this until the Day of Resurrection when He Whom God shall make manifest will make Himself known. Then thou shalt say: "Yea! Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Thou hast manifested what Thou didst promise to all Thy creation, a grace from Thee, a existence from Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Bestower, the Generous; Thou art the Munificent, the Bountiful; Thou art the Gracious, the Kind; Thou art the Compassionate, the Near One; Thou art the Living, the Awesome."And it hath four stations. The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Mighty! There is no God but He, the Most Mighty, the Most Mighty! Say: God is mightier than any mighty one. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can resist the power of His sovereign might. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Strong. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death \[...\]

He causes to die and then causes to die and gives life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the Sovereign Whose dominion passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Ruler Whose authority changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God createth you as He willeth by His command. Will ye not see? Is there any god besides God who is able to create you and sustain you and cause you to die and give you life? Will ye not consider? Say: Within the grasp of your Lord lieth the kingdom of your beginning and your end. On the Day of Resurrection ye shall be brought before God, your Lord. Say: How do ye wish to sow in the earth of clay if ye be not certain? Nothing would grow therein were ye not to sow. Thus do ye witness your own creation. Naught can be sown except in the earth from which its fruits appear. God showeth you His signs that ye may be thankful. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them, and unto Him shall all return.Say: Through a drop of water God createth the form of man and woman. How is it that ye preserve not what God hath created in that water? Preserve ye it even as ye preserve your own selves, that ye may thereby find guidance on the Day of Resurrection in the waters of your Lord's mercy, that perchance when God manifesteth Himself unto you, ye may prostrate yourselves before God. Say: How do ye not sow except in good earth? Likewise, He Whom God shall make manifest desireth not to sow the words of your Lord except in hearts that have glorified their Lord. Therefore make the soil of your hearts and spirits and souls and bodies such that when the Command from God is planted therein, there may appear therefrom the fruits that have been ordained in the Book, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may find salvation in the Faith of God.Say: This is the day of your presentation before God your Lord, inasmuch as ye are presented before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: How all letters proceed from the Point - likewise do ye all proceed from Him Whom God shall make manifest, then are ye brought forth in a new creation. Exalted be God, the Lord of sovereignty and dominion! Exalted be God, the Possessor of might and omnipotence! Exalted be God, the Lord of power and divinity! Exalted be God, the Possessor of strength and glory! Exalted be God, the Lord of dominion and humanity! Exalted be God, the Possessor of majesty and grandeur! Exalted be God, the Lord of beauty and grace! Exalted be God, the Possessor of the Face and perfection! Exalted be God, the Lord of might and action! Exalted be God, the Possessor of mercy and bounty! Exalted be God, the Lord of sovereignty and justice! Exalted be God, the Possessor of all similitudes \[...\]

Exalted is God, Possessor of similitudes and parables! Exalted is He, Lord of stations and grandeur! Exalted is God, Possessor of majesty and independence! Exalted is He, Lord of glory and sublimity! Exalted is God, Possessor of might and invincibility! Exalted is He, Lord of sovereignty and power! Say: God hath created naught except for Him Whom He shall make manifest. Ye are all, every one of you, possessed of dominion through His permission. This is the dominion of your Lord, if ye but knew it. Say: On the day of His manifestation, were there none on earth but the people of the Bayan, and were they to believe in Him when they hear His verses, there would descend upon them from their Lord that which God hath in His possession; but should anyone fail to believe in Him, not even the weight of a mustard seed would be bestowed upon him unless he prostrateth himself before Him. Thus have We nurtured that creation, and verily We shall be witness over them on the Day of Resurrection, that We may inform them of their deeds in Our path, for verily We are cognizant of all things. Yet ye shall not be questioned save about what ye have earned. On that Day, if ye believe in the Truth, God will make your deeds righteous from before - will ye not then be grateful? But if ye veil yourselves from God's Cause, He will render void your souls and your deeds from a beginning that hath no beginning. Therefore fear God concerning this, that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection. Ye dwell in your homes, holding a Book in your hands, reading what is therein, yet ye perceive not that this is from God Who created you, sustaineth you, causeth you to die, and giveth you life. It hath been sent down by Him Whom God shall make manifest unto you, that ye might be guided by His appearance. Why do ye not understand a matter when ye read it, failing to be guided by the proofs contained therein? Thus do ye depart from your faith and enter into the fire through your heedlessness. O all things! Have mercy upon yourselves by pondering with truth upon all that ye observe, rather than looking to him who bringeth it to you or conveyeth it unto you. Yea, look ye unto that which hath been revealed therein of conclusive proofs, that ye may thereby be saved on the Day of Resurrection. For by this doth God render your deeds void while ye perceive it not. When ye look upon the Book, were ye to be certain within yourselves, ye would present yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest and prostrate yourselves. But since your hearts have become remote from the remembrance of God, ye dwell in one matter while reciting the Book, yet fail to attain certitude thereby. Have mercy upon yourselves, for this is greater than what was revealed before unto you, even were it but a single line, if ye would but slightly perceive. For by this shall ye be saved on the Day of Resurrection, whereas by what ye possess ye shall not be saved, but rather shall be tried. This is what God, your Lord, hath counseled you, that in all your affairs ye might understand and then reflect. Otherwise, were ye not to believe in the Book, ye would by your own selves depart from God's religion. And God is independent of you and your faith, whereas ye are in need of God. Were God not to bear witness unto you through guidance and faith, ye would not be able to find tranquility. But if ye believe in the Book, then by your own selves shall ye enter Paradise. This is of God's bounty unto you, if ye would follow with your minds what God inspires within you. The Second in the Second. In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness \[...\]

And if you believe in the Book, then you shall enter Paradise with your own souls. This is from God's grace upon you, if you, with your minds, follow what God inspires you with.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Originating, the Most Originating!Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine is the might and the power, Thine is the strength and the divinity, Thine is the force and sovereignty, Thine is the majesty and the glory, Thine is the countenance and the beauty, Thine is the face and the perfection, Thine is the mercy and the grace, Thine is the authority and the justice, Thine are the similitudes and examples, Thine are the stations and the grandeur, Thine is the greatness and independence, Thine is the pride and sublimity, Thine is the might and invincibility, Thine is the power and exaltation, Thine is the joy and gladness, Thine is the sovereignty and omnipotence, and whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been and none existed before Thee as creator or originator or bestower of mercy or giver of death or sustainer or quickener or benefactor. Sanctified are Thy names in their beginning and their end, their outward and their inward aspects. All Thy servants and worshippers glory in this before Thee and Thy creation, and take pride in it before Thee and Thy servants. For whoso worships Thee not shall find no peace with Thee or with Thy creation.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast originated all that Thou hast originated by Thy command, and brought into being all that Thou hast brought into being by Thy wisdom, and invented all that Thou hast invented by Thy oneness, and created all that Thou hast created by Thy decree, and established all that Thou hast established by Thy deeds. Nothing exists besides Thee except that it is affected by Thy creative power and brought into existence by Thy creation. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, everlasting, sovereign, supreme, holy, perpetual, enduring. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou givest life and death, then death and life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.The Third in the Third:In the Name of God, the Most Originating, the Most Originating!Praise be to God Who hath originated all existing things from nothing by His Will, and brought all contingent things into being from naught by His Purpose, and invented all created things by His Power, and produced all atoms by His Decree, and established all that is in the kingdom of earth and heavens by His leave, and created all that is in the kingdom \[...\]

Praise be to Him Who created all that is in the kingdoms, the beginnings and the endings in their time, and fashioned all that was and will be created by His command in the heaven of beings and the earth of essences through His decree. I testify, and all creation testifies with me, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious - a testimony that has appeared from independence in the shadow of the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and was created from stability in the glory of Him Whom God shall exalt. A testimony resplendent, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, pleasing, knowing, powerful, loving, noble, sovereign, ruling, transcendent. A testimony adorned with essence and substance of being, with spiritual fragrance and divine abstraction, with celestial ornament. A testimony that fills the pillars of all things with lofty and exalted praise, with sublime and impenetrable glory to God Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them by His command. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great.Then I testify, and all creation testifies, that among the dawning rays of His effulgence, the daysprings of His manifestation of being, the lamps of His guidance and evidences, the keys of His glorious wisdom, the proof and fountains of His glorious mercy and grace, is an essence sublime and lofty, a purity exalted, a radiance manifest, a beauty graceful, a glory and grandeur wondrous. Then He revealed Himself to it through it while remaining beyond it, and cast into its reality the likeness of itself. Thus were His signs made manifest through it, and the heavens and earth and all between them were filled with His manifestations.This is the beginning of what God has sent down to all things, and the veil of what is raised up to God from all things. I testify, and all created things testify, that it possesses decisive verses which all the worlds are powerless to comprehend or produce the like thereof; supplications profound which all the worlds fall short of understanding or uttering; discourses impenetrable whose unfathomability all beings witness in the depths of beginnings and endings; sublime ornaments, divine essences, lordly embellishments, eternal dawnings and divine flashings - whose comprehension and wondrous intimations have bewildered the loftiest peaks of essence and the most elevated abstractions of being.This is what shall endure from His presence until the Day of Reckoning. And as for what has shone forth, gleamed, flashed and risen from His most beautiful attributes - who can enumerate or preserve them save God Who created them, sustains them, causes them to die and brings them to life? His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. All abide by His command.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Creative, the Most Creative. Praise be to God, there is no God but Him, the Most Creative, the Most Creative. And verily the Glory of God be upon the First One and upon those who resemble that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that the meaning of "dharr" (creation) is to bring into being, and the meaning of bringing into being is to originate, and the meaning of originating is to innovate, and the meaning of innovating is to produce - these are radiant manifestations declaring that there is no God but God, the Creator of all things through His independence.

The meaning of 'invented' is the creation of those brilliant manifestations which declare that there is no God but God, Who originates all things with independence and creates all things with independence. These are different names for one manifestation. For example, when He Whom God shall make manifest - exalted be His glory - reveals a command which had no existence before, then the meanings of invention and origination are attributed to it. And that command appears through the Primal Will; to it is attributed the name of origination from Purpose, the name of creation from Destiny, the name of occurrence from Decree, the name of origination from Permission, the name of invention from Term, the name of creation from Time. Then at the Book, the creation of that thing is completed through its causes. These are mirrors reflecting that the one command in these seven conditions is one, and these are names manifested in the impregnable appearances in mirrors. Otherwise, glorified and exalted is He above what they describe.And it has four ranks. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Pre-eternal of Pre-eternals. God, there is no God but He, the Pre-eternal of Pre-eternals. Say: God is more pre-eternal than every possessor of pre-eternity. None in the heavens or the earth or what lies between them can withstand the dominion of His pre-eternal sovereignty. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been pre-eternally pre-eternal. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Reality, then the Strength and the Essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human Reality. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that deviateth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or in the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Kingdom and Dominion. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Might and Omnipotence. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Strength and Essence. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Power and Divine Reality. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Sovereignty and Human Reality. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Glory and Majesty. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Beauty and Comeliness. Sanctified is the Possessor of Countenance and Perfection. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Strength and Action. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Mercy and Grace. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Authority and Justice. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Dominion. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Kingdom and Sovereignty. Sanctified is God, the Possessor of Grandeur and Independence.

Sanctified be God, the Lord of grandeur and majesty! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of similitudes and parables! Sanctified be God, the Lord of loftiness and glory! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of might and invincibility! Sanctified be God, the Lord of power and exaltation! Sanctified be the Lord of joy and gladness! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of sovereignty and dominion! Sanctified be God, the Lord of victory and triumph! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of conquest and domination! Sanctified be God, the Lord of compulsion and omnipotence! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of grandeur and glory! Sanctified be God, the Lord of manifestation and appearance! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of subjugation and authority! Sanctified be God, the Lord of bounties and favors! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of wonders and grace! Sanctified be God, the Lord of might and radiance! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of majesty and magnificence! Sanctified be God, the Lord of generosity and benevolence! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of grace and favor! Sanctified be God, the Lord of providence and ascendancy! Sanctified be God, the Possessor of bounties and grandeur! Sanctified be God, the Lord of might and glory! Sanctified be the Possessor of majesty and detachment! Sanctified be God, the Lord of signs and evidences!He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, and verily there is no God but Him, the All-Glorious, the Most High. Prostrate thyself before none save God, Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. Verily there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Glorious. He it is within Whose grasp lieth the kingdom of all things. There is no God but Him, the One, the All-Beautiful.Say: God hath ever been, from time immemorial, and shall ever continue to be, from everlasting to everlasting. All are His worshippers. Say: Verily, the name nearest to God is the name of the Ancient. Through it do ye turn unto God, your Lord. Through it do ye possess all good. Through it will God bestow upon you the glory of His might - will ye not be illumined? Through it will He confer upon you the majesty of His Cause - will ye not be exalted? Through it will God bestow upon you the beauty of His countenance - will ye not be beautified? Through it will God bestow upon you the greatness of His Self - will ye not be magnified? Through it will God bestow upon you the light of His presence - will ye not be illuminated?All this hath God attributed unto His Own Self, if ye would but truly witness. Otherwise, how could that which befitteth God be conveyed to His servants? All were created by His command, and all are His worshippers. The Fashioner of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them is nearer than that He should say to a thing "Be!" and it is.Verily, I am God, there is no God but Me. I have been from all eternity, before and after, and all worship Me. I shall continue to be for all eternity, and all prostrate before Me. This is the path of God in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Glory on that Day belongeth unto God alone, the One, the Ancient of Days, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, the One, the Most High, the All-Glorious. He it is within Whose grasp lieth the kingdom of all things. There is no God but Him, the One, the All-Glorious, the Most High. Say: Verily God knoweth what is in the heavens \[...\]

He is the One, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious! In His grasp lies the dominion of all things. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling, the Most High. Say: God knoweth what is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. Verily, there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. Say: God hath power over all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing. Say: God hath power over all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Powerful. Unto God belongeth all that He hath created and will create of all things, and God is the sovereign Lord, the Mighty, the Unassailable. His is all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the Most Great. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. He it is Who originateth the creation of all things by His command. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. Is there any god besides God who can send down a single verse? Say: Glorified be God and exalted above what they describe. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Such is God, your Lord. His is the Creation and the Command. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the All-Compelling, the Best-Beloved. Say: As He pleaseth, He shall surely gather together His loved ones. Ye transgress in what hath been revealed in the Bayan. Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Splendid, the All-Glorious, the Most Resplendent. His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Ancient of the Ancient, the Most Ancient. Say: The Light that shineth from the Dayspring of eternity, by which all things are created - that is the light which hath shone upon those who believed in God before all things. Thus doth God show you the realities of your knowledge through your own eyes, that ye may cease to utter your vain imaginings. Say: The Primal Point is the Sun of eternity, would that ye knew. That is the first that God chose for Himself, and by it are all things created. And that which shineth upon your forms is a light that hath shone from the Dayspring of eternity, by which ye all live. From a light that hath shone from the Dayspring of eternity - yet ye are as dead ones who know not. If ye would live, ye shall soon know and be convinced. This is what was withheld from him who asked about it, and this is a word from His presence. Verily, He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God will surely bless those who have believed in God and His signs, and they are guided by the light of God. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Ancient of the Ancient! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, and Thine is the might and the sovereignty, and Thine is the power \[...\]

Thine is the power and the sovereignty of divinity; Thine is the might and the chrysolite; Thine is the dominion and the realm of humanity; Thine is the majesty and the glory; Thine is the countenance and the beauty; Thine is the face and the perfection; Thine is the reverence and exaltation; Thine is the might and deeds; Thine is the mercy and grace; Thine is the authority and justice; Thine is the grandeur and magnificence; Thine is the glory and invincibility; Thine is the power and transcendence; Thine is the joy and gladness; Thine is the sovereignty and dominion; Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou art the First, O my God, and there is naught before Thee; Thou art the Last, O my Beloved, and there is naught after Thee; Thou art the Manifest, O my Desire, and there is naught besides Thee; Thou art the Hidden, O my Worshipped One, and there is naught beyond Thee. Thou art the Eternal in the glory of eternity; Thou hast ever been eternal, everlasting, perpetual, and Thou shalt ever be eternal, everlasting, perpetual. Glorified art Thou, and exalted; sanctified are Thy names and transcendent are Thy likenesses. All things worship Thee in Thy true oneness and prostrate before Thee in Thy true uniqueness and sanctify Thee in Thy true eternal sovereignty and magnify Thee in Thy true supremacy and glorify Thee in Thy true omnipotence and exalt Thee in Thy true dominion and manifest Thy Cause in Thy true revelation. How lofty is Thy loftiness, wherein all that is exalted boweth down before Thee, and how resplendent is Thy transcendence, wherein all that is elevated worshippeth Thee! I testify that every object of worship besides Thee is vain before Thee, and every object of desire other than Thee perisheth in Thy presence. Thou art the One worthy to be sought, and if any seek aught else, it is only because Thou hast so commanded. Thou art the One worthy to be worshipped in Thy majesty, and if anyone loveth aught, it is through Thy love. Glorified and exalted art Thou! I have sought none but Thee and worshipped none but Thee. Fill Thou the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them with the light that shineth from the morn of Thine eternity and the light of Thy pre-existence upon the temples of the dwellers of the paradise of Thy oneness and the inhabitants of the glorious gardens of Thy unity, and whatsoever Thou hast quickened from the kingdom of Thy Cause and the heaven of Thy lordship. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, everlasting, self-subsisting, sovereign, all-powerful, holy, ever-abiding. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in Thy creation nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. All the Messengers are heralds of the kingdom of Thy oneness, and all the Books are derived from the sublimity of Thy holiness and Thine eternity. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. The Third in the Third. In the name of God, the Eternal, the Eternal. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings through the sovereignty of His eternity.

Praise be to God Who, by virtue of His exaltation, has risen above all contingent things through the sovereignty of His eternity, and Who has elevated Himself above all created things through His ancient dominion, and Who has established Himself above all beings through the might of His oneness, and Who has shown His grandeur above all atoms through His majesty and sanctified divinity, and Who has exercised His authority over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven through the compelling power of His singular sovereignty, and Who has manifested His might above all things through the revelation of the signs of His omnipotence, and Who has exhibited His glory above all things through the manifestation of His eternal majesty. Therefore, at this moment all His creation bears witness that there is no God but Him, the One, the Eternal, the Powerful, the Single, the Omnipotent, the Independent, the Everlasting, the Exalted, the Pre-existent. He has risen through His exaltation above all who bow down before His countenance, and has ascended through His elevation above the horizon of all who worship His face.He has chosen His Own sublime Essence, and His Own abstract Reality, and His Own delicate whiteness, and His Own primal simplicity, and His Own eternal Being. Then He revealed Himself to it through it, and cast into its identity the likeness of its own self. Through it His actions have become manifest and His heavens and earth have been filled, testifying that there is no God but Him, the One, the Pre-existent, and that the Being of the Seven Letters is the countenance of His eternity, the face of His ancientness, the sign of His oneness, the lamp of His unity, and the manifestations of the glory of His uniqueness. Through Him He has ordained the paths of all things along the most elevated ways of might and loftiness, and the most exalted roads of glory and elevation, that those who seek proofs may find in all things the evidence that there is no God but Him, the One, the Pre-existent.Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Pre-existent, the Pre-existent. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whosoever resembles that Unity wherein naught can be seen except the Primal Unity. And furthermore, I bear witness that God, exalted and mighty be He, has chosen for Himself two mighty attributes which befit none other than Him and cannot be ascribed to any of His creation: First, the attribute of Pre-existence, and second, the quality of Eternity. Verily these are mentioned in the Pre-existence of pre-existences and the Most Ancient of ancientness as God of gods, or Lord of lords, or King of kings, or Sovereign of sovereigns, or Knower of all worlds, or Subduer of subduers, and similar transcendent manifestations. None of these are conjoint attributes, for that which is ascribed to God of Pre-existence is different from what is ascribed to others beneath Him. For when you say "sun" referring to mirrors and "sun" referring to the sky, the term "sun" applied to mirrors is but a reflection in relation to the term you apply to the sun in the sky. Similarly, bear witness and find proof in all these names as I have informed you from God, the One, the Supreme, the Exalted, for the pre-existence and eternity attributed to creation are not like the pre-existence attributed to God \[...\]

That which is primordial - this is not like what is attributed to God in terms of pre-existence and eternity, for both of these are created at the level of creation. Verily, He, glorified be He, is far greater than and devoid of His creation and the attributes of His creation, and is exalted above His servants and the conditions of His servants, for all else but Him are clothed in the garment of limitations and mortality - how then could they be worthy \[...\]

The mention of eternity, everlastingness, pre-existence and glory, but when applied as I have informed thee regarding the Sun of the Mirrors, the Sun of Heaven, call upon God by that Name that perchance on the Day of Resurrection thou mayest be among those who are saved. It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. There is no God but He, the Most Great, the Most Great. Say: God is greater than every possessor of greatness. None can resist the sovereign power of His grandeur, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the All-Great, the Most Great, the Great. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them make mention. Say: All are submissive unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Dominion and the Human Kingdom. He causeth to live and causeth to die, then causeth to die and causeth to live. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily bounty in your knowledge is if ye but know. Say: Verily grace is in your guidance if ye but witness. For one to bring guidance to a single soul or save it on the Day of Resurrection is better than all that is on earth, if ye but know. Say: Nay, by my Lord, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting! To save a single soul on the Day of Resurrection is better than bestowing upon it all that is on earth, for this one after death entereth Paradise, but if one guideth him not, he entereth the Fire and what was given him profiteth him not. Why do ye not witness the bounty of Truth in His guidance, nor render thanks even a little? Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. He upholdeth the creation of all things by His command. Verily He is the Strong, the Mighty, the Great. His is whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. He giveth life and causeth death, and He hath power over all things. And unto God belongeth the glory of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is glory glorious glorious. And unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is majesty majestic majestic. And unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens \[...\]

And unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Beauteous, the Beautifier, the Beautiful. And unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Great, the Magnifier, the Grand. And unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Luminous, the Illuminator, the Light-Giving. And unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Merciful, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And unto God belong the words of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Perfect, the Perfecter, the Complete. And unto God belong the names of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Great, the Magnifier, the Great One. And unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Powerful, the Strengthener, the Mighty. And unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Knowing, the Knower, the Omniscient. And unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Powerful, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. And unto God belongeth the strength of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Strong, the Strengthener, the Powerful. Say: All the names ye behold in the Bayan after the One, these are from another One; ye shall understand one by one, that ye may not be veiled from the mystery of the One, and that on the Day of Resurrection ye may be saved through the First One in the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest. And unto God belong the questions of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Loving, the Lover, the Beloved. And unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Ruling, the Ruler, the Sovereign. And unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Possessing, the Possessor, the King. And unto God belongeth the loftiness of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the Exalter, the High. And unto Him belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and He is the Single One, the Subtle. And unto God belongeth that which is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Bountiful, the Beneficent, the Gracious. And unto God belongeth the grace of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Gracious, the Gracious, the Beneficent. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and He is the Preserver of all things. That is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. He it is Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. And unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God was possessed of mighty and true power. His is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God encompasseth all things. Say: In whose hand is the dominion of all things? And verily unto Him shall all return. Say: In God's hand, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and verily unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: He is the One Who standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and witnessing what it earneth, and verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: Ye are the dawning-places of your own hearts; ye know not, unless He Whom God shall make manifest informeth you by what name ye are guided and by what name ye shall be called upon to testify before God, your Lord.

Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: You are the daysprings of your own hearts, yet you know not, unless He Whom God shall make manifest informs you by what name you are guided, and then by what name you shall inform God, your Lord and the Lord of your ancient forebears, God your Lord and the Lord of your manifest brethren, God your Lord and the Lord of your manifest sisters, God your Lord and the Lord of your departed grandmothers, God your Lord and the Lord of your pure leaves, God your Lord and the Lord of your detached kinswomen. Say: All are from God; there is no God but He, the One, the All-Compelling. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Most Great, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Compelling. Say: In the disconnected letters there is a remembrance from God aforetime in the Furqan, through which you comprehend all good. Say: All the disconnected letters, when not counted as repeated, equal not the name of the Most Great in the Book of God, by which you magnify God, your Lord. And if you count their letters without counting the repetitions, they speak forth in the Mother Book: "This is the straight path of 'Ali which We uphold; verily We are the Preservers of all things." Through it God enriches whomsoever He willeth of His servants; verily He hath power over all things. Through it God preserveth whomsoever He willeth of His servants; verily He hath power over all things. Through it God preserveth whomsoever He willeth of His servants; verily He is cognizant of all things. Through it God exalteth whomsoever He willeth of His servants; verily He encompasseth all things. And unto God belongeth the power in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is a mighty, powerful Sovereign. Say: Verily God writeth as He willeth by His command; verily He hath power over all things. Say: God sendeth down from His presence whatsoever He willeth by His command, and God is the Subtle, the Inaccessible, the Exalted.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most GreatGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm, then the Glory and the Majesty, then the Power and the Perfection, then the Similitude and the Examples, then the Stations and the Grandeur, then the Authority and the Justice, then the Pride and the Revelation, then the Greatness and the Omnipotence, then the Might and the Inaccessibility, then the Power and the Transcendence, then the Joy and the Gladness, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Eternal, Individual, Ever-living, Self-subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, inasmuch as Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and there hath been no partner for Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thy way hath ever been, in every Dispensation, to raise up the house of Thy manifestation, then when the Book reacheth its appointed time, Thou dost begin another house and Thou dost desire to raise up the other house \[...\]

Glorified art Thou, and exalted art Thou! Thou lovest to raise up another House and to establish all that Thou hast raised therein. Through this are made manifest the seats of Thy command and prohibition, and the dawning-places of Thy power and might in every Revelation. Otherwise, there would be no Manifest One in the manifestations except Thee, no Hidden One in the concealments save Thee, no Inaccessible One in the essences except Thee, and no Transcendent One in the abstractions but Thee.O God! Do Thou create workers for the raising up of that House and the establishment of that House, for verily Thou hast ever been powerful over all things and inaccessible above all things. Thou hast ever been triumphant above all contingent beings, manifest above all existing things, inaccessible above all created things, and exalted above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thou art transcendent above all atoms, mighty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of beginning and end, and sovereign over all things through the sovereign power of might and independence, and the dominion of power and majesty.Never have Thy blessings been such that any of Thy creation could enumerate them, and Thy bounties too exalted for any of Thy servants to render adequate thanks. Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then cause to die and to live. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things.O God! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection with all that Thou possesseth through Thy power, might, glory, grandeur, sovereignty, eternity, self-subsistence, loftiness, perpetuity, signs and holiness. For verily nothing escapeth Thy knowledge, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and nothing in the kingdom of command or creation or below it can frustrate Thee. Verily Thou art All-Knowing, All-Powerful, All-Wise.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all created things, manifested Himself in His manifestation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, magnified Himself in His magnificence above all atoms, raised Himself in His elevation above all evidences, and made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all signs. His creation beareth witness, and He Himself testifieth, that there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling.He hath chosen an inaccessible essence, a glorious abstraction, an eternal reality, a divine archetype, and a pristine purity. Then He revealed Himself to it through it and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Then His sign appeared through it and filled His heaven and His earth, testifying that there is no God but Him. He hath ordained the paths of all things in the Bayan.

Praise be to God Who hath ordained, in the Bayan, the path of all things, and hath held, by His power, the creation of all things within the Book, and hath directed the affairs of all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them through His manifestations in creation. I render unto Him such praise as none among all created things hath ever rendered before Me, and I offer Him such thanksgiving as none among all existing things shall ever offer after Me - praise resplendent and gleaming, and thanksgiving manifest and radiant, whereby the pillars of all things are filled with the light of His glorification, and the essences of all things with the manifestations of His sanctification, and the realities of all things with the evidences of His exaltation, and the souls of all things with the expressions of His magnification, and the beings of all things with the mysteries of His unification - praise that none besides Him can encompass in knowledge, and none can reckon save Him. His is the creation and the command, both before and after, all abide by His bidding.The Fourth in the FourthIn the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great! Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Most Great, the Most Great! And verily the Glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whatsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen except the Primal Unity. I bear witness that grandeur and majesty befit none save God, exalted be His glory, and this is the mantle of His names' loftiness and God's might and the sublimity of His attributes. But thou, in the essence of unity and the pure abstraction and the pristine praise and the camphor of glorification, seest not in the station of pure manifestation the transcendent names, for His is the grandeur through His essence, and the majesty through His reality, and the exaltation through His eternity, and the inaccessibility through His antiquity, and the independence through His supremacy. And whatsoever the creation comprehendeth of greatness that their hearts have known - how then can they present God's grandeur and His majesty, and God's glory and His sovereignty? Verily thy heart perceiveth that every great one boweth before Him because of His grandeur, and every mighty one is humbled before Him because of His majesty, and every wealthy one is made poor before Him because of His exalted grace, and every powerful one is brought low before Him because of His supreme inaccessibility, and every lofty one is enslaved to Him because of His supreme exaltation. When thou shalt attain unto the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest and shalt behold all who are on earth prostrating themselves before Him in their inmost hearts and outwardly, then less than a needle's eye of God's grandeur will have been manifested upon the forms of all contingent beings possible in the realm of creation. Otherwise, that which cannot be manifested - how could it be mentioned? This is a mention of thy Lord's grandeur and the majesty of thy Creator. God hath made Him Whom God shall make manifest - exalted and glorified be His remembrance, and elevated and sublime be His station - the repository of that grandeur and the treasury of that majesty and exaltation. If thou submittest to His grandeur, then thou hast fulfilled thy Lord's grandeur, and if thou art humble before His majesty, then thou hast been illumined by thy Lord's majesty. Otherwise, thou hast believed His grandeur to be imaginary and His majesty to be fanciful in thy knowledge but not in thy deeds, and neither thy knowledge nor thy deeds shall profit thee except \[...\]

And none of thy deeds shall be of avail save that which profiteth thee on the Day of Resurrection before God, Who is before Him Whom God shall make manifest. And on the day of His manifestation, thou mayest deem thyself great and mighty in thine own estimation and words, but consider from the beginning of thy life unto its end to whom thou dost prostrate and to whom thou dost turn. This is a sign which God hath revealed unto thee from Him Whom God shall make manifest, within thine own heart before His manifestation, and thou canst not wax proud before Him or be veiled from Him. For if thou art veiled from Him on the day of His manifestation, thou art prostrating to His previous Manifestation and submitting to the dawning of His mystery. Therefore, bring thy hidden state into harmony with thy visible state if thou desirest to benefit therefrom. Otherwise, He is independent of thee and of all the worlds.And it hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. Say: God is more exalted than all who are exalted. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His exalted sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been supremely exalted, transcendently glorious. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in worship. And praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth. He is powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God is more exalted than all things, and all before Him are prostrate in worship. Say: God hath ever been transcendent in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and exalted in the kingdom of Command and Creation and what lieth beneath them. All are His servants and all are devoted to Him. Say: These are among the dwellers of the Psalms where descendeth the form which hath come down from heaven. They imagine they worship God their Lord, and they remember Him by night and by day, but God beareth witness that there is no God but He, and they are in four manifestations, and aforetime they were guided by God, but after God sent down the Books unto the Messengers, when they became veiled, they entered the fire and they shall not be helped except \[...\]

And they will not be helped except if they enter into the Bayan and then become certain of their Lord's command. Verily We have ordained for them their religion, but on that Day they will not recognize Us, nor will they return unto God their Lord. O people of the Bayan! Have mercy upon yourselves. Do not remain, after Him Whom God shall make manifest, in that which God hath given you aforetime, lest He bear witness against you without guidance and make you like unto those who were given the Book before you. Fear God, then, and unto Him shall ye return. Say: Verily your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest is your return unto God your Lord. Ye desire to return unto God your Lord. Say: God is independent of all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them, but ye are poor in your faith in God and His signs. What aileth you that ye fear not God? Say: Verily We shall purify you in every Manifestation, causing you to enter into God's religion and bringing you out of that wherein ye were before. What aileth you that ye remember not? Say: From the beginning that hath no beginning until now, We have been witness unto all things, but they await not the testimony of their Lord and act according to their own testimonies. Say: Your own testimonies will profit you not on the Day of Resurrection before Him Whom God shall make manifest, save what God testifieth concerning you. O people of the Bayan! Fear ye all together the Day when God desireth to take what is with you and give you what He pleaseth. This is the Day of Truth. Even as ye took before, so shall ye take, and even as ye return deposits one to another, so unto Him Whom God shall make manifest shall ye return what is with you. What is with you shall profit you not, even to the weight of a grain of mustard seed. Did their patience profit those who were given the Gospel, or those who were before them? What aileth you that ye remember not? And unto God belong the issues of all matters, both before and after. There is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God hath ordained carnelian for you and made it an ornament in your hands whereby ye may attain unto all good. And if ye engrave upon it a verse from the Book of God, it will draw sustenance for you by the quickest means, whether ye labor on land or sea. Thus doth God bestow His grace upon you, His servants. O My servants, fear ye God! All belong to God and all shall return unto God their Lord. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God giveth life and causeth to die, then causeth to die and giveth life, and verily unto God their Lord shall all return. Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them? Say: God. How then are ye not thankful? And there is no God but God, the Lord of all worlds. Unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. All love God, their Lord, the Merciful, and all are submissive unto Him. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and verily unto Him shall all return. His are the keys of the heavens and earth \[...\]

I testify, O my God, and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without peer. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Glory and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Might and the Sovereignty, Thine the Dominion and the earthly realm. Thine is Majesty and Grandeur, Thine the Countenance and Beauty, Thine the Face and Perfection, Thine the Likeness and the Similitudes, Thine are the stations and the Glories, Thine the Might and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Transcendence, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Might and the Inaccessibility, Thine the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Cause and Creation. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, the Self-Sustaining, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself no consort.By His command doth He create whatsoever He willeth, and all are His servants, all abide by His bidding. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Almighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: He is manifest above His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore put your trust in God, your Lord, the Sovereign, that ye may be delivered on the Day of Resurrection. If ye put your trust in Him Whom God shall manifest, then shall ye be delivered on the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Judgment. Otherwise ye shall not be able to trust in God. This is the Gate of God if ye truly desire Him.His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: In His hand is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and all worship Him. Say: How is it that ye believe not in Him Whom God shall manifest, the Gate of Guidance? And if ye believe, how is it that ye are not certain? And if ye are certain, how is it that ye aid Him not? And if ye aid Him, how is it that ye preserve not your own selves? Then how is it that ye choose not His harbingers? And if ye choose, how is it that ye spend not of what God hath given you in the path of Truth, that He may exalt His Most Great Word above those who refuse to believe in God their Lord, and that His Supreme Word may be made manifest unto them, that they may be God-fearing?Say: God prevaileth over all things, and all stand firm by His command. Say: God is the Subduer over all things, and all are fearful of His might. Say: God is manifest over all things, and all stand in awe of His sovereignty. Say: He is the Subduer over you before you, and manifest behind you, and supreme over you from your left, and exalted above your heads, and elevated beneath your feet, and inaccessible from every quarter, that He may transform you by night and by day through His command. His is the Creation and the Command, from before and after. There is no God but He, the Most High, the Most Great.

One, Single, Eternal, Peerless, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Most Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in Thy creation, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou created all things and ordained them according to Thy decree, and by Thy will hast Thou formed all things and shaped them according to Thy wisdom. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for the manifestations of Thy Cause, the dawning-places of Thy bounty, the signs of Thy transcendent glory, and the evidences of Thy supreme majesty. Thou hast ever been the Subduer of the mighty, the Manifestor of power, the Ordainer of destiny, the Sovereign of sovereigns, the Vanquisher of the valiant, the Almighty over the proud, and the Compeller of all things. Thou hast ever been One, Single, Eternal, Peerless, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Most Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son.Thou hast ever been, O my God, the Creator of all things and their Sustainer, the One Who giveth death to all things and Who quickeneth them. Thou hast ever been established over every soul and witness unto all things. None save Thee can reckon the dwellers of the heaven of Thy Lordship, and none but Thee can witness the evidences of the earth of Thy unity. Thou didst begin this creation with the Primal Unity, then didst Thou begin the numbers of Unity with the Primal Unity, then didst Thou multiply the numbers with the first numbers. Glorified art Thou! All who have been illumined by the Sun of Thy oneness and the lights of the manifestation of Thy Countenance - Thou art the One Who existed before all things, the Hidden One of all things, the One Who was before all things, and the One Who shall be after all things.Sanctified be Thy names and exalted be Thy likenesses. Thou hast ever been the Possessor of sovereignty and dominion, the Lord of kingdom and kingship, the Source of might and power, the Fountainhead of bounty and grace, the Origin of glory and loving-kindness. Glorified, exalted, and sanctified be all Thy names, elevated be all Thy examples, uplifted be all Thy signs, and magnified be all Thy tokens in whatsoever they contain and whereon they rest.Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Therefore, O my God, by Thy transcendent glory, Thy supreme majesty, the loftiness of Thy station, and the inviolability of Thy sanctity, do Thou cause to be manifested on the Day of Resurrection, in such manner as Thou lovest and art pleased with, the essence of Thy transcendence, the reality of Thy supreme majesty, the identity of Thy exaltation, the being of Thy sanctity, and the substance of Thy glory. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Inaccessible, the Impregnable; verily, Thou art the Munificent, the Exalted, the Most High; verily, Thou art the Generous, the Almighty, the Powerful; verily, Thou art the Most Kind, the All-Subduing, the Most Potent; verily, Thou art the Most Gracious, the Most Exalted, the Most High.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things and hath ascended in His elevation above all existing things \[...\]

Praise be unto Him Who hath been exalted by His exaltation above all created things, become inaccessible through His inaccessibility above all beings, become manifest through His manifestation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, come into being through His coming into being above all similitudes and allusions, and become enriched through His enrichment above all that exists in the kingdoms of might and signs. He and all His creation bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most High.He hath chosen His pure Essence, His absolute detachment, His pristine camphor-like quality, His pure simplicity, and His lofty detachment for the station of His manifestation, and made it stand at the level of the revelations of His might and education. Then He chose for it beloved names and immersed it in the shoreless ocean of eternity, whereupon the heavens and earth and all that lies between them were filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most High.The recognition of His unity is bound to the recognition of His Gate, and the recognition of His Gate is bound to the recognition of the Primary Sources from His Proof, and the recognition of the Primary Sources from His Proof is bound to the recognition of what hath been revealed in the Bayan concerning the paths of all things. He hath appointed over this trustworthy witnesses, preserving guides, and chosen friends, and taught them what hath been revealed from His presence through what He cast upon them in His verses until the Day of His Manifestation.O witnesses of the Bayan! Be ye ashamed before God Who created you, sustained you, causeth you to die, and giveth you life, that on the Day of Resurrection ye judge not Him Whom God shall make manifest. That covenant was taken from you in the Qur'an, yet ye followed it not and fulfilled it not, until ye passed judgment upon the number of M in A against Him Who created you, sustained you, and gave you life by His command aforetime in the Qur'an. Thus are ye tested on the Day of God's Manifestation, would ye but understand. Had ye understood the proof of your religion, ye would not have judged your Lord God.Lo, We showed you Our verses in the First Book and caused you to hear all that was in all the Tablets, but ye paid no heed and were not among those who perceive in their religion. Otherwise, as ye professed belief aforetime in the Qur'an, ye would believe thereafter in the Bayan, since all revelation is from God, the Supreme, the Exalted.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most High, the Most High. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most High, the Most High. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whosoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One.And furthermore, I testify that simplicity is among the eternal, inaccessible attributes, like loftiness, and this is among the attributes of God, exalted be His glory, and among the examples of God, mighty be His might. If thou attainest unto the Day of Resurrection, then he who is clothed in the garment of simplicity is none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, and he who is adorned with the robe of loftiness is none other than Him. That which can appear from the Unseen of Eternity in mention of the First One hath ever been and shall ever be that which appeareth from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Beyond God there is no end, and besides God there is no limit.

And there is no end besides God, and this is a veil between what descends from God unto all things and what ascends unto Him. Verily the path for creation other than this is blocked, and the way for the servants other than this is barred. Hold fast unto it, for this is a path of truth which We uphold by permission, and all through God's command do believe in it. And it has four stages, the first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Guaranteeing, the Most Guaranteeing. There is no God but He, the Most Guaranteeing, the Most Guaranteeing. Say: God is the Most Guaranteeing above all who possess guarantee. None can withhold himself from the Sovereign King of His guarantee, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lies between them. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Guarantor, the Guarantee-giver, the Guaranteeing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all things in the heavens and on the earth and what lies between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and a King Who passeth not away, and a Just One Who wrongeth not, and a Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lies between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God doth guarantee for you in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them through His grace - will ye not then be thankful? If ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, He will assuredly cause you to enter Paradise - a promise binding upon Him in all the Books of Heaven. And who is more truthful in utterance than God, if ye be of them that are certain? Therefore shall ye guarantee for one another in all circumstances of grief, for verily ye shall receive two thousand times the recompense and attain unto oneness. Whoso guaranteeth for another with his own self or with anything, God will guarantee Paradise for him and the most glorious chambers - ye shall attain unto this bounty. Be not veiled from this bounty, for ye shall surely attain unto it. Therefore watch over your souls on the Day of Resurrection lest ye seek guarantee from Him Whom God shall make manifest while ye work for Him night and day, even as your hands have wrought in the Bayan while ye all work night and day. And should this occur, then hasten ye therein and guarantee more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye. For verily this is from God's command in the Book - ye shall surely understand it, though ye know not Him Whom God shall make manifest.

But you do not know Him Whom God shall make manifest. And if you should stand surety for anyone in their time of sorrow, perchance you may attain unto His presence. This is from God's grace unto all things, whereby He Whom God shall make manifest may dwell therein, all abiding beneath the shadow of His remembrance and all circling round about Him by night and by day. Seek not surety from anyone once you have recognized Him, and if you do seek it, then stand surety for Him in truth and follow God's command. If you seek not surety, it is better for you in God's Book. But since you know not one another, perchance you seek a guarantee for one who knows Him, that he may stand surety for a matter in God's Book until the day when you shall be raised up unto your Lord. For unto God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Supreme Surety, the Guarantor, the Trustee. And unto God belongs the riches of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God has power over all things.Say: God indeed loves that in the Bayan you should all be as one soul, that perchance you may attain unto every bounty ordained by God. Say: You were all created from one soul; will you not then see? We created you from the Point of the Bayan by Our command "Be!" and it was. Therefore watch over one another and set right all your affairs. Should you find among you one who is sorrowful, remove his sorrow to the extent of your power. Should you find among you one who is poor, enrich him to the extent of your ability. Should you find among you one who is abased, exalt him to the extent of your power. Should you find among you one who is veiled, teach him to the extent of your ability. Should you find among you one who is single, arrange for him what God has ordained in the Book to the extent of your power. Should you find among you one who is ill, heal him to the extent of your power. Should you find among you one who has a complaint, comfort him to the extent of your power. May God grant you the essence of the matter: acquire for others what you would acquire for yourselves. For you are all, every one of you, from a single tree, and until the Day of Resurrection you shall in truth bear witness that you are one from another. Look not upon others except as you look upon yourselves, that perchance in the Bayan you may live as brothers in your inmost hearts, and delight as brothers upon your thrones. This is from God's grace upon you all, O all things, that you may arise at God's command. And should you find among you one who lacks sustenance, provide for him in truth, in such wise that no sorrow may descend upon his heart, to the extent of your power. And should you find among you one who lacks clothing, bestow it upon him gloriously to the extent of your power. Look not unto yourselves and your possessions, but look unto God Who created you and gave you of His dominion what He ordained for you, that you may walk in the ways of His good-pleasure. And should you find among you one who, while traveling, lacks the means for sustenance or transport \[...\]

O ye who find among you those who travel but possess not the means of sustenance or transport, while ye have the ability to assist: ye must needs aid them with dignity and honor, for verily ye shall be tested in your days to come. God may descend upon you when ye know not. This is the day when He Whom God shall make manifest will appear amongst you - He Whom God hath associated with His own Self, that ye might exalt Him. Consider those who were given a portion of Our dominion - they offered neither steed nor precious gem in the path of their Lord. Such is the measure of your faith, though ye prostrate yourselves before Us night and day. We have seized you and all that ye possess and cast you into the fire, wherein ye shall find neither protector nor helper.Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou wilt not cause even an atom's weight of sorrow to touch Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Thou hast power over all things. And shouldst Thou bestow aught upon Him, Thou wilt surely take vengeance on his behalf. Therefore, O God, make haste in this and in Thy retribution, for verily Thou hast power over all things. Let not Him Whom Thou hast chosen for Thyself from among all worlds be grieved on the Day of Resurrection, and let His heart be gladdened by that which Thou hast ordained for Him. Verily, Thou art the Best of ordainers.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Secure, the Most SecureGlory be to Thee, O God, my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, and there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Sovereignty, Thine the Majesty and the Glory, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Loftiness and the Grandeur, Thine the Similitudes and Examples, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Strength and Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Power, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. All hath ever been within Thy grasp, and verily He Whom Thou shalt make manifest is invested with all things through His own Self, for Thy sovereignty over all things maketh Him their possessor, and Thy dominion over all things giveth Him power over them.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, self-sufficient, sovereign, all-pervading, holy, everlasting, sempiternal, dependent on none. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hath there been any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. All worship Thee according to the paths Thou hast established for them, and all prostrate themselves before Thee in accordance with the purposes Thou hast raised up for them. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Who can flee from Thy dominion or resist Thy will? Who can escape Thy grasp or be veiled from Thy Purpose? Nay, by Thy might! Thy sovereignty is manifest throughout all created things.

By Thy glory! Thy sovereignty is manifest over all created things, and Thy will is supreme over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thy dominion shines forth upon all beings, and Thy all-encompassing power envelops all who inhabit the realms of earth and heaven. Thy grace is established over all atoms, and Thy self-sufficiency is proven to all who dwell in the kingdom of names and attributes. All that exists in the atmosphere of Thy heaven and earth prostrates before Thee, and all that dwells in the kingdom of Thy command and creation worships Thee. Everything, in its essence, causes lightning to flash when glorifying Thee, and lightning appears when sanctifying Thee. Water descends when declaring Thy unity, and snow fills the air and earth when proclaiming Thy greatness. Glorified and exalted art Thou! All Thy servants, all who bow before Thee, all who are content with Thee, all who remember Thee, all who thank Thee, and all who praise Thee. Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then to die and to live. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest through Thy command. Verily, Thou hast power over all things. The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Secure, the Most Secure. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all beings, Who hath empowered Himself in His power above all things, and Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is none other God but Him, the Single One, the Guarantor. He hath appeared through the manifestations of His security for the dawning-places of His sanctification as He willeth, through what He willeth. His is the praise! He hath blazed forth and risen up, hath shone and become inaccessible, hath appeared and manifested Himself, hath illumined and become illumined, hath flashed and become resplendent, hath risen and become exalted - praise that filleth the heavens with the sublimity of His sanctification, and the earth with the transcendence of His glorification, and what lieth between them with the manifestations of His mighty security. He hath chosen an impenetrable essence, a glorious abstraction, an eternal reality, a pure primordial nature, and a divine archetype. He hath revealed Himself to it through it, and cast into its reality the example of what He loveth from His presence. Thus there appeared from it the evidences of His might and power, the signs of His holiness and sanctity, the manifestations of His glory and majesty, the appearances of His light and radiance, and the revelations of His grace and bounty. Therefore He thanketh Himself with such thanks as none of His creation hath seen, and praiseth Himself with such praise as none of His servants hath offered, for what He hath ordained of His security and approved for His equals - praise that nothing can equal, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and thanks that nothing can resemble, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and thanks that nothing can resemble in the kingdom of the Command \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Secure, the Most Secure!Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Secure, the Most Secure. And verily all glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One, wherein naught can be seen except that First One.And now, I testify, O Thou Most Exalted Name and Most Resplendent Symbol, that God, glorified be He, hath created fire and light, and hath ordained for each of them its effect within its own limit. When thou attainest unto the days of the Manifestation of God, be thou for Him and among those who prove His truth, for through proving His truth is proven the unity of thy Lord and the glorification of thy Creator. Let not that which proceedeth from negation weaken thee, for it hath no permanence - weaker than denial and more fragile than a spider's web. For when thou sayest "except the sun of heaven" there existeth no sun to oppose it; likewise when thou sayest "there is no god but God" there existeth no god besides God, and there is none before Him to oppose Him. And verily what thou seest of the conditions of negation are but weaker than this and more feeble than that.I counsel thee with two counsels - if thou holdest fast to them, thou shalt triumph in thy Cause and prevail over whomsoever thou willest within thy dominion. First: be steadfast in manifesting thy affirmation and let not the negation of the deniers weaken thee, for it itself confirmeth thy affirmation. Second: verily that knowledge causeth all things to flow through their proper channels. Observe how the followers of the Gospel, through the means at their disposal, have triumphed in their cause, though without doubt they are not following the good-pleasure of God. And thou who art in the station of truth hast no path except to raise up the Cause of God through its proper means. If thou wouldst be like those who are not of thy Faith in employing the means, thou shalt triumph in thy Cause. Verily both truth and falsehood move through the means of that Kingdom, except that truth is true in its movement while falsehood deserveth naught and its movement is without right. Hold fast to these two counsels and look not to imaginary hidden matters, for the Cause is manifest and the decree is evident.God hath guided thee to the paths of truth in the Bayan - hold fast unto it, for all are upheld by God's command. And it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Commanding, the Most Commanding! Say: God commandeth above every possessor of command. None can withhold himself from the dominion of the Sovereign of his destiny, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the All-Commanding, the Commander, the Most Commanding. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: all are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: all are devoted to Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him, His is the sovereignty \[...\]

Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him and whatsoever lieth between them. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and no thing in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape His grasp. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Best-Beloved. Say: Verily God commandeth whatsoever He willeth by His command "Be!" and it is. Say: God doeth what He willeth by His command. He shall not be asked of His doings, but all shall be asked of all things. Say: The Balance of Truth is the Command of God - ye are upholding the Command of God. O Ahmad! We have indeed sent thee aforetime from Our presence as a guidance and glad-tidings to the God-fearing, and We have given thee a Command from Our presence - verily We have been commanding. And We have bestowed upon thee the gates which We have sent down in the Bayan as a grace from Our presence - verily We have been bountiful - that thou mayest convey unto all things the Command of thy Lord and be of them that bear witness concerning those who enter into the Faith of God. Observe thou those who imagine of themselves that they judge by authority from their Imams, how they manifest the Cause of God while they are behind three veils, attributing themselves unto God untruthfully, then commanding untruthfully. But thou art without any veil from God and in thy hands is the Book of thy Lord - how thou dost manifest the Cause of thy Lord throughout all worlds! Grieve not for those who are veiled from the path of their Lord, for they worship God according to what was revealed aforetime. And thou shalt convey unto those who desire to enter into the Faith of God, for this is of the fruits of Paradise for the God-fearing. Upon everyone who followeth the Command of his Lord are spirit and fragrance from God in an impregnable Book, and upon him who followeth not is fire from God after thy Lord's proof hath been completed against him. O all things! Ye await the Command of God. Say: Consider what was revealed unto Us aforetime, then afterwards, as a wondrous and impregnable remembrance. And verily what thou witnesseth in the Other Book - that is truth from God wherein there is no doubt. There hath never been any God besides God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glory be unto Him and exalted is He above what they mention. Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glory be unto Him and exalted is He above what they utter. Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glory be unto Him and exalted is He above what they speak. Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glory be unto Him \[...\]

Exalted is He above what they say! Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glorified and exalted is He above what they attribute! Say: Is there any god besides God? Say: Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe! Say: All act by God and then by His command. Say: All are assured by God and then by His command. Say: All are strengthened by God and then by His command. Say: All glory in God and then in His command. Say: All are elevated by God and then by His command. Say: All are empowered by God and then by His command. And verily We have given thee what was aforementioned in the Book, and We were indeed cognizant of all things. Soon shall We bestow upon thee what thou lovest from God; verily We were thy Protector. Let none grieve thee in the path of God, and exalt the Cause of God amongst all the worlds. And what thou hast mentioned concerning the affirmation of exalted glory, We have accepted it as a remembrance from Our presence, for We were indeed mindful. Therefore praise be to God, before and after, then in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, for We were thankful. And unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, then before and after, for We were bountiful. Say: Who is able to describe God, thy Lord? All are His servants and all worship Him. Say: Who is able to characterize God, thy Lord? All prostrate before Him. Say: Who is able to praise God, thy Lord? All were created by His command and all worship Him. Say: Verily God, my Lord, will bless me and those who have believed in God and His signs, and those who place their trust in God their Lord. Say: We all belong to God and unto Him shall we all return. Say: We all belong to God and in God, our Lord, the All-Merciful, do we place our trust. We have given thee the essence of knowledge in the Cause that people might be guided thereby. The essence of the Cause is affirmation, then the essence of negation is prohibition - thus do ye reason and thus shall ye know. We have elevated in the Bayan that which ye detest and that which ye mention of names - but do ye understand the mystery of this, or are ye not among those who know? On the Day of Resurrection, it is incumbent upon Us that everything reach its highest ordained station. We have caused affirmation to enter an exalted Paradise, and the tradition is a degree before the Cause which We have elevated to the Cause, for We were capable of all things. And We have caused negation to enter the Fire, and what is detested is a degree beneath negation which We have caused to enter the Fire. Thus doth God cause all things on the Day of Resurrection to attain what He hath ordained for them, for He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Therefore thou seest naught in existence save "There is no god but God." If ye seek shelter in the shadow of negation, ye shall enter the Fire - this is what God hath forbidden you. Ye witness all the aspects of negation in the shadow of this. And if ye seek shelter in the shadow of affirmation, ye shall enter the Most Great Paradise. Ye witness all the aspects of the Cause in the shadow of this.

And if ye abide beneath the shade of steadfastness, ye shall enter into the Most Great Paradise. In all affairs ye behold them beneath this shadow, yet on the Day of Resurrection ye shall believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. This indeed is the greatest command given unto you, unlike that which ye were wont to utter in the Qur'an. In this Cause ye amass what the camel can bear, while remaining veiled from that which God hath commanded you. God hath forbidden nothing more strongly than that ye should fail to follow Him Who believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Draw not nigh unto that which God hath forbidden. Say: All that giveth joy to Him Whom God shall make manifest - that is the command of God in the Bayan and in the heavenly Books before it - ye shall follow it. And all that grieveth Him Whom God shall make manifest - from this ye shall guard yourselves in the Bayan and in all the heavenly Books. Say: Commands have their gradations, and prohibitions have their gradations - ye shall comprehend each within its bounds. He hath commanded you to perform pilgrimage to the House and to the House of the Point - this is command upon command, and ye shall follow what God hath commanded you. Then God hath permitted you the dwellings of the Living One, and what hath been ordained for you like unto the Point - these are among the gradations of His command, and ye shall understand each command within its bounds. All this is after ye have the means and glory to accomplish it; otherwise God hath exempted you, except regarding the House and the House of the Point, for ye are believers in God for God's sake, and are assured of the Primal Point for the sake of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then the Manifestations of the Living One have appeared by God's command from the Primal Point - such are your paths in the Bayan, and ye are assured of God's command. And verily We shall grant you comprehensive understanding of the Cause from Our presence, that ye may magnify God's command. We have indeed commanded everything, and from this ye shall draw evidence in every matter. Likewise have We forbidden, and ye shall behold the sublimity of the command. Set no bounds to God's command, for His mercy hath encompassed all that is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. In all things ye shall look to God's command, not to what deriveth from His creation, if ye desire salvation on the Day of Resurrection. At every Manifestation ye shall await God's command, for the command of a previous Manifestation may become forbidden, and what was forbidden may become commanded. God doeth what He willeth. He shall not be asked of His doings, but all shall be asked of all things. Perchance on the Day of Truth's appearance ye follow what ye were commanded, while God's prohibition is within you and ye remember it not. And perchance ye remain veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest and from what ye are forbidden by Him, paying no heed to it - this is what God had forbidden you aforetime in the Qur'an. Ye shall take God's command in its essence. This is the word of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all else is created by God's command from His presence. Observe then how in Islam all were created by God's command from Muhammad's presence, according to their stations with their Lord, the Ancient of Days.

All things beside Him are created by the Command of God proceeding from Him. Consider in Islam how all were created at their stations by God's Command from Muhammad - the first and the last, the outward and the inward, even the clay in the Sacred House, the Stone in the Corner and the Station - all were created by God's Command from Muhammad, and all are guides to His Cause, if ye be of those who testify to the truth. And verily your taking the Black Stone as witness of your faith in God and His signs, while keeping distant from the gates of negation, shall profit you not except if on the Day of Resurrection ye testify to that which ye have witnessed. How many servants have declared themselves free from the gates of fire while they themselves sought the Stone's witness to their faith in God and His signs, yet believed not in the Primal Point nor in what God revealed unto Him - how then can they believe in what God revealed aforetime?O people of the Bayan! Your following God's Cause shall profit you not except if ye follow Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is the Path of God if ye wish to be saved. O people of the Bayan! When ye behold in Him two matters, ye all witness each at its station, and likewise their shadows. Say not this is inferior to that, or this opposes that, for We desire not that anyone should differ concerning God's Command and prohibition, as all were upon guidance and the path of certain truth. Say not this is our opinion, for this is beneath what God hath created in the Book, as ye know not. Rather say this is God's Command and we have naught save by God's leave; in Him do we trust and in God let the believers place their trust.We commanded you not to apply your men's knowledge to Our words, for this shall profit you not. Take ye the Book of God in truth and hear ye from the Tongue of God in truth, and preserve in truth all that hath been revealed from Our presence, for this is your provision until the Day of Resurrection whereon all on earth shall stand. Should the Sun be hidden, ye shall see naught of God's Command except that ye judge by what ye have heard or what is in the Book. Whoso altereth a single letter is not permitted, and whoso changeth a command hath no power, save those who desire to sit upon the seat of truth, for they have been given leave in that, not in what God hath permitted of the laws of the Bayan and its ordinances and its gifts.O ye rulers! Follow naught but God's Command. Behold ye God's Command, that perchance like the Day of Resurrection, God may command what He seeth best for you. Ye observe the loftiness of the Cause and strive for the exaltation of God's remembrance, but this shall profit you not except if ye strive for the exaltation of His remembrance Whom God shall make manifest and the invincibility of His Cause. For this is God's Command before and after, which ye await. For by your saying "yea" all that is yours shall be made right \[...\]

And you anticipate this afterwards: if you say "yea," all that you possess and all that is against you shall be made right, and you shall enter Paradise; but by your silence or by saying "nay," all that you possess and all that is against you shall be rendered void, and you shall enter the fire. This is your own selves - God hath created no fire greater than you, if you would but guard against your own selves. And God hath created no paradise greater than those who follow Him Whom God shall make manifest, for they in their own souls are assured from their Lord. Therefore watch ye for the Cause of God in every Dispensation, for by this shall ye be tested. Perchance ye cling to the Cause of God from before, while ye remain veiled from His good-pleasure and His Cause anew. Worship ye God as He wisheth to be worshipped, and follow ye the Cause of God as He wisheth it to be followed. For otherwise your example is like one who worshippeth God and followeth His Cause according to what was revealed before, yet remaineth veiled from what is revealed afterwards, and for this reason becometh a negation, if ye would but remember. Therefore consider by whom is the Command a command - is it by other than the verses of God, if ye be of those who were before the Point of the Bayan and those who shall be before Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye would but reflect. Look ye unto the proof of your religion, then after that look ye unto command and negation. And look ye unto the proof of Him Whom God shall make manifest - if ye are powerless before His verses, then at that moment ye follow God's Cause anew and guard against His prohibition anew. And verily this hath been completed by thy Lord's command. Return ye to the remembrance of the name of thy Lord that ye may write what is revealed from God, for this is the great attainment. And say to those who believe in God and His verses: all shall appear according to that for which they were created. Let not negation weaken you while ye remain firm in your affirmation, and be not veiled from the Cause of God, for God shall surely recompense as He willeth through what He hath created of means. Do ye not observe the nations upon the earth, how they possess what they possess of means? Yet they possess without right, while those who follow God's Cause with truth exalt the Cause of God, then through the means God hath created they come to possess what ye ask of His bounty. Know ye the value of the Days of Resurrection, for the sun hath never risen upon days like these, around which all other days and nights revolve. These are days wherein God hath made Himself known - ye were unable to know Him before. These are days wherein God hath lifted the veil from His countenance - ye are unable to comprehend this afterwards. Though ye cry out in your nights and days, and traverse the East and West of the earth, ye shall find no path to the Sun of Truth except that ye be commanded by the true witnesses in the Bayan. We have made thee a witness unto what thou hast borne of Our Cause and what was revealed in the Bayan - this is from God's bounty unto thee until the Day when all shall return unto Him. Therefore observe those who pride themselves on vain authorizations from those who have no right to judge.

Whatsoever hath been revealed in the Bayan is a bounty from God bestowed upon thee until the Day when all shall return unto Him. Behold those who pride themselves on vain credentials from such as have no right to judge, while this is a Book from God wherein there is no doubt, a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. Follow none but Him and fix thy gaze on naught except Him, for this is the path of truth made certain. Not one among you who hath witnessed the Bayan but possesseth all that We have revealed, be it but a dot or a letter. This is God's command, if ye be of them that testify to the truth. It is not permissible for you save that ye write words with the utmost excellence within your power. Waste not your books with marginal scribblings, but make all your books as light as ye are able. For all that was revealed in the Bayan is a delicate leaf to be delivered to Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye be of them that truly deliver. This is God's trust in your hands, that ye may convey it to Him Whom God shall make manifest and follow what He commandeth you from God. Know ye the worth of these verses, for they are like unto the days of Muhammad aforetime. Were My revelation to cease henceforth, ye would find no way to reach Him. All were created for the meeting with thy Lord - how precious is this on the Day of Resurrection, if ye but witness it! God created not the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, nor any thing, save for meeting with Me. Ye have confined Me to a single cord while supposing yourselves to act with sincerity. Nay, nay! Ye remain veiled from the very cause of your existence. How much more from His commands which are but parts of the knowledge of your Lord and the exaltation of His Word! Why do ye not recognize the Days of God? Do ye not consider those who have ascended unto God their Lord, each of whom regarded all that is on earth as but a weightless trifle? Ye are more precious than these and more penetrating in knowledge, so why do ye not reflect upon your own creation? Their glory lay in what they attained from their Lord, making themselves words for the exaltation of their Creator's Cause - and ye were all created for this, yet ye remain veiled from what God intended for you, supposing ye do good. This is a Day wherein ye supplicate Him in the number of the years. No command is more precious than this with God or with them who are endowed with knowledge. Were they who await Me to recognize Me, they would fall prostrate like unto you. Vaunt not yourselves, for We have lifted your veil and beheld you truly in what ye truly believe. This is of God's bounty and mercy unto you, that ye might be thankful. We desired not to unveil others, yet were We to will it, We would unveil them, whereupon all would fall prostrate before Us. Know ye therefore the worth of your days and trifle not with them, as ye slumber, heedless of the loftiness of God's Cause.

And do not trifle with it while ye slumber, unmindful of the loftiness of God's Cause, and remain veiled from the exaltation of God's Word. Let not those who are veiled from your Lord's Cause dishearten you. For verily, those who negate were created for the fire, and they proclaim this by their own selves. And verily those who affirm, having been created for paradise, appear as guides to truth through truth. How do these ones wrongfully proclaim their negation through their means, while ye, after God hath brought you clear signs and permitted you what He hath created by His command to affirm your Lord, neither rise up nor make proclamation? Therefore, ye shall manifest your truth and cause to perish those who uphold not your truth. For verily, affirmation is not established save through the negation of negation. Ye are all in "There is no God but God." If ye cause not to perish those who believe not in God, ye cannot establish those who do believe in God. These are the companions of the fire, and those are the companions of paradise - both are in God's grasp and prostrate themselves before Him by night and by day. These by God's command in the previous Manifestation, and those by God's command in the subsequent Manifestation - and all prostrate themselves before Him. I shall assuredly inform thee of the key to the Cause in the Bayan, that thou mayest testify that there is no God but I, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. All the Command is for the exaltation of the Primal Point, and all that ye are commanded are aspects thereof. And all the prohibitions from which ye are forbidden constitute the extinction of negation in the presence of affirmation. Ye perceive by God's command the mystery of all things. Otherwise, it would be equal unto God thy Lord whether His house be the Holy House, or the temple of Jesus, or the Sacred House, or the House of Inaccessibility - all are in His grasp and all prostrate before Him. However, in every Dispensation God exalteth the mention of His Proof by His command. At this time ye are exalted through the Inaccessible, whereas formerly ye were glorified through the Sacred House, and before that through what was ordained by God. O all things! Ye shall all depart from every Dispensation save the Bayan, then enter truthfully into the Bayan. Then on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye shall enter into each of His Manifestations, then depart from every Manifestation. This is God's command hereafter as it was before. We have neglected nothing in the Book, but have detailed all things in detail, and there is nothing wherein We have not clarified Our command and prohibition that ye behold in the Bayan. And if ye differ regarding a matter and find testimony for both sides in verses, ye shall act according to the latter, and if ye know not, then learn through one of them whereby God's Cause is exalted, then be patient regarding the other. This is your balance from your Lord. God desireth naught but to make His religion spacious for you, to cause you to enter into His mercy, and to show you what He hath ordained for you from His presence. Verily, there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Soon shall We detail the measures of all things in the Bayan, and We shall answer what thou hast mentioned in the Book. Verily, We were aforetime, and shall ever be, the Answerers.

Let Us answer what thou hast mentioned in the Book. Verily, We were aforetime, and shall forever remain, the Answerer. That which ye were commanded in your religion aforetime, that ye should seek knowledge even if ye should journey unto China - this knowledge was for the good pleasure of your Lord, not what ye yourselves would fabricate. Consider then in your piety how ye strove aforetime to fulfill the commandments of your religion, that ye might discover the knowledge of God's good pleasure in Our Cause. Yet when the repository of His good pleasure was made manifest unto you, and verses were sent down so clear that all stand powerless before them - verses by which your former religion was established - ye cavil against God and are not ashamed. Ye reckon among yourselves that ye do good, yet ye harm none but yourselves, for verily We are independent of all things. If ye turn unto God and believe in all that was revealed in the Bayan, then shall ye be numbered among the believers; otherwise ye shall be like those who came before you, who have no worth before God. Fear ye then the day of your return, and remember the day of your beginning, for within Our grasp lie both your first and your last, and We have power over you.Deliver thou this Book unto the leaders who hold themselves back, claiming they are learned, that they might return unto themselves on the Day of Resurrection and enter into the Faith. We shall teach thee five proofs, each a conclusive argument sufficient for all who seek evidence. Say: The first is that God proved His Cause in the Qur'an through verses alone, and ye are powerless before these verses just as they were. The second is that the verses of God suffice you beyond all ye desire, as ye have read aforetime in the Qur'an in the Surih of the Spider, if ye be of those who are certain of the Book and what God hath testified. The third is that these verses are greater than limited verses and what was revealed aforetime unto the Prophets, though ye love not to admit it. For were the verses of the Qur'an not greater, God would not have abrogated through them what was revealed before unto the Prophets before Muhammad. Why do ye not then understand the greatness of God's Cause, nor ponder His verses? The fourth is that ye have no proof in your religion today save the Qur'an whereby God established the Cause of Muhammad aforetime. How then do ye not follow on the Latter Day what ye followed before? Ye have no way to judge the Qur'an save that when ye see a verse ye say: "This is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting," for ye have read that none but God can reveal verses. So when ye see or hear them, by your own religion it is established that ye should say "This is from God" and thereby believe and be certain. The fifth is an elevated rational proof: if one desired to enter the religion of Islam, could ye prove it by aught besides the Qur'an? If ye say yea, ye have naught else, nor would one who wished to enter your religion hear from you aught else, as your successive transmission after knowledge thereof establishes it for you\[...\]

And none shall hear from you who desires to enter your religion, for after your knowledge of him, neither you nor those who wish to enter can prove it. And there is no evidence in what you say to complete God's proof against those who did not enter Islam through the Qur'an; God's proof is completed against those who did not enter the Bayan. And there is no way for you in your religion except that you say those who did not enter Islam, God's proof was completed against them and they wrongfully did not enter. Likewise those given knowledge of the Bayan say regarding those who do not enter it. Say: If one were to ask Me about what was revealed while you were preserving it - indeed if We wish, We would recite the like of what was revealed, and would not preserve a letter of what I recited before, for I was not of the preservers. For one preserves verses to derive proof from them, while We, if We wish, can reveal at any time. Similarly, We revealed before what We had not preserved, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall, as We wish, reveal unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, though He will not be among those who preserved what God revealed before, as He recites as He wishes from God. What is wrong with you that you do not remember and do not understand? Can the light of the sun be separated from its rays? Likewise, God's verses cannot be separated from the Primal Point. Indeed, if We wish, We could reveal four thousand verses day and night - who could do that if you would but reflect a little within yourselves? And God created you and what you do. Soon you shall enter the Bayan and remember the days of the Point, then you shall be humbled. And soon the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest shall overtake you, and if you do not recognize Him as you failed to recognize Me, then you are truthful in your humility; otherwise God shall take vengeance upon you. And what vengeance equals this proof of your Lord while you, who were created by God's command from the previous Manifestation, dwell in the glory of your seats? Nay, by that Book which is truth, no vengeance equals this. You were all created for the meeting with God, and you all strive to earn God's good pleasure in your lives. Yet you have created a barrier between yourselves and the meeting with God through what your hands have wrought, and between yourselves and God's good pleasure through what you have patiently endured while being unaware. We show you only the likeness of a tree burning in fire, crying for help therein, and We answer you, but you do not hear God's word. Likewise on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, you consider yourselves pious in the Bayan, but with God no one loves to mention you. So fear God, then fear Him. Say: Exalted is the Possessor of dominion and kingdom, exalted is the Possessor of might and power, exalted is God the Possessor of strength and divinity, exalted is God the Possessor of force and glory, exalted is God the Possessor of sovereignty.

Exalted is God, Lord of sovereignty and the human realm! Exalted is God, Lord of might and glory! Exalted is He, Lord of countenance and beauty! Exalted is God, Lord of visage and perfection! Exalted is God, Lord of power and action! Exalted is God, Lord of mercy and grace! Exalted is God, Lord of dominion and justice! Exalted is God, Lord of likeness and similitudes! Exalted is God, Lord of stations and majesty! Exalted is God, Lord of grandeur and independence! Exalted is God, Lord of glory and radiance! Exalted is God, Lord of might and inaccessibility! Exalted is God, Lord of power and transcendence! Exalted is God, Lord of joy and gladness! Exalted is God, Lord of sovereignty and power!Exalted is God above all that they attribute unto Him, before and after! All that is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them glorify Him, and all that is in the kingdom of command and creation and whatsoever is beneath them bow down before Him. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Guard thyself in the path and write not unto those whom thou desirest to guide save that which will profit them from the verses, for this is of God's grace unto thee and unto the God-fearing. And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme! There is none other God but He, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme! Say: God is supreme above every possessor of supremacy. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can resist the power of His sovereign supremacy. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath been supreme in His supremacy.Glorified be He before Whom boweth down whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be unto God, Whom doth glorify whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but He. His is the kingdom and the dominion, then might and power, then strength and divinity, then force and sovereignty, then dominion and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or in the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is powerful over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Verily, We shall cause the supreme one to refrain from following his own self, and We shall command the supreme one to follow thy self. We are witness unto this. Say: Do ye recognize the Command and then the Supreme One, or do ye not recognize them? Say: The Manifestations of the Command are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and who desire His good-pleasure.

And We verily command those who forbid to follow thy self, for We have been witness thereto. Say: Do ye recognize command and prohibition, or do ye not recognize? Say: The exponents of command are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and seek His good pleasure, while the exponents of prohibition are they who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest and yet seek His good pleasure. These are servants in the Bayan who follow all the limits revealed therein, but inasmuch as they have not worshipped God through their following of Him Whom God shall make manifest, these are the exponents of prohibition in the sight of God. Draw not nigh unto them, and guard yourselves against them. O ye who forbid! Guard yourselves against your own selves. Verily the exponents of command are servants who observe what is revealed in the Bayan and who in their inmost hearts are assured, believing in Him Whom God shall make manifest, burning away all veils, seeking the good pleasure of God from the Manifestation of His Self. These are the dawning-places of command - blessed are they and those who beseech God's grace. At this moment ye understand not. Look ye in the Gospel at the exponents of command who believed in Muhammad beforehand, and besides them the exponents of prohibition, though they deemed themselves knowers of God's command in the Gospel. Then after that, look ye in the Qur'an at the exponents of command who believed in 'Ali before Muhammad and who observe the Bayan, and besides them the exponents of prohibition. Ye witness your end in your beginning, that ye may perchance observe both. Say: In the Bayan are the exponents of the letter Ha in speech. Say: Some verses are from God, some from the Primal Point, some from the witnesses of truth, some from the gates of guidance, and some from the witnesses of the Bayan - all these ye witness in their degrees. And some are from the tongue of all things which God hath revealed in truth - ye know all things within their limits. This is the arc of what descendeth and likewise what ascendeth, as ye witness in truth. Say: All this descendeth from a single Tree - God causeth to descend upon it as He pleaseth the exponents of His command and prohibition. Ye gaze toward your Lord. Consider whereby command is established and prohibition is established, that ye may not be veiled by them on the Day of Resurrection. For if God should will, He would make command into prohibition, even as ye now witness. All peoples in the days of their Prophet were following a command from God - how then doth God prohibit you in the later Manifestation from that command? Thus doth God do what He willeth and decree what He desireth. Likewise regarding prohibition - perchance what He forbade you before, He commands you after. Ye gaze toward God's command from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: He Who maketh fire to become light and light to become fire, maketh the lawful unlawful and the unlawful lawful. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: The creation of fire was not except by God's command, and light likewise. And if God should make the Most High Command the seat of this, then their mention would be changed. Ye gaze toward the source of the Command. And the lawful \[...\]

Behold! When God maketh the Most Great Cause to be the seat of this, then are their names transformed as ye gaze upon the beginning of the Cause. Moreover, the lawful and the forbidden are naught but at the bidding of God. Should God transform the Cause and establish this in remembrance of that, then ye shall possess what God hath decreed. If ye but perceive, all your tribulations rest in this. All peoples at the end of their Dispensation cling to what they possess, and all are light in their own religion. But when God manifesteth His Cause, He maketh them as fire, inasmuch as they enter not into the subsequent Revelation. All profess to follow God's command and all claim to worship Him, yet their love hath no divine authority; else would God's proof be made manifest unto all things at every Revelation through truth, but ye remain veiled by your own desires.Say: God is with you, hearing your secrets and your whispers, and We know what ye acquire. Fear ye God after your death, for if ye be believers ye shall assuredly enter Paradise and abide therein eternally. Therein shall ye find of all things that wherein lieth the beauty of all things - ye shall attain this most glorious bounty from God. Say: Were ye to behold the beauty thereof in the essence of love and the Cause, this would spring from the love of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye be sincere in truth. Fear ye God after your death, for if ye be not believers ye shall enter the fire. Have mercy upon your own souls and be God-fearing. But if ye believe in what hath been revealed in the Bayan, ye shall enter Paradise after your death - this hath been promised by God in all the heavenly Books - if on the Day of Resurrection ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest.And if ye comprehend not God's Cause, ye shall enter Paradise after your death and therein shall ye live. And if ye desire your return, then convey your remembrance to Him Whom God shall make manifest, for He will cause you to return among those who are alive upon the earth and are assured of God's Cause. Say: Devise not principles concerning what is commanded and what is forbidden, for this is among the greatest prohibitions of God in the Bayan, if ye be His worshippers. This will but increase your veiling from God, while ye know what God hath commanded you, both outwardly in the Book and inwardly in the verses.Verily We have seen those who were scrupulous in their principles regarding their Lord's commands and prohibitions, yet on the Day of Resurrection they turned not to their Lord with guidance and faith, but grew proud and pronounced judgment without divine authority - a thing none had permission for - and they knew it not. Say: God's prohibition is upon their own selves, and God's command concerning them is that they should efface themselves and obliterate their principles and return unto God in the Bayan, then be assured of God's verses. The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify \[...\]

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and the beauty, Thine the countenance and perfection, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the stations and glory, Thine the power and action, Thine the mercy and grace, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the awe and grandeur, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the providence and manifestation, Thine the might and inaccessibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the grandeur and glory, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been a God unworship'd, a Lord unlord'd, a Known unknown, a Power unpowered, a Hearer unheard. When Thou didst desire to create that creation, Thou didst manifest the Manifestation of Thy Self. Through what was manifest of Thy Divinity in Him appeared the objects of worship, through the revelation of Thy Lordship in Him appeared the objects of lordship, through the manifestation of Thy knowledge in Him appeared the objects of knowledge, through the revelation of Thy power in Him appeared the objects of power, and through the manifestation of Thy hearing in Him appeared the objects of hearing.Thou hast ever been God from all eternity, and Lord that never ceaseth to be, All-Knowing in every state, All-Powerful in all conditions, and Hearer of all that every thing calleth for in the kingdom of beginning and end. Changes alter Thee not, conditions transform Thee not, states shift Thee not, and transitions move Thee not. None in earth or heaven can flee from the kingdom of Thy sovereignty.Therefore, O my God, educate all who are in the Bayan that they may place all things in their proper stations and dwelling-places, that thereby they may ascend and establish their knowledge in the seats of their glory, such that were they to possess but a piece of paper, they should place it in its proper place. For other than this would not be justice from Thee nor grace from Thy presence, as every thing possesseth a spirit connected to its owner. When it hath no beloved station, that thing becometh sorrowful in its owner's presence.Glorified and exalted art Thou, Who hast placed all things in their proper stations and commanded all Thy creation to place each thing in its proper place. How blessed is he whom Thou hast taught this knowledge regarding the stations of his worldly and otherworldly affairs, his highest and his lowest concerns. I have desired this, O my God, for Thy loved ones, and have desired for them inaccessibility in that whereby they educate themselves. Therefore, O my God, rear them unto the heights of inaccessibility and the summit of exaltation in every universal and particular matter, for God placeth naught save in its proper station.

In the name of God, the Most High, the Most High!Praise be to God Who ordaineth naught save in its proper place and revealeth no command except in its befitting station. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Unique, Self-Subsisting, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining, the All-Compelling Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Eternal, the Everlasting, the Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in Thy creation, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Whose dominion passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Potentate Whose power changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The third in the third. In the name of God, the Most High, the Most High! Praise be to God, the Dawning One, the Effulgent, the Illuminating, the Radiant, the Separator, the Companion, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the Truth-Revealing, the Verifier, the Supreme, the Excelling, the Swift, the Foremost, the Exalted, the High, the Joining, the Uniting, the Rending, the Cleaving, the Creating, the Sustaining, the Bountiful, Who hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Single, the Most High. He hath forbidden all His creation from knowing aught but Him and hath commanded all things to know Him. And since none can know Him save through the recognition of the Manifestation of His Revelation and the Dawning-Place of His Concealment, He hath commanded all things to know the Letters of the Seven and hath forbidden recognition of aught else.And since His recognition hath appeared in that kingdom through His primary names, He hath made them the Messengers of the Qur'an to those in the kingdoms of creation and origination. Then He chose from among that creation witnesses of might to establish the knowledge of God and His sanctification, and to forbid the following of desires and whatsoever is not pleasing unto Him. This is the path in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. O all things! Fear ye God, your Lord!The fourth in the fourth. In the name of God, the Most High, the Most High! Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no God, the Most High, the Most High. And verily the glory from God is upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen except the First Unity. And furthermore, I testify that the essence of a thing in its reality is transformed by God's command and prohibition, and that the recognition of God's command cometh after the recognition of His Proof. For when the Proof establisheth his proof, then his command is God's command and his prohibition is God's prohibition. The Command of God appeareth from none save from its repository, and the repository of the Command hath ever been and shall ever be the Tree of Truth, its branches, its leaves, and its fruits. When they command something, that is from the Command, and when they forbid something, that is from the Prohibition \[...\]

And their fruits are that when they command a command, it is from a command, and when they forbid something, it is from a prohibition. And naught is seen therein save God, and these are mirrors that indicate naught but God. So when God commands and forbids otherwise, and thou in every Revelation art tried by the commands of the past and its prohibitions, gain insight into what makes a command a command and a prohibition a prohibition, that perchance on the Day of the Manifestation of Truth thou mayest not be veiled by God's former commands and prohibitions, and mayest be guided by the new commands and prohibitions. For this is what distinguishes the believer from others, else all claim to follow God's command and prohibition, as thou seest throughout the earth. God hath forbidden naught like that which would grieve Him Whom God shall make manifest, and hath commanded naught like that which would gladden Him Whom God shall make manifest. Around these two do the spheres of command and prohibition, and their dawning-places, revolve.O all things! Ye are slain in the presence of the Sun, that perchance ye may reflect its radiance. And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Equitable, the Most Equitable. There is no God but He, the Most Equitable, the Most Equitable. Say: God is more equitable than every possessor of equity. None can escape from the dominion of His equity's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath been equitable, just, and righteous. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are humble before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly judge between you with justice on the Day of Resurrection, but on that Day ye shall not know. Say: All that shall be decreed concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, on this Day of His manifestation, is God's justice in truth, but ye are not content with what God hath decided. Reflect then on what the Point of the Furqan decreed in the days of His manifestation, how those who were given the Gospel did not accept what God had decreed in justice. And reflect on the days of God and what the Point of the Bayan decreed, how those who were given Islam did not believe in what God had decreed in justice through His Proof. Thus shall ye be tried on the Day of Resurrection. Say: If any thing believeth not in Us, God will not decree guidance for it \[...\]

They who have been given Islam reject what the Point of the Bayan hath decreed, and likewise do they reject what God hath decreed in justice through His Proof. Thus shall ye be tested on the Day of Resurrection. Say: Should anything fail to believe in Us, God shall not decree for it guidance or faith, and verily We have been the judge thereof. But they who have veiled themselves from those who have been given Islam shall never be pleased with Us in the name of faith, even though they be pleased with what they have gained, in the manner of their gaining.

And if they believe not in Us, they shall abide forever in the fire. This is God's decree, and this His servants. On the Day of Resurrection, ye shall judge according to God's decree, not according to the decree of His servants, if ye be of them that believe. If ye follow Him Whom God shall make manifest, then are ye believers in God's decree; and if ye follow not the Word of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then are ye followers of the decree of those who follow other than God. Follow not these, but follow Him Whom God shall make manifest from your Lord, for this is the path of certain truth. Say: God judgeth you with good pleasure - this is God's justice in the Book, if ye be of them that are assured of what God decreeth. This Book is from God unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. There is no God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. God shall soon make thee manifest in truth on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, He hath power over all things. Soon shalt thou see all that are on earth worshipping God, thy Lord, seeking thee by night and by day. And there is naught but doth glorify God, thy Lord, through thee, and shall be among them that bow down before thee. Yet soon shalt thou see all, in the day of thy manifestation, veiled from thy signs, save those whom God hath chosen for thyself. These are they who believe in thee and in thy signs from thee. Upon these rest blessings from God and mercy from their Lord, and these are they who are guided. Soon shall ye see all judging by thy command, yet when thou judgest with justice by a wondrous and mighty command, none follow save those who have known God and who believe in thee and in what God hath revealed unto thee. Nothing behooveth thee save that whereby God, thy Lord, remembereth Himself. There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Yet if thou rememberest not thyself, and the evidences of thyself, and the things which God hath created for thee in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and what lieth between them, they are not created in the Book, though all stand by thy command from God. And when all remember that thou art in the most exalted heights by the remembrance of God, thy Lord - there is no God but I, the One, the Sovereign. And whatsoever thou rememberest apart from God, all within the bounds of their existence shall take their remembrance from their seats, and thou shalt begin them in a wondrous creation according to what God, thy Lord, hath willed concerning thyself. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the Wise. Compare not thyself with aught in the heavens or on the earth or between them, for according to what behooveth thee, the worlds cannot arise to it. And if all that God hath created from a beginning that hath no beginning until the time of thy manifestation should arise, and they be in rapture before thy countenance, they merit not with thee a mighty and glorious mention. How much less if one of thy creatures be veiled from what God hath created for thee or what thou createst by thy command! Say: Glory be to God above all that He hath created!

Say: Should any among Thy creation be veiled from that which God hath created for thee or which is created by thy command, glorified be God above all that hath been or shall be created, and verily We are independent of all things. Whoso believeth in Us, this is his Lord's glory, and then with all things. Let him therefore who willeth believe; this is a path of mighty glory. And whoso believeth not in Us hath believed aforetime and boweth down before Us in all Our previous Manifestations, and no deed shall be taken from him, and he shall enter the fire with those who enter therein. We have verily nurtured all who are in the Bayan that they might desire none but Thee and be among the believers in that which is revealed unto thee. Nay, We have desired for all upon earth likewise. When those who are in the Bayan possess all that is on earth and are triumphant thereon, We shall see what appeareth in the kingdom by thy Lord's command, and all imagine they act for Thy good pleasure. If Thou show mercy unto them and forgive them, verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. And if Thou take vengeance upon them and seize them, verily Thou art the Just, the All-Wise. Thy mercy hath preceded all things from before and after, and verily Thou art independent of the worlds. Thy Lord hath chosen thee for Himself, then chosen all for thee, and verily Thou art the Truth, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. Blessed are they who believe in Thee and in Thy signs, for these are they who shall attain. Love not to mention him who believeth not in Thee, even were he the highest or lowest in the Bayan. Judge them as Thou pleasest with truth, for Thou art the Best of judges. But Thou seest the entire Tree of the Bayan created from a single Point, and all are established thereby. If Thou acceptest some of them and rejectest others, verily Thou art All-Knowing, All-Wise, and verily Thou art independent of all things. If Thou acceptest all, verily Thou art Bountiful, Generous. If Thou rejectest all, verily Thou art All-Knowing, All-Wise. But all are poor before Thee, seeking Thy gracious acceptance. Verily Thou art the Bestower, the Gracious. Who can prevent Thy grace upon those in the Bayan, that Thou mightest guide them to the paths of guidance from Thy presence? Verily Thou art supremely Gracious. O all things! Have mercy upon yourselves from the day when ye shall not suffice, then by God's word ye shall endure, proceeding from a single soul, and ye shall all return as ye began. This day is like unto the days of Muhammad aforetime, and like unto the days of Ali before Muhammad thereafter. These are the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Ye perceive the essence of the Command, for all stand by God's Command from His presence, and ye are not veiled from this and that from the Source of the Command.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Equitable, the Most Equitable. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee \[...\]

I testify, O my God, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the heavenly dominion, Thine the might and the celestial realm, Thine the power and divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the earthly dominion and human realm, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the direction and perfection, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the stations and grandeur, Thine the power and action, Thine the mercy and grace, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the awe and sublimity, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the might and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and power, and Thine whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsistent, living, changeless, sovereign, all-pervading, holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou didst manifest me after the earth was filled with tyranny and oppression, and through me Thou hast filled it with equity and justice. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou art manifest above Thy creation and triumphant over Thy servants.O God! Preserve all who are in the Bayan for the days when Thou shalt manifest the Manifestation of Thyself. They ascend through what they possess to the highest pinnacle of glory and guidance, but before God their Lord, the Most Sublime, the All-Glorious, they shall be veiled by veils from Thy will in the Bayan and Thy purpose in the exposition, when all shall be convinced of the justice and equity wherein Thou shalt manifest the Manifestation of Thyself, and Thou shalt show them their lack of justice and equity. O God! Have mercy upon them when they shall see that they should accept what comes from Thee, for their injustice at that time shall be greater than their former injustice.O God! Fill through Him the kingdom of Thy heaven and earth with Thy equity and justice, Thy grace and bounty, Thy generosity and kindness. O God! Be for Thy friend an impregnable shelter, an invincible glory, a mighty support, a supreme protection, and an all-encompassing knowledge. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The third in the third. In the Name of God, the Most Just, the Most Just. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all created things, risen in His elevation above all existing things, made Himself invincible in His invincibility above all beings, become triumphant in His triumph above all atoms, and manifested Himself in His manifestation above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the One, the Just.He hath chosen an invincible essence, a radiant abstraction, an exalted simplicity, a manifest purity, and an eternal being. Then He revealed Himself to it through itself and cast into its reality the likeness of its own self. Then His signs appeared through it and filled His heavens and earth with true justice and absolute grace through \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Just, the Most Just! All praise belongs to God besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Just, the Most Just. All glory from God be upon the First Unity and those who resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen except the First Unity.I bear witness that the justice of God appears through none save the justice of the Sun of Truth. All claim justice for themselves, but in the sight of God none are truly just except those in the Bayan who observe His bounds and fear their Lord - they who, on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, will believe in His justice.You and all who are in the Bayan claim that if He Whom God shall make manifest were to pass judgment upon you, you would accept it. Then on the Day of His Manifestation, should God endow Him with the means of glory and power, you would accept His justice. But I swear by Him Who split the seed and created the soul, you shall hear the pure and absolute justice of God and the transcendent grace of God, yet you will not follow it. Perchance you will be veiled by a single word at the time of God's decree and His justice, which equals the value of a month's radiance in silver weight, while each one of you observes this verse concerning yourselves.We have witnessed the creation of that value, which appeared only after the earth was filled with remoteness and veils, though all were created for nearness to Him and His knowledge. When God manifests Him and each soul recognizes itself, on that Day you shall know that you are far removed and veiled. Were you not to ascend through what you possess to the horizon of piety like all peoples according to what was ordained in their religion, no glory would be yours in this. Rather, your glory lies in recognizing God your Lord on the Day of His Manifestation, then believing in and being assured of His decree and His justice, even though it be against your own selves.Let no 'why' or 'wherefore' or 'how' occur to your hearts or appear from your tongues or your outer being. Hear every command of Him Whom God shall make manifest in all particulars and universals, in matters religious and worldly, with great submission. If you follow this path, then you shall believe in God's justice. Otherwise, there is no doubt that you believe in God's justice in the Bayan, but this will not benefit you on the Day of Resurrection unless you judge by God's justice on that Day.And it has four stations: The First in the First - In the Name of God, the Most Free, the Most Free! There is no God but He, the Most Free, the Most Free. Say: God is more free than all who possess freedom. None in the heavens or earth or what lies between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign freedom. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily, He is the Free, the Liberating, the All-Freeing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom boweth down in worship whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. And praise be to God before Whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in reverence. Say: All are humbly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Glory and the Might, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He is, verily, potent over all things.Blessed is He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily He ordaineth for you every good. Will ye not then be thankful? Say: God will surely try you with that which causeth you sorrow, that He may witness whether ye be patient or impatient. Grieve not, therefore, when God trieth you with aught, but be patient, for verily the ultimate victory belongeth to the patient ones.Say: God will surely relieve you of all your sorrows. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely enrich you after your poverty. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely deliver you from your imprisonment. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely exalt you after this. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely grant you your offspring. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely heal your sick. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely cause you to sail upon the sea by His command. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely cool you after your heat. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely try you after your patience. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely grant you security after your fear. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke?Say: God will surely create you and provide for you and cause you to die and give you life and resurrect you on the Day of Resurrection from your resting places. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely remove affliction. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely unite you with what He hath created from your own selves. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely preserve you in your beginning and your end. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely teach you the knowledge of all things. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely nurture you in your mothers' wombs. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will surely send down from the water \[...\]

Say: Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God will teach you the knowledge of all things. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth nurture you in your mothers' wombs. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth cause the water of your being to descend from your fathers' loins. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth provide for you in your life and will raise you up after death to sublime heights. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth renew in every Dispensation the creation of your hearts, spirits, souls and bodies through the Primal Unity. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth renew the ordinances of your religion as He pleaseth. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth renew the prohibitions of your religion in every Dispensation. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth cause fire to emerge from the green tree. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth bring forth water from the rock. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth send the winds from the unseen realm of air. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth establish the earth upon the water. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth cause to spring forth from the earth what is planted therein. Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God doth reveal the instruments of your tillage.Is there any god besides God whom ye invoke? Say: God hath permitted all His servants fire and air, then water and earth - ye shall not withhold these one from another. This is of God's bounty in that Dispensation. Henceforth ye shall neither buy nor sell save that from which ye derive benefit, for this shall not be reckoned as pertaining to the essence of fire, air, water and earth, but rather to what appeareth from their effects. Thus do ye buy and sell. This is of God's grace and bounty toward all His servants, if ye be of them that are assured of God's command. This is of the bounty of the Point of the Bayan unto all that hath been and shall be created. Ye shall not buy from or sell to them that are not of your religion, for this is a gift from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth and all that is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.O all things! We have bestowed upon you your elements that ye may, on the Day of Resurrection, enter into the religion of God with the elements of your hearts, souls, spirits and bodies. This is of God's grace and mercy, then of His bounty and His gift unto all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. Ye shall not purchase water, but ye shall give what is due to him who bringeth it unto you, for this is the glory of his labor, not the glory of the water. Thus do ye judge in both instances, before it and the Unity after it. And unto God belongeth the Most Sublime Similitude in the heavens \[...\]

To God belong the most exalted similitudes in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Thus doth God bestow His favor upon His servants out of His bounty. Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.God hath forbidden you to sell to any save your own people, nor to purchase from others, that ye may, in your religion, conduct commerce amongst yourselves according to what God hath permitted you therein. Say: Verily the earth, and the water, and the air, and the fire are yours, if ye be of them that testify to the truth. That which belongeth unto God belongeth unto the Primal Point. We have, of Our dominion, bestowed this water upon all the earth, that ye may be of them that are thankful in the religion of God.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Excellence, Thine the Sovereignty and the material world, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Likeness and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Transcendence, Thine the Sovereignty and the Might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation.All exist through Thy bounty, all are created through Thy creation, all are brought into being through Thy generosity, all are made manifest through Thy grace, and all are originated through Thy favor. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Living, Self-Subsisting, Wise, Just, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Through Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them according to a measure. Through Thy will Thou hast formed all things and fashioned them according to a pattern.Thou hast caused the eternal elements to emerge from the grasp of all things and made them the dawning-places of Thy gifts and the daysprings of Thy bounty for all Thy creation, both those whom Thou hast created and those whom Thou wilt create. Glorified and exalted art Thou! I shall glorify Thee for the gift of Thy fire with what Thou art worthy of - there is no God but Thee. Glory be unto Thee! I have ever been of them that glorify Thee. And I shall praise Thee for the gift of air from Thy bounty with praise worthy of Thee and none other. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. I have ever been of them that praise Thee. And I shall proclaim Thy unity for the gift of water as befitteth Thy unity. Glory be unto Thee! I have ever been of them that unite. And I shall magnify Thee for the gift of earth after water as befitteth Thy greatness. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. I have ever been of them that magnify Thee. This, O my God, is of Thy bounty from Him Whom Thou hast made the Manifestation of Thyself.

I magnify Thee for the gift of clay after water, by the truth of Thy Greatness. Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. Verily, I have been among those who magnify Thee. This, O my God, is from Thy bounty through Him Whom Thou hast made the Manifestation of Thyself. Yet Thou witnesseth how some of Thy servants have forbidden what Thou hast permitted from Thy House, though Thou hadst enabled the earth for Him through Thy power. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast not permitted anyone to withhold from another water, air, fire, or clay, for Thou art the Creator of all things and their Sustainer, the One Who causeth all things to die and giveth life. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! Glorified and magnified art Thou! Glorified and elevated art Thou! Glorified and bountiful art Thou! Glorified and bestowing art Thou! Glorified and generous art Thou! Glorified and gracious art Thou! All Thy servants are in Thy grasp. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Free, the Most FreePraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His elevation above all contingent things, Who hath raised Himself in His loftiness above all existing things, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all created things, Who hath empowered Himself in His might above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath established His dominion in His sovereignty over all atoms. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Releasing. All things have found rest through His bounty, His bestowal, His grace and His giving. I praise Him with such praise as none of His creation hath preceded, and I thank Him with such thanks as none of His servants hath offered - praise that filleth the pillars of every fire with the elevation of His glorification, the pillars of every air with the inaccessibility of His praise, the pillars of every water with the exaltation of His oneness, and the pillars of every clay with the sublimity of His magnification. Praise pure and pristine, like refined camphor, abstract essence and sanctified being - praise that filleth all the heavens with His grace, the earth and all that is therein and thereon with His bounty, and what lieth between them with His kindness, from the kingdom of His command and creation, from the heights of His generosity. The essences found rest at the dawning of His bounty in His fire, the realities found rest at the rising of His grace in the air of His fire, then the souls in the water of His generosity, then the selves in the clay of His gift. I bear witness with a testimony exalted, elevated, resplendent, majestic, beauteous, mighty, great, powerful, pleasing, noble, sovereign, possessing, transcendent, that there is no God but Him and that the One of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. Thus hath God permitted through His bounty the Manifestation of His Self to all His creation from the Primary Causes, and He hath willed to make them evident in every Manifestation without end unto that which hath no end, through the bestowal of His Unique mystery. Thus hath God ordained \[...\]

Praise be to God Who manifests His will in every Revelation with infinite bounties flowing from His Divine Unity, for thus has God ordained and decreed, and there can be no change in His Revelation. God has ever been and shall ever remain the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the All-Giving, the Most Gracious.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Restful, the Most Restful. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Restful, the Most Restful. And verily all glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whosoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that true rest is unattainable except through thy recognition of the Tree of Truth and thy knowledge of His good-pleasure. When thy reality findeth rest, it behooveth thee; else thou art in trepidation and awe before God's command and justice, and in tranquility and repose through God's bounty and grace. In all things, if thou perceiveth not therein thy Lord's good-pleasure, thou shalt find no rest therein. If thou desirest to be ever at rest, abide in God's good-pleasure, for without this, even shouldst thou attain every pleasure, thou wouldst find no rest within thyself between thee and thy Lord. Therefore it shall torment thee. Seek refuge in God from aught save His good-pleasure, for this is the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Desire naught but His good-pleasure, for this is of God's grace, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, and of God's bounty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted.The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Bountiful, the Most Bountiful. There is no God but He, the Most Bountiful, the Most Bountiful. Say: God is the Most Bountiful above all who show bounty. None can ever withhold himself from the sovereignty of His bounty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath ever been abundantly bountiful and gracious. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Praise be to God before Whom bow down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Grandeur, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who deviateth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Exalted be He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Through God's bounty He will sustain you in the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth between them. Will ye not then be thankful? Say: Verily God's bounty on the Day of Resurrection hath laid bare the intentions of those who claimed: "We act according to what was inscribed in letters from God concerning the third of the first Unity," which were sent with crimson ink, declaring "This is from God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting." This was so in their estimation and His, for this is a test wherewith ye are tried. When they beheld it attributed to Him, though all His mention was but praise of Himself, they judged it false. Thus did God's bounty inform them that these were their Imams, whereupon they wished they were among the dead, having wrongfully judged their Imams, being not among those endowed with insight. Say: What they have judged concerning the Gate is greater than what they judged concerning the third of the Unity, though by his mention the people of the Furqan are resurrected. But since they knew not God their Lord and the Gate of His attributes, they are unable to act for God. In God's sight this is greater than all their nightly and daily strivings. Say: God will bestow upon you goodly bounties - will ye not then be thankful? Say: God will command you with the growth of what remaineth, as ye spend in unity what ye love. This is the best of your sustenance and bounty in God's Book, did ye but know. Likewise in the goodly things, if ye would bear true witness. He it is Who created you and whatsoever ye acquire. When ye desire to purchase nineteen units, each weighing one mithqal of silver, then give all that and purchase one, that on the Day of Resurrection ye may be elevated through the First Unity from the Living One. Thus doth God gather the splendor of the Living One in the Primary Letters, that on the Day of God's Manifestation ye may not be veiled from your stations. Say: God's bounty in your hearts, spirits, souls and bodies are the verses of Unity in the Bayan. God hath sustained you and bestowed His grace upon you from His bounty. Say: The day God will transform His bounty upon you and make it greater than His previous bounty, ye shall enjoy what God ordaineth for you. For if ye are sustained after God's Cause with what ye were sustained before, your example in the Book would be like those who were given the Book before you, though they recite God's Book or walk in His good-pleasure. But God hath not permitted this for you; rather He desireth that ye be sustained with an impregnable, exalted sustenance and a lofty, sublime bounty. This is your sustenance from Him Whom God shall make manifest, and your bounty from His presence. Do ye not wish to be thus sustained and blessed? Say: Your example and the example of your religion is like your own selves and the example of your sustenance from your end, after ye reach the last of your age in your elder years - in every condition ye seek sustenance. Likewise in every Manifestation ye follow a religion.

And like your sustenance from your ultimate end after you have reached the last of your life in your old age, you receive sustenance in every condition. Likewise in every Dispensation you follow a religion. But God knows your beginning and your end, and how you are reared in every Dispensation. Say: The most glorious of words are the words of God by which you receive sustenance. Say: The excellence of the Arabic words over the Persian is like the excellence of what was revealed in the Bayan over what was revealed before. God loves this, then that - you speak the truth, and besides these two We were not speaking. Therefore examine the Bayan, for besides the mention of the Arabic and Persian, you will find nothing else therein. Say: Honor has reached the Persians inasmuch as they trace their lineage to the Point of the Bayan, as you know. Say: Honor has been cut off from the Arabs, if you bear true witness. Say: God has favored the Persians in that He made manifest the Point of the Bayan from among them, just as He favored the Arabs before and made Muhammad manifest among them. Therefore they now possess noble distinction, if they truly believe. But they have committed that which God is ashamed to mention, and God will manifest their souls and their land, and will fill them and their land with the signs of His Manifestation. Will you not seek elevation through that which God has elevated you, and ascend through that which the All-Glorious, the Most High has mentioned you, far above what you mention? Say: God has favored the Point of the Bayan with two honors from His presence, from which all are cut off. He has manifested from His presence the glory of both the Arabs and Persians - this is among your bounds, otherwise God is sanctified and exalted above what you mention. All are servants of God and all are created through the Point of the Bayan. All honor is as utter nothingness before Him - do you not see? All glory is as sheer nothing before Him - do you not perceive? All in the heavens and earth and what lies between them glorify Him, and all stand firm through God's command. But you must observe the Most Great Manifestation in the Book of God on the Day of Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest, for through Him are you glorified. Your relationship to Him is more exalted than your relationship to the Point of the Bayan, if you truly believe. Say: That relationship of the Point of the Bayan is in the end, and the Command is but one, before and after - all stand firm through it. But since you do not understand God's Command, you are unable to see it from both perspectives as you look upon it. Say: Through God's bounty are you created. Say: Through God's bounty are you sustained. Say: Through God's bounty do you die. Say: Through God's bounty are you given life. Say: Through God's bounty do you live. Say: Through God's bounty do you move about in the chambers of your paradise. Say: Through God's bounty do you glory upon your thrones in the Garden of Paradise. And God is the Protector of those who believe and those who place their trust in their Lord. God is the Protector of those who are God-fearing.

God is the Protector of them that fear Him and them that unto their Lord do return. God is the Guardian of them that are God-fearing in the days of God and who, with truth, prostrate themselves before Him. God is your Protector and the Protector of your forebears of old. God is your Protector and the Protector of your mothers who have gone before. God is your Protector and the Protector of your manifest brethren. God is your Protector and the Protector of your hidden sisters. Say: Sufficient unto us is our Protector in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that lieth between them. In Him do we place our trust, and let the faithful servants of God place their trust in Him.Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, and that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the station and the grandeur, Thine the glory and the invincibility, Thine the power and the exaltation, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the dominion and justice, Thine the station and the grandeur, Thine the joy and the gladness, Thine the authority and detachment, and Thine whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been sovereign throughout all eternity, and a King that will never cease to be. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! All Thy servants are within Thy grasp, that the dwellers of Thy heaven and earth may worship Thee and they who abide in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation may sanctify Thee. Thou art He Who existed before all things, Who will exist after all things, Who will remain after all things, Who bringeth all things into being, and Who existeth with all things.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Through Thy bounty, O my God, are all made prosperous, and through Thy provision, O my Creator, do all receive their sustenance, and through Thy generosity, O my Beloved, do all obtain their portion, and through Thy favor, O my Purpose, do all come to possess, and through Thy grace, O my Adored One, are all rendered thankful. Thine is the most exalted loftiness above every height, and the most glorious elevation above every similitude. Thou hast ever been the Subduer over all possibilities, the Manifest over all existence, the Impregnable over all creation, the Exalted over all atoms, the Most High over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, the Sovereign over all who dwell in the kingdoms of beginning and ending, and the Ordainer over all who dwell in the kingdom of symbols and allusions.Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, Self-Sustaining, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Most Holy, Everlasting, Ever-Enduring, Exalted, Self-Sufficient, All-Glorious, All-Beauteous, Most Noble, All-Powerful, All-Possessing, All-Manifesting, and All-Concealing. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things through Thy power \[...\]

In what Thou hast fashioned, Thou hast created all things by Thy power and ordained them with precise ordainment, and by Thy will Thou hast formed all things and shaped them with perfect shaping. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.All praise be unto God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things, and manifested His power above all existing things, and established His sovereignty above all beings, and shown forth His appearance above all atoms, and revealed His dominion above all that dwelleth in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and demonstrated His strength above all who dwell in the realms of command and endings, and elevated His loftiness above all who dwell in the kingdom of symbols and signs.I testify, and all creation with me beareth witness, with a testimony purified from the signs of limitations and sanctified from the tokens of veils - a testimony that is resplendent, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, luminous, merciful, complete, articulate, mighty, knowing, powerful, well-pleased, loving, noble, sovereign, dominant, triumphant - whose beginning indicateth its end, and whose outward manifestation indicateth its inner reality, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Bountiful.I testify, and all creation with me beareth witness, that He, glorified be His praise, hath perfected His favor upon all His servants and completed His bounties upon all who dwell in the kingdoms of His earth and heaven, through His manifestation of the Divine Point of the Unseen, the eternal Divine Countenance, the Single Sacred Face, the Unique Essential Being, and the Luminous Primal Reality, upon whom He hath sent down His verses and through whom He hath revealed His clear signs, whereby His heaven hath been filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him. His grace hath preceded all His creation and His favors have encompassed all His servants.I praise Him for all His bounties with a praise that none before me hath offered and none among His servants can offer. And I thank Him for all His favors with a gratitude that none among His servants hath expressed, nor can anyone dwelling in His heaven and earth express. For He is the Truth realized in the realities of truth, the Essence manifested in the essences of being, the Substance expressed in the substances of existence, the Pure revealed in the purities of manifestation, and the Light illumined in the lights of radiance.Who can encompass His praise, given the transcendence of His remembrance and inaccessibility? And who can enumerate His bounties, given the sublimity of His bestowal and grace? I testify, and all things testify, that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. All that is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them glorifieth Him. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.And verily all glory be unto the Primal Unity from God, the Most Bountiful, the Most Bountiful.

And verily the Glory from God is upon the First Primary Unity and upon such as resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save that First Unity. And furthermore, I bear witness that God hath ever been the Possessor of magnificent favors and mighty bounties. He hath created naught except to manifest His favor upon all things and to exalt His gift upon all things. How great are God's favors and how exalted His gift! Therefore the purpose of creation is the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest - exalted and glorified be His mention, and elevated and sublime be His station! This is a favor beyond which there is no favor, nor can any favor be associated with it, nor equal it, nor resemble it, nor suffice in place of it, for all favors have been created for the manifestation of this favor.Behold the kingdom of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. Verily God, glorified and mighty is He, hath created all things for the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - exalted be His mention - that all may declare, after He hath made Himself known unto them: "Yea, we have ever been believers in God and His signs."Consider how all the existences of favor and the essences of bounty have been created and brought into being to prostrate themselves before that eternal favor and everlasting gift. For were God to bestow upon thee every favor, yet shouldst thou fail to attain His presence, it would be as though thou hadst never partaken of any favor. For thou and all that He hath given thee were created for belief in Him, obedience unto Him, love for Him, His good-pleasure and His Cause. Indeed, should God not bestow upon thee any outward favor, yet grant thee guidance from Him Whom God shall make manifest and faith in Him, purely for God - glorified be His majesty - and patience in what pleaseth God - mighty be His glory - it would be as though thou hadst been blessed with every favor, lacking naught thereof.Even shouldst thou toil from the beginning to the end of thy life to acquire favors and provide sustenance for thyself or those placed under thy charge, this is only for the sake of thy life, that thou mayest attain the Day of His Manifestation and manifest the fruit of thy creation by saying before God: "Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Verily, I am the first of them that worship." Otherwise, what fruit will result from those favors from the beginning to the end of thy life with which thou hast satisfied thyself, while God hath made thee a witness over them?Perchance these creatures toil from the beginning to the end of their lives for the favors of their bodies, whose pleasure is measured by what they eat, though God hath taught them that this is naught but means for sustaining their hearts, spirits, souls and bodies. Yet they pay no heed. They begin from dust, enjoy God's bounties, and return to dust, paying no attention to the fruit of their creation and gratitude to their Creator. Rather, they make the favors of their bodies a cause for neglecting the favors of their hearts. Say: Glory be to God and exalted is He above what they mention!By Him Who causeth the seed to split and Who breatheth the spirit of life, if anyone were given throughout his life every favor for which \[...\]

By Him Who creates the soul! Should anyone bestow upon thee from the beginning to the end of thy life every blessing for its own sake, yet shouldst thou fail to recognize Him on the day of His manifestation, verily thou wouldst be veiled by transient blessings from eternal and everlasting benedictions. This is what I counsel thee, and all things are from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.And it hath four degrees. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Enriching, the Most Enriching! There is no God but He, the Most Enriching, the Most Enriching! Say: God is Most Enriching above any possessor of riches. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of His enriching sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Enricher, the Enriching, the Rich. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and between them. Say: All bow down before Him. Praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and earth and between them make glorification. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He, the Kingdom and the Realm, then the Might and the Dominion, then the Power and the Divine Kingdom, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Acquire ye such knowledge as will save you on the Day of Resurrection, if ye desire to learn. Say: All the religious communities and their divines, had they known the true knowledge, would not have remained in their religion. Thus shall ye be tested on the Day of Resurrection. How many were the divines of the Gospel who knew the knowledge of truth in their possession, yet when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came to them, their knowledge profited them not and they entered the fire, while none could help them. And how many were the divines thereafter in the Quran whose numbers none can reckon save God their Lord. Yet when the proof of their Lord came to them, they entered not the true religion despite their knowledge, and deemed themselves learned. Can such knowledge profit its possessor? Say: Glory be to God! Do ye comprehend the true knowledge? This is your knowledge of the proof of your religion. When ye have learned this, then on the Day of Resurrection when ye hear the verses of God from Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye shall believe. Then shall your knowledge and your deeds profit you. This is what God your Lord counseleth you: O people of learning, fear ye God on the Day of Resurrection! How often have ye read in the Quran what God revealed aforetime concerning the Day of Resurrection, and now hath come the Truth with clear signs \[...\]

Truth hath come with manifest signs, yet ye are heedless. Say: Have ye not read therein, O people, "Fear ye your Lord! Verily the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing. On the day when every nursing mother shall abandon her suckling, and thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they are not drunken, but severe will be the chastisement of God." From the first moment We made Ourselves known unto you, the Hour hath come upon you, and ye are drunken before your Lord, would ye but understand. The proof of your religion, that ye might thereby enter into the religion of God. How is it that ye cast not aside every burden in the Furqan if ye be assured of God's command? Say: In every Manifestation from the Primal Point, ye carry the traditions of your religion and your world, then there is no way for you except that on the Day of Resurrection ye shall lay down what ye have carried and then take up what God ordaineth in the next creation, then fear God in His religion. How is it that on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye are veiled by what ye have carried? This is the day ye shall lay down your burden before your Lord when the messengers of Him Whom God shall make manifest come unto you with clear proofs. Fear ye God on that day, for if ye lay not down your burden, ye shall enter into the fire. Your burden shall destroy you - thus doth God counsel you, O ye who bear burdens, that ye may be God-fearing. Say: The first of what ye lay down of your burden is the Primal Word, then all that was created thereby. Quicker than the twinkling of an eye shall ye lay down what ye have carried, then quicker than the twinkling of an eye shall ye take up God's Cause, then shall ye be raised up in truth. How shall your wives lay down their burden when ye are greater in God's sight if ye lay not down your burden? This is what He teacheth you that ye may be God-fearing on the Day of Resurrection. Say: If they lay down their burden after nine months have passed, what is in their wombs is completed, nay rather they become themselves. How then have ye carried your Lord's command throughout the lengthy period of the letter Ha, yet even now ye lay it not down? Have mercy on yourselves and lay down all that ye have carried, for quicker than the twinkling of an eye shall ye take up what ye lay down - the essence of what God hath chosen for His proof, and ye shall be exalted until the Day of Resurrection. Say: Your glory in your religion and your world lieth in your relationship to God, your Lord. How is it that on that day ye relate not yourselves to God and desire to be cut off, when your relationship aforetime was unto God, would ye but reflect a little! Say: God hath forbidden you to swear by His name, that ye may be detached. Ye magnify God's name and then on the Day of God's manifestation ye magnify the meaning of the Name, yet ye swear not by the Name but pass judgment on its meaning in a way that none should judge another. Were ye to recognize Him upon Whom ye pass judgment, ye would instantly die from fear of God your Lord and awe of God within your souls. Fear ye, O people of the Bayan, from the day ye shall know Him Whom God shall make manifest. God is independent of you and of all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, but ye are poor on the Day of Resurrection until ye lay down your burden before God, then God shall cause you to bear that whereby ye shall ascend unto another resurrection. Say: Ye lay down verses \[...\]

But you are poor on the Day of Resurrection when you lay down your burden before God, then God will carry you as you ascend to the next Resurrection. Say: You lay down the verses of the First One, but how can you not perceive the power of God's Command and how do you not see on the Day of Resurrection? Look to the Point of the Bayan, then similarly draw proof from Him Whom God shall make manifest. If He wishes, He will preserve within your souls verses that were never revealed before, and if He wishes, He will remove them or renew them. Say: All command is in God's hands - He does what He wishes and ordains what He wills. His is all that is in the heavens and earth and what lies between them, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. Say: To Him Whom God shall make manifest belongs all that is in the heavens and earth and what lies between them. God has ordained it for Him - would that you were certain of what God has ordained for Him! Yet after your knowledge you remain uncertain. Glorified be God, before and after, there is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. And praise be to God in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and what lies between them, there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Affirming, the Most AffirmingGlorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, and Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, and Thine the Power and the Sovereignty, and Thine the Strength and the Majesty, and Thine the Grandeur and Glory, and Thine the Beauty and Grace, and Thine the Countenance and Perfection, and Thine the Likeness and Examples, and Thine the Station and Sublimity, and Thine the Force and Action, and Thine the Mercy and Bounty, and Thine the Authority and Justice, and Thine the Greatness and Independence, and Thine the Pride and Transcendence, and Thine the Might and Exaltation, and Thine the Joy and Gladness, and Thine the Sovereignty and Power, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, Everlasting, Sovereign, Guardian, Holy, Enduring, Independent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor had Thou any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them precisely, and by Thy will Thou hast formed all things and fashioned them perfectly. Before Thee prostrate all who are in the heavens and earth and what lies between them, and unto Thee glorify all who are in the kingdom of Command and Creation and what lies beneath them. Thou hast ever been supreme over all possibilities, manifest above all beings, inaccessible above all created things, exalted above all atoms, mighty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, sovereign over all Thou hast created and wilt create through origination, and transcendent above all Thou hast brought into being\[...\]

Exalted art Thou above all that Thou hast created and dost create through Thy power of creation. Thou wert before all things and wilt ever be, and Thou art the Being after all things in glory and majesty, and Thou art the Essence with all things in grandeur and independence, and Thou art the Creator after all things in might and sovereignty. Wherefore, O my God, cause the people of the Bayan to hold fast and to be assured that all therein shall attain Thy good-pleasure on the Day of Thy coming. For on that Day, through Thy word "Yea" from Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, the affairs of those in the Bayan shall be set aright through Thy bounty, Thy generosity, Thy grace, Thy favor and Thy tender mercy. And shouldst Thou say "Nay" from Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, those upon whom Thou hast passed judgment shall perish. This is Thy justice wherein is no injustice, and Thy equity wherein is no partiality. Thy decree, O my God, is justice and Thy verdict, O my God, is truth. Thine is the most exalted sovereignty that will never cease to be, and the most resplendent dominion throughout eternity of eternities.Wherefore, O my God, send down all Thy mercy upon them that are in the Bayan until the Day wherein Thou shalt manifest the sign of Thy oneness, the King of Thy eternity, the Sovereign of Thy singleness, the Countenance of Thy divinity, and the Manifestation of Thy grandeur. Then shalt Thou judge as Thou pleasest. Verily Thou art God, there is no God but Him, the One, the All-Glorious.In the Name of God, the Most Powerful, the Most PowerfulPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath raised Himself in His elevation above all atoms, and hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all created things, and hath revealed Himself in His manifestation above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creatures bear witness, and He Himself beareth witness, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Self-Subsisting. This is a testimony purified from all allusions and sanctified from all indications - a testimony established in the kingdom of holiness and majesty, and demonstrative of the sovereignty of might and beauty. This is a testimony that is inaccessible, elevated, sanctified, mighty, resplendent, majestic, beauteous, magnificent, merciful, luminous, articulate, perfect, great, powerful, learned, well-pleasing, mighty, loving, noble, sovereign, royal, advanced, bountiful, impregnable, generous, gracious, kind, manifest, hidden and transcendent.This is a testimony that filleth the pillars of the heavens with the light of might and majesty, and the essences of the earth with the splendors of holiness and beauty, and what lieth between them with the ornaments of glory and grandeur. This is a testimony that causeth all utterances to proclaim that there is no God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word, whom He hath chosen from the summit of all possible things for the station of His knowledge, whom God hath accepted from the heights of all existent things for the station of His Manifestation, whom God hath selected from the heaven of all created things for the station of His revelation, whom God hath distinguished from the inaccessibility of all atoms for the station of His glorification, and whom God hath singled out from the elevation of all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven for the station of His sovereignty. He hath sufficed for all that hath been and shall be created from the manifestations of His glory, and He hath satisfied all that hath been and shall be brought into being from the evidences of His revelation. He hath chosen for Him exalted letters, inscribed lines, infinite mysteries, resplendent lights, and effulgent manifestations, and through these He hath revealed whatsoever He hath willed in the kingdom of earth \[...\]

Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Exalted, the Most Sublime. The glory from God rests upon the First Unity and upon those who resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. I testify that thy words "Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Protect me from that which saddens my soul in my religion and my worldly affairs" reach unto God, and God will answer thy prayer when thou callest upon Him through the gate of His calling and turnest unto Him through the portals of His guidance.Consider how all peoples call upon God, their Lord, for their religious and worldly desires, yet why are they not answered and why do they not escape the fire of God? Because their supplications proceed not from the path of God's good-pleasure nor from the ways He hath ordained. Thus on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, shouldst thou call upon God with every prayer, He will not answer thee nor will it profit thee unless thou callest upon Him through Him Whom He shall make manifest. Then, when thou callest upon Him, God will answer thee with verses that shall cause thy soul to be convinced that they are from God, the One, the Sovereign.From time immemorial until the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan, God, glorified be He, addressed none save His Messenger, Who is the Throne of His Revelation and the Seat of His Concealment. However, in this Revelation, God hath lifted the veil of verses and sent them down upon whomsoever He willeth, from the most exalted to the lowliest atom, as a token of His mercy, His gift and His grace. In all this He intended none save the Point of the Bayan and desired naught else. This, however, none can witness save the unitarians, and none can comprehend save the sincere ones who, when they hear the verses of God, bow down in humble adoration.It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Delivering, the Most Delivering. There is no God but He, the Most Delivering, the Most Delivering. Say: God is the Most Delivering above all who deliver. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withstand the power of His sovereign deliverance. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Deliverer, the Delivering, the Delivered. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Divine Reality, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not.

And His justice that never oppresses, and His sovereignty that never changes, and His unique power from whose grasp nothing escapes, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates whatsoever He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God did indeed deliver Joseph aforetime and made him a noble sovereign. Say: God will assuredly deliver everyone who calleth upon Him and make him a mighty sovereign. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: God will surely deliver the Bayan through His command. Verily, He is swift and nigh. Say: God will deliver you from all your sorrows and hath power over all things. Say: If you deliver anyone for the sake of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then you will find guidance unto God, your Lord, through that Name. Say: God hath forbidden you in the Bayan to cause grief unto anyone, and moreover, never to slay anyone, for you, in your lives, have departed from your religion through what hath been revealed in your religion. If you transgress the bounds set by God and deny all who are in the Bayan, you show no fear of God. Fear ye then after your death, for God will surely take vengeance upon you and cast you into the fire. Therefore have mercy upon yourselves and exchange not eternal glory for that which perisheth, nor barter the life to come for this present life. Say: Those who were given the Book before you imagine that they worship God while they follow other than God. Therefore take heed, O people of the Bayan, that ye worship none but God, for if you follow other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, then you are worshipping other than God. How can you worship one who is created like yourselves when God, your Lord, hath forbidden you to associate anything with Him? Fear ye God during the night except the Night in the Bayan, for each of you calleth unto his own self, and on the Day of Resurrection you will be accused before your Lord, Him Whom God shall make manifest, of worshipping other than God, since you are content with what you possess while remaining veiled from Him Who created you and your religion, even as those who followed not Us on the day of Our manifestation, and We judged them as non-worshippers, for had they truly worshipped God their Lord, they would have turned unto Us. Therefore fear ye, O people of the Bayan, for by this shall you be tested, and through your allegiance to Him Whom God shall make manifest shall you be delivered. Be not veiled by your circumstances, for all glory belongeth unto God and unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye but knew. And all riches belong to Him Whom He shall make manifest, if through Him ye seek to be enriched. Let not what you possess deceive you, for you and all that you possess are but creatures before God. Therefore worship ye God by following the Truth in His manifestation, though ye cannot endure for even a moment.

And ye show no patience with respect to your own selves, and ye show no patience with respect to what passeth through your hearts. For during the time of your patience, your selves and your deeds pass away. When the Proof appeareth, verily the testimony is perfected unto all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, whether ye believe or show patience as ye showed when ye heard of Muhammad, how God made manifest His Cause and made it to prevail over all things. Yet at the time of His manifestation ye veiled yourselves with that which caused God to be ashamed. And God is with those who fear Him in His path and those who do good. It is as though I behold you throughout your nights, occupying your seats, glorying in your religion, and gathering books in your chambers like unto nineteen camel-loads. Verily ye are among the witnesses from the Point of the Bayan, and ye judge in the true religion. But when He Whom God shall make manifest cometh unto you, ye turn not unto Him Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life. Ye turn unto Him Whom God shall make manifest while rejoicing in what ye possess, nay rather ye weep. For a single "nay" from Him Whom God shall make manifest annihilateth you all and your books and whatsoever ye possess. Therefore fear ye God in this matter, for unto Us shall ye return. We have originated you and your religion, and We have made the religion of the Bayan a trust with you until the day of Our manifestation, that ye may return it unto Us at the time of the Manifestation. And We shall assuredly forbid it unto you and take vengeance upon you after your death, for We have power over you and your religion, did ye but know. Say: God is the Creator of all things. He hath sent down every religion by His command. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore be ye ashamed, O trustees of God's Cause at the appearance of the Gate of God, for ye shall be tested in less than the twinkling of an eye, and in less than the twinkling of an eye shall ye be established in the highest heaven of glory if ye prostrate yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest as ye have prostrated from the beginning of your lives unto their end, and if ye accept God with your inmost and outward selves, your visible and hidden selves, your first and your last. Then shall ye enter the ocean of Names. God shall make you mirrors of His Self wherein naught shall be seen save God. Ye shall possess that most glorious might. But if ye veil yourselves, He shall surely make you the lowest of all peoples through His word. And if ye believe not in Him, verily those who are endowed with knowledge of Him do believe. This is God's command in the Bayan, that ye may be God-fearing. Think ye that ye can flee from Our grasp in any wise? Say: Glory be to God above what ye mention! Ye labor for Us night and day, yet We attribute not your works unto Ourselves except when ye truly prove God your Lord. Say: Verily, He Whom God shall make manifest is the proof for the God-fearing among you, not those who consider themselves God-fearing. Ye love this, but God hath exalted the mention of His proof and made Him a testimony unto all the worlds. Say: The worlds are they who recognize God through Him on the day of His manifestation.

And He made Him a proof unto all the worlds. Say: The worlds are they who recognize God through Him on the day of His manifestation, and who are assured of the signs of God from His presence. And all others are as stationary stone, if ye be of them that know. Say: He Who createth the pearl in its shell, Who preserveth it upon its branches, and Who maketh it a gift from His presence unto whomsoever He willeth - verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. Say: Verily, He Who fashioneth the pearls in their shells hath likewise fashioned you in your mothers' wombs. This is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but He, the One, the All-Fashioning.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most GloriousGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and the splendor, Thine the sovereignty and the realm of man, Thine the majesty and the glory, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the strength and the deeds, Thine the mercy and the bounty, Thine the dominance and the justice, Thine the similitude and the examples, Thine the stations and the exaltation, Thine the grandeur and the magnificence, Thine the might and the invincibility, Thine the power and the transcendence, Thine the joy and the gladness, Thine the sovereignty and the authority, and Thine whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.I beseech Thee by Thy glory to deliver, on the Day of Resurrection, all who are in the Bayan through Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest with clear proof, howsoever Thou willest, whensoever Thou willest, and wheresoever Thou willest. For I have loved that none should remain undelivered on the day of Thy manifestation, and I have loved that all who are in the Bayan, nay all who are on earth, nay all things, should be delivered to such extent that in the knowledge of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest there remaineth nothing save that which is pleasing unto Him.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the One God, the Self-Subsisting, the Single, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sufficient, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in dominion, nor any protector through Thy command. Glorified and exalted art Thou! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst deliver Joseph from the bondage of servitude and made him a king of the might of lordship by Thy leave, that Thou wilt deliver all who are in the Bayan from every sorrow Thou hast created or wilt create, and that Thou wilt bring them unto the summit of Thy glory and Thy riches, Thy generosity and Thy loftiness, Thy grace and Thy favor, Thy bounty and Thy gift, Thy munificence and Thy benevolence, Thy holiness and Thy splendor. For Thou hast ever been existent before all things, and enduring after all things, and the Creator of all things, and the Essence with all things. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away.

A kingdom that vanisheth not, a justice that deviateth not, a sovereignty that changeth not, an Absolute One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst whatsoever Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and ascended in His loftiness above all created things, and become inaccessible in His remoteness above all existing things, and shone forth in His radiance above all atoms, and surged forth in His surge above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, from time immemorial, in that which hath been and will ever be. He hath made Himself known through His creation, through what the Point of the Bayan hath manifested from His presence and through that wherewith He hath filled the kingdom of His heaven and His earth, that there is none other God but Him, the Deliverer of all His servants, the Exalter of all His chosen ones, the Glorifier of all them that love Him, the Abaser of all who believe not in His signs, the Enricher of all who are enriched by His riches, the Teacher of all who are taught by His knowledge, the Magnifier of all who are magnified by His majesty, the Illuminator of all who are illumined by His splendor, the Beautifier of all who are beautified by His beauty, the Glorifier of all who are glorified by His glory, the Enlightener of all who are enlightened by His light, the Merciful to all who receive mercy through His mercy, the Perfecter of all who are perfected through His words, the Completer of all who are completed through His perfection, the Magnifier of all who are magnified by His knowledge, the Empowerer of all who are empowered by His might, the Satisfier of all who are satisfied by His good-pleasure, the Beloved of all who are beloved through His love, the Dawning-Place of all who receive light from His dawning, the Sovereign of all who receive sovereignty through His dominion, the King of all who receive kingship through His kingdom, the Exalted One of all who are exalted through His exaltation, the Munificent One to all who receive bounty through His munificence, the Bestower upon all who receive gifts through His bestowal, the Gracious One to all who receive grace through His grace, the Kind One to all who receive kindness through His kindness, the Manifest One to all who are manifested through His manifestation, the Hidden One to all who are hidden through His concealment, the Wondrous One to all who are made wondrous through His signs, the Pure One to all who are purified through His remembrance, the Deliverer of all who are delivered through His command, the Destroyer of all who are destroyed through His justice, the Compassionate One to all who receive compassion through His tenderness, the Clement One to all who receive clemency through His clemency, the Provider of all who are provided through His provision, the Bestower upon all who receive bestowals through His bounty, the Subduer of all who are subdued through His dominion. He hath ever been the Sovereign over all His names through the King of His power, and over all His attributes through the authority of His grace. His is all might and majesty in the past and in the future. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Deliverer.Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. And verily the glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon all who resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity\[...\]

And whoso resembleth that One, where naught can be seen therein save the First One. And furthermore, I testify that there is no deliverer except God alone, and that God, glorified be He, delivereth all His servants through the Manifestations of His Cause and His creation. Thus, whosoever delivereth anyone in the Bayan, this is from the effulgences of that Name until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Likewise, whosoever exalteth anyone from the first Point of the Bayan until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, this is from the effulgences of that Name. And thou art like unto this, so bear witness in all Names and bring down the Command in all similitudes. And if anyone on the Day of Resurrection delivereth another from grief in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, this is better for thee than all that thou hast done from the beginning of thy life unto its end. For if this reacheth Him Whom God shall make manifest, He will be pleased therewith and will attribute thy deed unto Himself and will make thee the manifestation of His Name 'the Deliverer' through His grace, when He willeth. But all that thou hast done, like all who are in the Bayan, seek thou on the Day of Resurrection to perform a deed that will exalt the Word of thy Lord and establish the Manifestation of thy Beloved in thy beginning and thine end. Otherwise, to draw nigh through what is in the Bayan - all at the end of the Manifestation like unto thee on that Day - is to draw nigh through drawing nigh unto the Command of God in His new Manifestation, if thou desirest to be of them that attain. Otherwise, do as thou pleasest, like those who were given the Book before thee, for thou shalt never succeed through thy knowledge on the Day of Resurrection unless thou workest for God in His new Manifestation as He willeth and commandeth thee. Verily, He is the All-Wise, the Subtle.And it hath four degrees. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Causative, the Most Causative. There is no God but He, the Most Causative, the Most Causative. Say: God is more causative than any possessor of causes. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His Cause. Verily, He hath ever been the Causer of causes. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down in adoration unto Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Sovereignty, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Rule and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

Exalted is He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He Who possesseth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God createth the cause and maketh it to be within His grasp, whomsoever He willeth of His servants. Will ye not then see? Say: Verily God causeth all things through His command. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but He, the Most Great, the Most Exalted. Say: Verily God maketh to flow for you the causes - the causes of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. Is there any god besides God who is able to create anything? Say: Glorified be God, exalted above what they mention. Say: Verily God is the Causer of every cause. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty, the Sovereign. Say: Verily God causeth the causes to flow without a cause and createth them anew even as He created them the first time. All are subservient unto Him, all worship Him. Say: Verily everything within its bounds is a cause for the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, but ye do not perceive. Were it not for the ink whose splendor...\[nothing would exist. How then do ye acquire what is ordained in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them? And by this ye preserve the measures of your religion until the Day of Resurrection.\] Say: Verily God loveth to make all that is on earth into one order, all ascending to the dawning-place of oneness and appearing from the horizon of oneness, that ye may on the Day of Resurrection believe in and be assured of Him Whom God shall make manifest. None hath been seen like unto Him in the heavens or on earth or in whatsoever lieth between them. Nothing can be likened unto Him, and verily He is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. None hath been seen to resemble Him in the heavens or on earth or in whatsoever lieth between them. Nothing can be likened unto Him, and verily He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and the kingdom, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and sovereignty, and glorified be God, the Lord of power and divinity, and glorified be God, the Lord of countenance and beauty, and glorified be God, the Lord of the face and perfection, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and action, and glorified be God, the Lord of mercy and bounty, and glorified be God, the Lord of authority and justice, and glorified be God, the Lord of similitude and examples, and glorified be God, the Lord of stations and majesty, and glorified be God, the Lord of grandeur and independence, and glorified be God, the Lord of glory and transcendence, and glorified be God, the Lord of might and inaccessibility, and glorified be God, the Lord of power and exaltation, and glorified be God, the Lord of joy and gladness, and glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and might, and glorified be God, the Lord of magnificent bounties, and glorified be God, the Lord of supreme examples, and glorified be God, the Lord of \[...\] the eternal, and glorified be God, the Lord of noble stations, and glorified be God, the Lord of gracious stations, and glorified be God, the Lord of ancient dawning-places, and glorified be God, the Lord of glorious setting-places, and glorified be God, the Lord of the most high example. He is the One Who created all things by His command. There is none other God but He, the Great, the Most Exalted, Who giveth life \[...\]

Glorified be God, possessor of the most exalted similitude! He is the One Who created all things by His command. There is no God but Him, the Great, the Most High. He gives life and causes death, and verily there is no God but Him, the One, the Majestic. To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them. There is no God but Him, the One, the Beautiful.Say: Who created the Bayan, if ye but knew? Say: God is the Creator of every cause without a cause, if ye but observe in the Primal Will. Say: Verily God creates all things through a cause, if ye but observe in the creation of all things through the Primal Will. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: God gives life and causes death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Ye are like unto lions, raising your voices in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest against those who believe not in your Lord and then in His proof, and ye stand firm like mountains. Say: God hath created you like unto lions that ye may cause all on earth to tremble in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, yet there ye prostrate yourselves like ants about to be seized.There all majesty equals not what passes through a gnat's wing, and We verily seek forgiveness for this with a mighty forgiveness. Say: There all grandeur equals not what passes through what passes from the passing of a gnat, and We verily seek God's forgiveness for this with a mighty forgiveness.Then before Him Whom God shall make manifest ye shall arise thus, and unto Him Whom He shall make manifest ye shall prostrate thus. But for others ye become as fearsome lions and swift runners. Thus doth God desire to train those who are in the Bayan, not like the sanctified ones who weep and make mention in their chambers night and day.Say: If ye were truthful in your weeping and your mention, how is it that God hath manifested the One ye mention, yet ye weep not for Him? The year of Ha hath passed, while ye remain in your chambers, delighting in what ye possess. Fear ye God and enter into God's religion with truth, and fear ye God and enter into God's religion with sincerity.God created you and whatsoever ye do. God provides for you and whatsoever ye possess. Can any besides God truly possess anything? Say: Glorified be God above what they describe. Every kingdom belongs to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all are mindful of Him. He it is Who gives life and causes death, and unto Him shall all be turned.His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Fearsome Lion.The Second in the Second.In the Name of God, the Most Causative, the Most Causative.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion \[...\]

Thine is the Kingdom and the might of the Empyrean, Thine is the power and the realm of divinity, Thine is the strength and the precious ruby, Thine is the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine is the majesty and the glory, Thine is the countenance and the beauty, Thine is the face and the perfection, Thine is the might and the action, Thine is the similitude and all parables, Thine is the station and all grandeur, Thine is the mercy and the bounty, Thine is the dominion and justice, Thine is the awe and the radiance, Thine is the glory and the invincibility, Thine is the power and the exaltation, Thine is the sovereignty and the omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, ever-living, all-sustaining, a sovereign, supreme, holy, everlasting, eternal, self-dependent, transcendent, and inaccessible. Thou hast never taken unto Thyself a consort nor a son, and there hath been no partner for Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them according to a measure. By Thy will Thou hast fashioned all things and formed them according to a design. Thou hast ever created all causes through their means and hast ordained the measures of all things according to what is in them and upon them. I testify unto Thee \[...\]

Praised be Thou, for Thou art the Cause of all causes, uncaused by any cause, and the Determiner of all destinies, undetermined by any destiny. For in every Dispensation, in the Manifestation of Thine Own Self, this mystery shineth forth and this remembrance beameth bright. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thine are the most excellent names from time immemorial unto time everlasting, and Thine are the most sublime examples in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. O my God! Do Thou regard the causes of all things for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, through what He hath created or shall create, by the sovereignty of Thy might, the dominion of Thy sanctity, the transcendence of Thine eternity, the power of Thy oneness, and the majesty of Thy glory. Thou art exalted above all through the sublimity of Thy Lordship and the supremacy of Thy sovereignty. For Thou art the Creator of all things without their thingness, and the Fashioner of their reality without limitation. How wondrous is Thy handiwork in the realm of Lordship, and how subtle Thy creation in the kingdom of sovereignty! Thou hast created the heavens without pillars upon the waters of praise, and Thou hast created all things as Thou didst please through Thy power. Thou hast ever been supreme over all contingent beings, manifest above all existing things, mighty over all created things, exalted above all atoms, sanctified above all who dwell in the kingdom of earth and heaven, transcendent above all who inhabit the realm of names and attributes, and sovereign over all that Thou hast created and brought into being through the sublime letters. How great is Thy craftsmanship, O Lord of might and majesty! How subtle is Thy handiwork, O Lord of beauty and glory! Cause Thou a cause for us from the treasuries of Thy mystery, and ordain for us a destiny from the storehouses of Thy grace. For verily Thou knowest what is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and Thou dost overshadow by Thy power all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them. Thou givest life and death, then death and life. Verily Thou wert existing before all things, and shalt exist after all things, and art supreme above all things, and art the Creator of all things, and art established over the reality of all things. Never shall Thy wonders cease to be, nor Thy bounties be numbered. Thou givest life and causeth death, then givest death and life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Supreme Cause of causes. Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and raised Himself in His elevation above all atoms, and sanctified Himself in His sanctity above all created things, and empowered Himself in His might above all existing things, and established His sovereignty in His dominion above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Supreme Cause, and nothing hath desired the cause of anything \[...\]

And whensoever a thing desireth to be the cause of something, and the means of that thing be not within its power except through that lofty discourse and exalted verse, God shall cause the means of that thing to flow unto it and shall gladden its eyes with whatsoever it desireth of those means. Verily He, exalted and glorified be He, hath ever been powerful over all things, encompassing all things, elevated above all things, and sanctified beyond all things. Not an atom escapeth His knowledge. He heareth those who call upon Him and answereth the prayers of those who turn unto Him through His most excellent names. Naught in all the kingdoms of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth between them can frustrate Him. Through His power He hath ever held sovereignty over all atoms, and through His knowledge encompassed all that dwelleth in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.Bear thou witness, after that Cause that is the Causer of causes and that Sovereign Who ruleth over all attributes, that God hath chosen for His Reality all things, and its essence is an impregnable substance, its abstraction sublime, its camphor resplendent, its pristine nature fresh, and its essential nature ethereal. Then did shine forth and beam and rise and spread abroad that which was manifested unto it through itself, whereupon the heaven and earth of all things were filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him. He hath made the Point of the Bayan the cause of all things that have been and shall be created, and through Him hath He created the means of all things as He willeth and according to His desire.Turn ye therefore unto Him through that Most Mighty, Most Ancient Cause, then unto the Sources of Primal Unity Most Exalted, then unto those who in that Night that is not night are guided and informed that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most Supreme Cause, the Fourth in the Fourth.In the Name of God, the Most Supreme, Most Supreme Cause. Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Most Supreme, Most Supreme Cause. And verily the Glory of God rest upon the First Unity and upon them that resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity.I testify that God, glorified be He, createth all things through a cause, and createth the cause through Himself. By the cause is meant the Primal Will, and by what is created through the cause is meant the conditions of that cause until the appearance of the end. When thou desirest something, look not to the means and the cause, but rather look to God Who created all things through the cause and created the cause without a cause. For this is the glory of unity and the sanctity of abstraction in the innermost sanctuary of the uniqueness of distinction and the essence of the uniqueness of praise. Yet be not veiled from the means, for God hath created all things and placed within them an effect. The dependence of all things upon all things is like the dependence of all things upon all things. For example, if thou desirest to write and thou puttest in place of ink the elixir of red, thou wilt not achieve the effect thou desirest, and likewise if thou puttest ink in place of the red elixir, thou wilt not achieve the effect thou desirest. Verily God createth all things through their cause \[...\]

Verily God createth all things through their means, and He causeth all means to flow through their channels. When thou prayest to God for any need, look unto its means and seek to attract it through its means, for God will grant thee this, albeit through its means. Look not unto the means nor the cause, but rather unto the Causer of causes, Who operateth not through means but Who causeth the means to operate through their channels. For if thou shouldst seclude thyself in a place and pray to God for that which thou desirest - God indeed knoweth thy desire and is able to fulfill it for thee by inspiring in the heart of a servant to come unto thee and grant thy request. But God hath not made this the measure for His servants. Rather, He hath given them knowledge and thought, and hath shown them the means to all things. Therefore seek all things through their means, and look unto none but God, for all means exist by God's command. And invoke God in all things through all things, for ye know not the circumstances of your affairs. Perchance the means may appear unto you, yet God hath not perfected them, so trust not in means, for death is in God's hands - He sendeth it down upon whomsoever He willeth, and from this ye are not secure.And it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Consequential, the Most Consequential. There is no God but He, the Most Consequential, the Most Consequential. Say: God is more consequential than every consequential one possessed of consequences. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the dominion of His consequential authority. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been consequential in His consequences. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Sapphire, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily your Lord shall advance you and hold you back, shall manifest you and conceal you, and shall show you the consequences of what hath been sent down from His presence, that ye may be assured of God's signs on the Day of Resurrection. That was the Night of Independence. We were indeed mindful of our Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, Lord of all things, Lord of the seen and the unseen, Lord of the worlds. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and then upon the exponents of His Cause in the Kingdom.

Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in the realm of sovereignty and dominion.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in might and grandeur.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in power and divinity.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in strength and glory.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in sovereignty and the human realm.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in honor and majesty.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in countenance and beauty.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in likeness and similitude.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in station and glory.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in strength and deed.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in mercy and bounty.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in authority and justice.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in dominion and sovereignty.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in rule and authority.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in might and invincibility.Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon the exponents of His Cause in power and exaltation.Glorified art Thou, O Lord!

Bestow Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon those who proclaim His Cause with joy and gladness. Glory be unto Thee! Send down Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and upon those who proclaim His Cause with sovereignty and power. That which hath been revealed from on high hath been presented before God, thy Lord, and verily We have been among those who hearken. Say: Praise be to God Who hath guided us in the Bayan unto the path of certain truth. This cannot be equaled by whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lies between them. This, verily, is the supreme bounty.That which thou hast mentioned concerning the letters of the Bismillah from aforetime in the Furqan - all have believed in them. Therefore make mention of Muhammad in the Point, then the witnesses of His Self, then the Most Glorious Leaf, then the Gates of the Quarters in the first Occultation, then the mention of thy Lord's Name, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We shall indeed give thee the Balance of Guidance that thou mayest be among the guided ones in the days of God.The likeness of the Letters of the Unity is as the likeness of those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest before all others believe, and whosoever believeth in Him is a Letter of Truth, and they shall be remembered before their Lord for their precedence in faith. And that which thou hast mentioned concerning the Letters of the Living - after the Point they are all of the number of Unity. Naught can be seen in all of that save the Primal Unity, all standing firm by God's command from His presence.And concerning what thou hast mentioned about the Unity of the Bayan - there existed no manifest proof upon the earth during the manifestation of the Point besides these who all stood firm. Was there in the days of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, any proof besides Him? Say: Glory be to God above what they mention! Verily, all those whom Muhammad commanded to love and obey in His days were proofs from Muhammad, as He had mentioned them from God. Ye shall witness in the days of God hereafter even as was ordained aforetime.Those who knew God, thy Lord, before all others who know - these are they whom God hath mentioned in the Book and commanded you to love. O all things! Ye shall surely love them. Among them are some who have fulfilled their love and some who wait, and all return unto God their Lord. When the Sun shineth forth, ye are commanded only to obey it. Thereafter ye shall witness what is ordained for you.Should God wish, He would establish for you, and should He wish, He would command you through true witnesses from His presence. God ordaineth what He pleaseth and decreeth what He willeth. How many Messengers have We sent down from Our presence to the worlds, and how many servants have We mentioned with mighty and glorious mention! All are remembered within their bounds and all are praised in their stations of remembrance.Blessed are they who follow the Seven Letters from Our presence and who believe in the mention of the All-Merciful. Know ye therefore the measure of what is mentioned in those days of your Lord, for this is of God's bounty unto you, that ye might be thankful. God shall soon reveal unto His servants that which they cannot comprehend in knowledge, that they might give thanks in the days of their Lord. Say: The names of those who believed in the Point before all others begin with the number of the Name of the Manifestation \[...\]

God shall soon send down upon His servants that which they cannot comprehend, that they may be thankful in the days of their Lord. Say: The names of those who have believed in the Point are, in number, first equal to the number of the name of the Manifestation, and last equal to the number of the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. Ye shall in that Day be remembered through their love. Through that First Unity hath God created all numbers, as ye are guided by God's guidance. The likeness of the First Unity is as mirrors facing the Sun of Heaven, and those that face after it do face thereby. All that thou seest in the Bayan are mirrors, for they believe in God and His signs. Remember thou one who writeth God's verses before Him, for that is what thou art commanded to love. Say: All such as these are mentioned in God's Book. And verily what thou hast mentioned about the seat of the Gate, after God had raised him unto Himself - ye cannot comprehend it save on the Day of Resurrection. Those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest - that is His seat, as ye shall there behold. Set no limits to God's Cause, for if God should choose infinite numbers, all are chosen by God's command, and if He should choose praiseworthy numbers, all are chosen by God's command, and if He should enumerate the Cause, they are chosen by God's command. All guide unto thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and all are names of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. The first ones hath God brought before Him by His command and made them know Himself, and when God said unto them: "Am I not your Lord and the Lord of all things?" they replied: "Yea, and by our Lord, the Merciful, we all believe in Thee and in Thy signs." Glory be unto Thee, O God! There is no God but Thee. Thou hast sent down Thy verses upon Thy servant. We all believe in Thee and in Thy signs from him whom Thou hast chosen for Thy Cause. Behold how many Bismillahs We are revealing - for each letter a temple, nay, according to the number of letters of each one of them, all in the Book guiding unto the truth that there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Consider how in the mention of the name of the name Majid, how God hath subjected under its shadow four hundred thousand numbers, and if it were not guiding unto God, the Lord of the worlds, were such numbers of temples to be under the shadow of the letters of any of God's creation, how then should they be under the shadow of the name of thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting? Were all on earth to gather under the shadow of the Point, it would encompass all that through His command. Set no limits to God's Cause. Consider how many in Islam have taken shelter under Muhammad's shadow. This is what a single point of the letters beareth. Ye look unto the loftiness of God's Cause. Remember ye a pure leaf - they said she had believed in God and His signs among the first numbers, as she had believed in God and His signs when she said: "Yea, I am assured of God and His signs." On the Day of Resurrection there shall be no ties of kinship between you - ye shall be judged by your faith. Reflect ye on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - those who believe in Him in the numbers of Unity, these are mentioned in God's Book. If He willeth, He shall make them \[...\]

And on the Day of Resurrection there shall be no ties of kinship between you; by your faith shall ye be judged. Reflect ye upon the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, those who believe in Him to the number of the Unity - these are they who are mentioned in the Book of God. Should He wish, He would make them the First Unity, and should He choose, He would select from among His friends the number of the Unity. Say: all stand ready at God's bidding, and we all beseech God's grace. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God! Send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, then upon the numbers of the Living One in whom they believe, then upon those who follow these numbers, they who believe in God and His verses through His Proof. Verily the Prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs and the believers are all alive in the presence of God, and they believe in that which God hath revealed in the Bayan. And when God hath made Himself known unto thee, ask not of those who are created.

By His command, and by the command of God, they stand steadfast in their stations. When the sun sets, behold those who judge by what was revealed in the Bayan, that ye may be guided. These are they who follow naught but the knowledge of truth, and in their testimony they do not speak vainly. They say not "This is what our souls perceive," but rather "This is what was revealed in the Bayan." God hath made our religion spacious for us and hath made clear to us the measure of all things. We are all His worshippers.And concerning what thou didst mention about the Return, verily We are the Answerers. All the numbers of the Unity have returned through the manifestation of the Point, for all return unto It. That is the gathering place of all gatherings, and ye all bear witness to the Primal Unity, then ye are convinced of Its manifestations by His command. And concerning what thou didst mention about the praised numbers returning as one number - yea, God thy Lord shall cause them to return and shall raise them up. Yea, by thy Lord, the All-Protecting! This is like what Muhammad said aforetime: "Verily I am all the Prophets," and then "all the Successors," and what was mentioned from His presence. But ye look to the mystery of the Cause.In every Revelation, when that which ye manifest appears greater in your eyes, therefore He Whom God shall make manifest will announce to you afterwards the names of what appeared before, if ye would but reflect. That future abode is greater than the first life, and its people are greater, if ye would bear witness to the truth. On the day when God raised up Muhammad, the people in their own eyes greatly magnified Jesus. Therefore He informed them of His mention of Himself, and likewise before Jesus in Moses, and thus do ye witness until the wondrous First Day.The example of the Sun of Truth is like the sun in the heaven - were God to cause it to rise without limit, ye would still witness but one sun. Likewise its radiance, which is the Command of the Sun of Manifestation - in all dispensations ye witness one Command. However, Its manifestations differ, and ye magnify what appears in your own dispensation. Therefore, all that appears afterwards mentions to you the names of His Self that came before, that perchance ye may magnify the Cause of God.If We willed, We would raise up all the Prophets from a single soul - verily We are powerful over that. And if We willed, We would raise up all the martyrs from a single soul - verily We are powerful over that. And if We willed, We would raise up all the believers from a single soul - verily We are powerful over that. Say: By what command do the Prophets stand? Then by what command do the Successors stand? Then by what command do the martyrs stand? Then by what command do the believers stand? Say: All stand by God's command from the presence of the Sun of Truth, and these are the physical signs from God in Its grasp. Do ye not see?And likewise in the shadow, if We willed, We would raise up all the letters of negation in one letter - ye would utterly destroy that letter. And if We willed, We would multiply that - ye would seek refuge with God your Lord. And the negation of every soul facing it - ye all witness within its bounds. The negation of whosoever is upon that earth who opposed It aforetime without right, then every soul witnesseth within its bounds.

Verily, the negation of every soul is in respect to itself, as ye all within your bounds do witness. The negation of whomsoever is upon the earth is in relation to him who opposeth him without right, as ye all within your bounds do witness. And verily, the negation of him who opposeth the Point of Truth is other than the negation of him who opposeth the numbers of the First Unity, if ye be of them that truly witness. And verily, the negation of those who have believed, each according to their degree - if there be in the East of the earth two weak women, one of whom hath believed in what was revealed in the Bayan and the other hath not believed in the verses of her Lord, then verily she is a negation in relation to herself, as ye all within your bounds do witness. And perchance there may be a negation in relation to affirmative numbers, or an affirmation of one in relation to negative numbers, as ye all within your bounds do witness. And verily, the believers and others in every Dispensation - perchance one may believe in the Cause of his Lord through him whom God hath chosen, but all are possessed of human form upon the earth, and all are believers in what God hath ordained for them in their religion. Is there aught that doth not glorify God, its Lord? Say: Glory be to God, exalted be His majesty! All do glorify their Lord with praise, and all act for God, their Lord. Know ye that those who act in the First Manifestation, if they enter not into the Later Manifestation, God will render them and their deeds as dust. Say: O all things! Guard yourselves against this. And verily, what I have mentioned concerning the Gate of Guidance - all call unto God their Lord in the Bayan, and these are they who do good. And verily, some are exalted above others in their guidance and their piety in the Book of God, and all shall attain until the Day of Resurrection. On that Day, if ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, these are they who shall receive a double reward, but if not, their deeds shall be rendered void before their Lord and they shall not be helped. And verily, what I have mentioned concerning the letters of "In the Name of God, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous," and concerning the numbers of the Unity, and concerning the numbers of the Living after the Point, and concerning those who have preceded in the Cause of their Lord - all are proofs of God that there is no God but Him, the One, the Sovereign. I have informed thee concerning the name of creation and what numberless multitudes take shelter beneath its shade - how then could numbers suffice for those who take shelter beneath the names of thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting? We commanded thee only to love the First Unity, then all who are in the Bayan as believers - love them in the religion of God and bear witness that they are guided by the guidance of the First One. These are they who have tasted in the holy gardens from the gardens of His verses before those who would taste, and for all are degrees with their Lord, and all are devoutly obedient unto Him. And verily, after the number of Unity, the numbers of thy Lord's proofs cannot be counted, and God shall fill the whole earth with the numbers of the Bayan, for He is powerful over all things. Say: Weaken not yourselves in your religion, but be like mountains which none with wings can surmount due to your loftiness, for this is how ye shall be elevated on the Day of Resurrection.

And be ye like unto mountains which none with wings can scale, such is your loftiness, for this is how ye shall be exalted on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, from the first year of the Bayan it was mentioned that ye shall reckon the fifth day of the first Jim of your month as the first of eternal years. Then shall ye count each month, and thereafter ye shall decrease what exceeds, counting nineteen days in each month and nineteen months in each year, and in each cycle three hundred and sixty plus one - thus shall ye reckon. Be not guided by the rising of the moon, nor by what ye calculate by the sun. We have ordained for you that wherein ye differed, that ye may be grateful in God's religion. Yet at the beginning of each month, facing the moon, ye shall say: "Verily the glory from God be upon thee, O thou luminous Moon, in every time, and before time, and after time." And verily there hath been mentioned one whose name equateth in number the name of the beloved Qaim. Say: preserve this with thee, and if thou art able, manifest through it a trace in the world in the path of mentioning the name of thy Lord, the Other, against him who without right hath grown proud against Him. This is of God's bounty unto thee and unto the God-fearing. Fear ye God, your Lord, in your journey and your dwelling, then upon God, your Lord, shall ye rely. Then in God's days, by night and by day, shall ye glorify Him. And verily this is like... a measure from the gardens when it taketh its essence becoming a measure of beloved perfume. Thus doth He show you the resurrection of a thousand in one, and above that like that, and below this like this, if ye bear true witness. And verily this is a tradition which ye mention: Whoso desireth to behold the countenance of Adam unto Muhammad, let him behold the countenance of Muhammad Mahdi, the true, the beloved. Likewise, whoso desireth to behold His countenance - every believer from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end - let him behold the countenance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for the glory of all is in Him. Say: Glorified be God above that with a mighty glorification. Say: This is the Face of God and all else is His creation, and all are worshippers of Him. And His are the stations of the First in the First. In the Name of God, the Most Ordaining of ordainers. Say: God is more ordaining than any ordainer. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can withstand the power of the King, the Sovereign of His ordinance. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Ordainer, the Most Ordaining, the Supreme Ordainer. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the dominion and the Kingdom and the might \[...\]

All praise, majesty and dominion, then glory and grandeur, then power and divinity, then might and magnificence, then sovereignty and the human realm, are His. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, a King Who fadeth not, a Justice without limits, a Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Verily He shall send down from His presence the measure of all things by His command "Be," and it is. God beareth witness that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. This Book containeth the grief of one who hath been raised unto God, his Lord, a remembrance from His presence. Verily there is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God will surely console thee with goodly consolation, for he hath attained unto the presence of his Lord and was a beauteous light. Say: This is from God's grace upon him and upon those who have ascended unto God their Lord. Blessed are they and that which they shall attain from their Lord. They are now in Paradise, reclining upon their couches, having before them whatsoever their souls desire, and God increaseth for them from His presence. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Verily I am God, there is none other God but I, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. I created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, loved thee, and made thee a sign for those who profess the unity of God. Therefore abide thou in tranquility from God's presence, and be patient in thy Lord's path with beauteous patience, and cherish what hath been given thee from His presence, for this is a mighty remembrance. We have raised it to the highest horizon, We have mentioned it in the Garden of Refuge, We have made it the Primary Letters, and We have ordained for it what We willed in the Hereafter and the first life. This is from God's grace upon him and upon thee and upon those who are related to you both, a bounty from His presence. Verily He is the Most High, the Most Great. The heavens are nigh to being rent asunder, the earth to being cleft, and the mountains to falling in ruins, by reason of what hath been decreed for those of old and those of latter times. Therefore be tranquil, O all things, then be patient, for they have attained unto the presence of their Lord and they rejoice in their stations in Paradise. And when ye remember what hath been decreed for them, We shall surely give you double what hath been ordained for you - ye, O all things, shall attain unto this bounty. Say: Verily He Who created him before hath ordained his elevation. We were indeed submissive unto Him. We are all from God and we all begin from God. We are all for God and unto Him do we all return. Blessed is he whom God, thy Lord, hath joined, and she who is thy sister - both of them from the Letters\[...\]

And she who is thy sister, both being of the letters, and the first of whom is inscribed in the Mother Book - let her find repose in God Who hath created her, for all find their rest in God. Let her be patient through God Who hath provided for her, for all are patient through God. Let her remember her Lord, for all are mindful of Him. Let her worship her Lord at all times, before all times and after all times, for God shall unite her with Him in the life to come, in the most exalted Paradise near the mighty throne. God, thy Lord, shall grant thee that which shall gladden thy heart, for He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.Say: Glory be to Thee, O God!

Send Thy blessings upon the Essence of the Seven Letters and the Exponents of His Cause through gladness and joy. Glory be to Thee, O God! Send Thy blessings upon the Essence of the Seven Letters and the Exponents of His Cause through sovereignty and power.From the time when God first created all things until this moment, no such consolation hath been sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Indeed, a single letter thereof is worth more than all that is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. And God is mighty, well-beloved.Recite ye the verses of God by night and by day, for this is the supreme bounty. Look ye unto that which hath been sent down from God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Verily in the Bayan is that through which ye shall find repose, and in the Bayan is that through which ye shall be glorified, and in the Bayan is that through which ye shall be adorned, and in the Bayan is that through which ye shall be magnified.

Verily, in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall be exalted, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain knowledge, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall be illumined, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall be strengthened, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain dominion, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain sovereignty, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain wisdom, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain power, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall be purified, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall find relief, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall gain patience, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall glorify God, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall sanctify yourselves, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall offer praise, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall proclaim His unity, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall magnify Him, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall be freed from all sorrow, and in the Bayan is that whereby ye shall attain unto all good.God hath sent down therein the detailed exposition of all things as a guidance and a reminder unto all the worlds. There is nothing that He hath created or will create but its mention and explanation hath been revealed therein in the most perfect manner that ye could desire, wherein ye may find full exposition. But they who have been given knowledge from God - these are they who understand; and they who have not been given knowledge from God - these are they who comprehend not the import of what We have revealed therein, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall not return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest in truth.Say: God hath created naught but that ye should worship Him and be assured of His signs. This is the essence of your knowledge in your beginning and your end, in all your conditions of negation and affirmation, if ye bear witness unto the truth. Say: All this shall God cause to return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. Do ye not, then, believe in the signs of God?Give thanks, therefore, unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful, for having guided you unto the true Faith wherein ye shall not differ. Ye have heard in the tradition how the Angel of Truth proclaimeth from God: "Verily, the truth is with your Qa'im," and all hear that voice. He Who calleth you unto God - all know that He calleth unto God, the True One, and all hear His voice. Then through the shadow upon shadow in the shadow do ye seek guidance.He loveth not that ye should be mentioned by them that believe not in God and His signs, and God will assuredly seize them by His command. Verily, He is the Subduer, the Mighty. His is all that is in the heavens and on earth and all that is between them, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. He it is Who created you and whatsoever ye do, and He it is Who nourished you in your mothers' wombs, fashioning you according to His will as He pleaseth by His command. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He it is Who fashioneth the pearls in their shells in the depths of the sea. Will ye not, then, believe in the signs of God?

And whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. He it is Who fashioneth the pearls within their shells in the depths of the ocean. Will ye not, then, be assured of the signs of God? He it is Who hath made subject unto His command the sun and the moon and the stars. His, verily, is all creation and authority, both aforetime and hereafter. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He it is Who sendeth down water from the heaven in such measure as He hath ordained, wherewith ye till the earth and from which ye drink. This is a bounty from God unto you, that ye might be thankful. He it is Who hath made the heaven to be above you and the earth beneath your feet, that ye might work for God, your Lord. He it is Who hath sent down the Book in truth, that ye might be guided by the signs of God. He it is Who showeth you His signs - will ye not then glorify Him? Say: Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and kingdom! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and power! Glorified be God, the Lord of strength and divinity! Glorified be God, the Lord of force and majesty! Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and the world of nature! Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and grandeur! Glorified be God, the Lord of countenance and beauty! Glorified be He, the Lord of face and perfection! Glorified be God, the Lord of similitude and example! Glorified be God, the Lord of station and sublimity! Glorified be God, the Lord of greatness and independence! Glorified be God, the Lord of majesty and transcendence! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and inaccessibility! Glorified be God, the Lord of power and exaltation! Glorified be God, Who is the Lord of gladness and joy! Glorified be He, the Lord of authority and elevation! He it is before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Great, the Most High. He it is Whom all glorify who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious. Unto God belongeth the splendor of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most resplendent of the resplendent. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most grand of the grand. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most beautiful of the beautiful. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most majestic of the majestic. Unto God belongeth the light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most luminous of the luminous. Unto God belongeth the mercy of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most merciful of the merciful. Unto God belong the words of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most wise of the wise. Unto God belong the names of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the greatest of the great. Unto God belongeth the might of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the mightiest of the mighty. Unto God belongeth the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the most knowing of the knowing. Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens \[...\]

Unto God belongeth the power of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Unto God belongeth the good-pleasure of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Well-Pleased, the All-Pleasing, the Most Pleasing. Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Loving, the Most Loving, the Best-Beloved.

Unto God belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Supreme Ruler, the Sovereign, the Most Powerful. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Lord of All, the Supreme Master, the King. Unto God belongeth the loftiness of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the All-High, the Most High.They who recite these verses by night and by day, God will surely grant them the good of the hereafter and of this world, from His presence. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Excellent. These are verses of the number of Unity. When ye hear them with spirit and joy, ye shall acknowledge them, through them ye shall comprehend all glory, through them ye shall possess all good. This is of God's grace unto them that are in the Bayan and are assured of God and His signs.Unto Him submit whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All shall return unto Him. Before Him prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and all are turned unto God. Say: In His hand is the kingdom of all things, if ye but knew it. Say: In God's hand, Who created the heavens and the earth by His command "Be!" and it is. God giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. He it is Who originateth the creation of all things. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Unto God belongeth the love of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are drawn by Him. Unto God belongeth the right hand of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: Through Him do they love, through God's grace do they comprehend.

Unto God belongeth the command of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All shall return unto God their Lord.And whenever ye are grieved by aught, say: "Sufficient unto us is God Who hath created us, and in God let the faithful put their trust." Then shall ye return with God's blessing and grace, untouched by what could grieve you, and God shall be pleased with what pleaseth you from His presence. Verily, He hath power over all things. This is of God's grace unto whosoever is in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, He is knowing of all things. Say: Who originated the creation of the heavens \[...\]

He verily knoweth all things between them. Say: Who initiated the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and Who will cause them to return? They will surely answer: God. Say: How then do ye fail to believe in Him upon Whom God hath sent down His verses? Say: Whoso is guided, is guided for his own sake, and whoso remaineth veiled, remaineth so to his own loss. And God is wholly independent of all the worlds.And it hath four stations. The first station of the first is: In the Name of God, the Most Orderly, the Most Orderly. There is no God but He, the Most Orderly, the Most Orderly. Say: God is more orderly than any possessor of order. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape the sovereignty of His command. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Orderly, the All-Perfect.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down in adoration unto Him. And praise be to God, unto Whom offer praise all who are in the heavens and who are on earth. Say: All stand obedient before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, if ye have knowledge? They will surely answer. Say: How then do ye not believe in Him upon Whom God hath sent down His verses? Say: Unto Whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them, if ye bear witness? They will surely answer: God. Say: How then do ye not attain certitude in Him upon Whom God hath sent down His verses? And how do ye seek to prevent what God hath ordained for Him from His presence?Say: Ye know not your beginning nor your end, else ye would not have remained veiled in the days of God. Say: We have indeed originated you and your religion aforetime, but on that day ye knew it not. That is the Day of Resurrection, but ye fail to witness it. Say: Ye have no way in your religion except that when ye hear the verses of God ye should attain certitude through them by means of five proofs that were decreed aforetime in the Book and are with those endowed with knowledge. Will ye not then remember?It hath been revealed in the Qur'an that none but God can bring forth a verse. How then do ye, after hearing and beholding these verses by God's command, fail to attain certitude, if ye truly believe in what God hath revealed aforetime?

Ye regard these verses of God, yet fail to attain certitude, though ye profess belief in that which God hath revealed aforetime. Were such utterance possible to any besides Him, wherefore in all the years from the revelation of the Qur'an until the year of deprivation have ye witnessed no sign from any soul? Say: Nay, by God! Who besides God could reveal a single verse? Yet ye remain veiled from that which God hath willed. Say: God proved His religion of Muhammad in the Qur'an only through your inability to produce verses like unto it, if ye be of the truthful. How is it ye bring not forth a verse, and after witnessing your own powerlessness, how is it ye believe not? Say: Should all who dwell on earth gather together to produce the like of a single verse We have sent down in this Book, they would fail and prove powerless, even were they the most learned among men. Say: If ye doubt this, then bring forth a verse - yet ye cannot and are powerless, even were ye the most capable on earth. Thus doth God demonstrate your impotence and establish His verses in the Book for those endowed with knowledge who believe in God and His signs. Say: If ye claim one proof sufficeth not, how is it ye believe not in what God revealed aforetime in the Surih of the Spider? This was sent down by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. "Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Book which is recited to them? Verily in this is a mercy and a reminder to people who believe." If ye believed in this before, then upon hearing God's verses ye would now believe in truth. Say: These verses are greater than the verses of all the Prophets combined. Were God's verses in the Qur'an not greater, He would not have abrogated through them what was revealed to previous Prophets of their religion. Yet ye reflect not upon God's verses nor wish to be guided. Say: When one desires to enter your religion, how do ye prove it? Have ye any proof besides the Qur'an? Little do ye remember! When all that ye relate and claim that none who wishes to enter your religion shall be heard except he witness a manifest proof that renders all the world powerless - yet God's proof is the Qur'an, before which all are powerless. Through it did God establish the religion of Islam before, and through it did He manifest the succession of those who were witnesses after the Messenger. Yet ye remain veiled from your beginning and your end. If ye say your proof through the Qur'an is incomplete for those who wish not to enter Islam, how then shall God question humanity after revealing the Qur'an that ye are in the religion \[...\]

In truth, you shall not enter, for the proof of your Lord hath been completed through the Qur'an against those who entered not Islam after it was perfected in the sight of God and those endowed with knowledge. How then will you, on that Day, fail to enter into the true religion through the Bayan? Say: We desire naught but to guide you, were you but believers in God's signs. Even as in your first life you were not among those endowed with knowledge who believed, after your death you shall surely witness that whereof you were warned. Fear ye God in the days of Truth, then be ye God-fearing. Verily, the example of the Truth is as the example of Muhammad's appearance to those servants who were promised in the name of Ahmad. But when He came to them with clear proofs from their Lord, they remained expectant. Likewise were those who were promised Muhammad in the latter days, after God had sent down verses in truth, yet they await in vain. Say: This is the Day of Resurrection wherein you all shall be brought before God, your Lord, even as you turn away from your Lord's proof. Some among you believe, while others believe not. From the beginning of your lives until their end you labored that God might be pleased with you, your Lord, that you might enter Paradise after death. But can His good-pleasure be manifested save through His Proof? How then do you ponder upon your own creation while you observe night and day? Say: God is indeed independent of all that is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, but ye are in need of God's guidance. Unless God guide you, ye cannot guide yourselves. He who turns to the words of the true Imams - from him are ye veiled, though ye imagine yourselves sincere in your religion. Nay, by no means! Can one possessed of clear proof from his Lord, manifesting such verses as leave all worlds powerless, be compared to one who cannot produce the like thereof? Why do ye not reflect? Say: That which God revealed aforetime to Muhammad over twenty-three years - ye read it not in those days. Should God so will, He would reveal unto me in a day and night that which, if ye doubt, then come ye into God's presence and bear witness. Say: Those who hear God's verses on the first day are indeed tried. Those who have believed in the Truth and were sincere for God's sake - these are they who shall triumph with God. But those who heard God's verses on the first day yet believed not in God's Cause are like those beforetime who were given knowledge yet remained veiled from what God had revealed concerning their religion. We have explained their mention in their religion, for they cannot muster proofs of their faith unless they believe in God and His signs and are certain of the Truth. Thus have they no proof before their Lord save that they say: "Glory be to Thee, O God! Forgive us and turn unto us, for Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. Thou art independent of all that is in the heavens \[...\]"

Turn Thou toward us, for verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. Thou wert independent of all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. They who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs - these are they upon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy grace and whom Thou hast numbered among Thy guided servants. Verily those who were veiled from meeting Thee on the Day of Resurrection, after what was revealed in the Furqan aforetime - these are they against whom Thy proof hath been completed. If Thou shouldst judge them with justice - verily Thou art the Most Just of the just. And if Thou shouldst forgive them through Thy grace - verily Thou art the Most Excellent of the excellent ones.Glory be unto Thee, O God! Thou dost guide all who are in Islam unto the path of certain truth. Thou didst bring them forth aforetime through Thy command "Be!" and Thou wilt cause them to return unto Thee through Thy command. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Orderly of the Most OrderlyGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Glory and the Might, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Sovereignty, Thine the Grandeur and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Similitudes, Thine the Stations and the Sublimity, Thine the Strength and the Action, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Authority and the Justice, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Pride and the Splendor, Thine the Might and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been before all things, and wilt ever be after all things, and art the Creator of all things, and the Essence after all things. Not an atom escapeth Thy knowledge in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them, nor is anything impossible for Thee in the Kingdom of Command or Creation or whatsoever lieth beneath them. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Powerful, Holy, Everlasting, Invincible, Transcendent, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hast Thou any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Through Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them according to a measure. Through Thy will Thou hast fashioned all things and formed them according to a form.Glory be unto Thee and exalted art Thou! Hallowed be all Thy names and exalted be Thy likenesses in all that pertaineth to them and is upon them. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou hast power over all things.Therefore, O God, send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with the signs of Thy power, with the Most Splendid of all Thy Splendors.

O God! Send down Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with the signs of Thy power - the Most Splendid of all Thy splendor, the Most Majestic of all Thy majesty, the Most Beautiful of all Thy beauty, the Most Grand of all Thy grandeur, the Most Luminous of all Thy light, the Most Merciful of all Thy mercy, the Most Perfect of all Thy words, the Greatest of all Thy names, the Most Glorious of all Thy glory, the Most Potent of all Thy will, the Most Penetrating of all Thy knowledge, the Most Powerful of all Thy might, the Most Pleasing of all Thy utterance, the Most Noble of all Thy nobility, the Most Enduring of all Thy sovereignty, the Most Exalted of all Thy exaltation, the Most Generous of all Thy signs, and of all that Thou art in Thy names and attributes, that which befitteth the sublimity of Thy holiness, the elevation of Thy glory, the expansion of Thy mercy, the invincibility of Thy Word, and the joy of Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Munificent, the Kind, verily Thou art the Bestower, the Gracious.Praise be to God Who hath risen in His ascendancy above all contingent things, Who hath elevated Himself in His exaltation above all created things, Who hath made Himself invincible in His might above all existing things, Who hath manifested Himself in His revelation above all atoms, and Who hath demonstrated His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling.He hath chosen an impregnable Essence, a resplendent Abstraction, a pristine Reality, an essential Camphor-like Nature, and an ornate Identity. Then He revealed Himself to it through it by itself and cast into its essence the likeness of its own being. Thus were His signs made manifest through it and His heavens and earth were filled thereby - verily there is none other God but Him, the One, the Luminous.The creation of what He hath created hath returned by His command, and the creation of what He hath fashioned hath been originated by what He hath sent down in His Book. I praise Him with praise wherewith none of His creation hath praised Him, and I thank Him with thanks wherewith none of His servants hath thanked Him, for having made us recognize His Self on the day of His manifestation and guided us to His religion through the signs of His concealment.Unto Him be praise - radiant praise shining forth from the horizon of sanctity and glory, and rising from the precincts of might and beauty - praise that filleth the heavens with the manifestations of His mercy and the earth with the wonders of His bounty, and all that lieth between them and beneath them, as befitteth the sublimity of His mighty glory and the exaltation of His august majesty, that all may testify that there is none other God but Him.He hath sent down in the Bayan the measures of all things, verifying that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word, through whom He hath manifested whatsoever He hath willed of the paths of His Cause and the wonders of His remembrance, that all may testify that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Originating.Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Most Great, the Most Great. And verily all glory from God be upon the Primal Unity.

Verily, the glory from God be upon the First One and upon him who resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. And furthermore, I testify that God, glorified be He, hath ordained the ways of all things through the wondrous crafting of His wisdom and the ordering system of the kingdom of His power. Nothing is seen except that it, through its own essence, indicateth His transcendent oneness and exalted eternality. He hath ordained for all His creation wondrous systems in their transformation and formation, and none can reckon what He hath manifested of the systems of His wondrous creation and the crafting of His marvelous Command.And thou, according to thy capacity in the balance of thy cause and the ordering of thy secret and manifest affairs in thy turning to God thy Lord, and what God hath manifested unto thee from His presence of the stations of His Cause and the manifestations of His grace - observe thou all things with the eye of truth. For in all existence there is but a single thread by which all are moved and stilled. This is the Command of God from the Manifestation of His Self in every Revelation, that thou shouldst not be veiled in a later Revelation by the former one, for that which is manifest in them is one Command from God, glorified be He.Therefore, in every Revelation, He causeth the dwellers of the previous Revelation not to enter into the subsequent Revelation since it profiteth them not, and they are judged as being without truth. For the likeness of such creation is as mirrors, and the likeness of what appeareth in the Revelations is as the sun - were God to cause it to rise endlessly, it would still be one sun. Likewise, were God to manifest endlessly the Primary Manifestations from His presence, that which is manifest in them would be one Command.Thus hath it been revealed in the tradition regarding the mention of the Proof: "Whoso desireth to behold from Adam to the Seal, let him behold Him," for all stand by one Command, and that Command is with Him. Nay, the Command is more exalted and sublime in the view of one who looketh with the eye of unity, for such an observer seeth naught save the Face of God, and thus speaketh not of created limitations.Similarly, perceive thou the shadow through the shadow, and seek assistance through God and His most beautiful Names, that thou mayest be, on the Day of Resurrection, among the believers. Remember thou God, thy Lord, in every moment, before every moment, and after every moment. And send thou blessings upon the guides of His Cause in every condition, before every condition, and after every condition.And it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme. There is no God but He, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme. Say: God is more supreme than every possessor of supremacy. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His supreme authority. He createth what He willeth by His Command. Verily, He hath ever been a Supreme Writer, writing supremely. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrating before Him. And praise be to God before Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Praise be unto God, Whom all things in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are humbly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall ordain the destinies of all things for you. Will ye not then be thankful? Say: That which the Tree of Truth writeth is that which God hath written for you. Will ye not then love to behold what God hath written? Say: That which He Whom God shall make manifest writeth is that which God, your Lord, writeth for you. Do ye not then believe with certainty in that which God had written for you before the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them? Say: Yea, by our Lord, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting! We are believers in that which is written. There is no altering the command of God. This is what the Point of the Bayan hath written in His latter days, and verily we all believe in His beginning and His end.Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a radiant portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection an illustrious portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a beauteous portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a mighty portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a luminous portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection an exalted portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a glorious portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection an impregnable portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection an all-encompassing portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a well-pleasing portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection an authoritative portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a sovereign portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a gracious portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a transcendent portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection a generous portion.O people of the Bayan! Ye must needs teach your children your steps, the greatest among them in your sight, for verily ye shall, through this, be glorified before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection. That which He Whom God shall make manifest writeth is better than what all writers have written, or what all writers had written before in relation to His own Self, not according to that which ye witness. Say: Verily God \[...\]

Our Lord, the All-Preserving, the Self-Subsisting, verily We believe in that which is written. There is no altering the decree of God - thus did the Point of the Bayan write in the latter days, verily We all believe in the beginning and in the end. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a resplendent portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a glorious portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a beauteous portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a mighty portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a luminous portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection an exalted portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a powerful portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection an impregnable portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection an all-encompassing portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a pleasing portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a sovereign portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a royal portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a gracious portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a transcendent portion. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Grant unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection a generous portion.O people of the Bayan! Know ye that your penmanship and calligraphy, even the most excellent among you, will on the Day of Resurrection bring you glory before your Lord. That which He Whom God shall make manifest shall write is better than what all scribes have written or shall write before, when attributed to His own Self, not as ye perceive. Say: God hath bestowed upon you knowledge and penmanship wherein ye take pride. Write ye what is revealed from His presence, else it is not permissible for you to inscribe even a dot. God hath created you and your writing that ye may write in the path of God. Whoso writeth a verse of the Bayan in the most beautiful script shall be admitted by God into Paradise through His bounty. He is verily the Supreme, the Beloved.Say: A single letter from the Point of the First cannot be equaled by all the books on earth. Ye are the Book of God, that ye may be glorified. Should He Whom God shall make manifest write unto you, that is greater in God's sight than if all on earth were to write unto you, for all creation and their writings are but created things before Him Whom God shall make manifest and His writings. Ponder ye upon this command and understand it. Should anyone possess all that is on earth, yet be offered but a single line from Him Whom God shall make manifest, he would indeed be blessed in receiving it and exalted in possessing it. This is from God's bounty, that ye may know the worth of the words of God. Were this to come from the Tree of Truth, its worth would be the same in God's sight - nay, greater still is His own worth. Will ye not then be assured of this? Be ye assured, then prostrate yourselves before Him, and train your children from their youth in the art of beautiful penmanship, learning from those who write in the most impregnable glory and display the finest craftsmanship.

Glorified art Thou, O Lord! Bless him who hath taught me the most impenetrable calligraphy from Thee, through that which Thou hast encompassed with Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Encompasser of all things. Say: Until now God hath not caused the Sun of Truth to rise upon such a noble and attractive script as hath dawned in this Dispensation, and bestowed upon him a noble and beloved calligraphy. This is of God's grace unto me and unto those who look unto the words of God. Who is able to produce verses from himself and write them by His leave? All are powerless before it. This is what God, my Lord, hath specially conferred upon me of His grace. Verily, His grace unto me is immense.Praise be unto God in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. And glory be unto God in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: God, verily, loveth order in all things. In all things ye manifest the order of God. Thus, if ye have a ring on your right hand, place one likewise on your left, for this is of God's order whereby ye may be strengthened. And if there be an amulet on your right arm, and none on your left, this is not of God's order. Therefore, order all your affairs according to what ye comprehend from God, and then according to what ye yourselves love. We have not seen a house built with order except that We dwelt therein upon the land of mystery.Say: Order ye your writing in your books in such wise as to attract. And whatsoever your pen writeth at the beginning of your book, write ye similarly at its end, lest your writing vary while ye walk in the justice of God. And preserve ye your books, and write not therein that which God loveth not to behold, while ye fashion therein like unto the Most Glorious Pattern. Thus shall ye preserve it.Say: The criterion of your writing, if ye wish to be just, is that were someone to write a thousand thousand times, not a single letter would vary. Such writing alone is just in the Book of God. Thus shall ye nurture your souls in spirit and fragrance.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest!Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Glory and the Might, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Ruby, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, Thine the Majesty and the Grandeur, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Likeness and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Exaltation, Thine the Greatness \[...\]

Thine is the Grandeur and Independence, and Thine the Majesty and Glory, and Thine the Might and Invincibility, and Thine the Power and Exaltation, and Thine the Joy and Gladness, and Thine the Sovereignty and Authority, and Thine the Kingdom and Dominion, and Thine the Rule and Sway, and Thine whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither companion nor son, nor had Thou any partner in what Thou didst create, nor any helper in what Thou didst fashion. By Thy power Thou didst create all things and ordain them according to Thy decree, and by Thy will Thou didst fashion all things and shape them according to Thy design. O God! Make him whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection to be, of all the writings Thou lovest, the most splendid, the most exalted, the most beautiful, the most noble, the most glorious, the most luminous, the most perfect, the most complete, the most powerful, the most great, the most effectual, the most capable, the swiftest, the most beloved, the most honored, the most sovereign, the most royal, the most elevated, the most sublime, and the most impregnable of all that Thou hast created among the possessors of writing from among Thy servants and the Manifestations from among Thy chosen ones. O my God! Inspire, then, everyone who possesseth a cherished handwriting that none should withhold it lest anyone be veiled from Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest through a writing by which one turneth to Thee in the days of his youth, for that is of Thy grace upon him and upon all Thy creation. For in the ocean of the Bayan is that most exalted Pearl, and Thy purpose in the Bayan is that most resplendent Jewel. All the dwellers of the sea are created, sustained, die and live through it, for this is the Throne of Thy Manifestation and the Seat of Thy Concealment. Through it Thou makest Thyself known to all things. Whoso knoweth Thee through it and turneth to Thee by it, such a one hath truly known Thee. Otherwise he hath squandered his existence and knowledge in Thy path by being veiled from Thy desire and love in the kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. O God! Do Thou educate all who are in the Bayan that they shall not purchase the verses, words, tablets, and writings of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, nor anything that pertaineth to Him, for that is most exalted and impregnable with Thee, as it pertaineth unto Thee. By Thy glory! A single leaf containing His writing and mentioning His good-pleasure toward me is better in my sight than all that is on earth, and were I to possess the former I would give all to obtain the latter. O God! Do Thou teach all who are in the Bayan a way to attract His writing and possess His traces through what they devise in the kingdom by Thy leave, for on the day of His manifestation they know not. Perchance they may be drawn and possess through the means at their disposal, and that in every land there be appointed one who may convey the writings of all Thy creation to whomsoever He willeth, that thereby they might come to possess Thy writing on the Day of Resurrection and behold Thy words at the Hour, should they fall into their hands, that they may read and behold. The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things \[...\]

In the name of God, Most Great, Most Great!All praise be to God Who hath risen in His loftiness above all contingent things, Who hath elevated Himself in His exaltation above all created things, Who hath made Himself unapproachable in His inaccessibility above all existing things, Who hath manifested His power above all atoms, and Who hath asserted His dominion over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Book.He hath made Himself known in every Manifestation from the beginning that hath no beginning, and will make Himself known unto the end that hath no end, through wondrous tokens from His presence and verses from His being, at which all the peoples of the world stand powerless, that all His servants might be assured that this is from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. For the handiwork of God is unlike the handiwork of His creation. He hath chosen an exalted Essence in that Manifestation and bestowed upon Him signs from His presence, any single one of which would render powerless all the peoples of the world. He hath given Him writing of surpassing attraction and beauty from His presence, whereby all sincere servants of God are drawn unto Him. This is of God's grace unto the Point of the Bayan, after He had not shown aforetime unto the Point of the Furqan such transcendent handiwork, that all might know that there is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth by His command. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious.In the name of God, Most Great, Most Great!All praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Great, the Most Great. All glory be from God unto the First Unity and unto him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. I testify that God, glorified be He, hath ever been an unknowable Mystery. No vision can grasp Him, but He graspeth all vision. He is the One, the Most High, the All-Compelling.He hath associated with Himself the writing of the Tree of Truth through the Primal Truth, then through those manifestations of divine authority nearest, and yet nearer. If thou shouldst attain the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted and glorified be His mention, and obtain writing from His presence wherein lieth His good-pleasure with thee - even if thou shouldst traverse from East to West of the earth and offer all that is thereon in His path - this would be better than all thou hast done or shalt do. Indeed, all thy deeds from the beginning of thy life unto its end - nay, from the beginning that hath no beginning until such time as thou remainest alive - are for this purpose. Yet perchance when He Whom God shall make manifest giveth thee writing, thou wilt not love it nor take it. Marvel not at this, for Muhammad aforetime sent writing unto one who read it not, and I am loath to mention after this he who was forbidden in the Bayan. The Point of the Bayan wrote unto one of those who wept night and day for His manifestation, yet when His writing fell into his hands, he neither read it nor took it. Thou shalt be tested on the Day of God's Manifestation, so be mindful lest thou be veiled from God, thy Lord \[...\]

On the Day of God's Manifestation thou shalt indeed be tried. Therefore, be thou mindful of thy duty, lest thou be veiled from God, thy Lord, and from His Book, after having been a seeker thereof throughout thy life. For on the Day of His Manifestation, He Whom God shall make manifest may write unto thee informing thee of the revelation of His own Self, yet thou, failing to comprehend by thine own insight, mayest hearken to the words of the people who are but confused rabble, and pay no heed to the Cause of God. Therefore be thou discerning, sharpen thy vision and purify thy sight, that when His writing reacheth thee, thou mayest accept it and place it upon thine eyes by virtue of its connection to Him, whether it be from Him directly or from another. For this is God's command unto thee, that thou mayest not be among the perishing ones.And it hath four stages. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Golden, the Most Golden. There is no God but He, the Most Golden, the Most Golden. Say: God is more golden than any possessor of goldness. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can withstand the sovereignty of His golden dominion. Verily, He is the Golden, the All-Golden, the Most Golden. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them - say: all are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them - say: all are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sublimity, then the Sovereignty and the Material realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God hath created for you the camel and made it a sign for them that observe. It beareth what ye are unable to bear from land to land. God conveyeth through it whatsoever He willeth. Will ye not then be thankful? God hath created the mules whereon ye ride, that they may bear what ye are unable to bear from land to land. Will ye not then remember the signs of God? Say: God hath created for you the donkeys whereon ye ride, that they may bear what ye are unable to bear from land to land. Say: God hath created for you the swift-footed beasts whereon ye ride, that ye may journey with them from land to land with a speed that ye love. Say: God hath created for you the cattle, the greatest \[...\]

And He made it a sign unto them that behold. It beareth what ye are unable to bear from land to land. God removeth through it whatsoever He willeth. Will ye not then be thankful? God hath created the mules which ye do ride, that they may bear what ye are unable to bear from land to land. Will ye not then be mindful of the signs of God? Say: God hath created for you the donkeys which ye do ride, that they may bear what ye are unable to bear from land to land. Say: God hath created for you the dromedaries which ye do ride, that ye may journey with them from land to land with greater speed than ye desire. Say: God hath created for you the cattle, the greatest and mightiest from which ye derive benefit. Say: God hath created for you the animals of diverse kinds beyond your reckoning. All these are signs from God that ye may attain unto certitude. God is your Lord and the Lord of all things. He createth you and sustaineth you and causeth you to die and giveth you life and preserveth you in your ways from that which ye fear, through His angels of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. Will ye not then be certain of the signs of God? Say: The best that ye ride are your dromedaries, then your mules, then your donkeys. Through God's grace and mercy ye journey from land to land, yet ye ascend not unto God your Lord from your earth. God hath prescribed in the Bayan that ye should all proceed from your dwellings unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, for ye were created to attain unto the presence of your Lord. Will ye not then turn toward God your Lord with guidance and truth? Say: Ye journey from land to land for that which God hath commanded you regarding your livelihood that ye may earn your sustenance. How then do ye veil yourselves from Him Who created you and sustained you and caused you to die and gave you life and commanded you to follow the true religion, this being among the things commanded you? Fear ye God and be ye God-fearing, for ye shall all be tested on the Day of Resurrection. How many servants journey from that land to the slopes of that mountain once every week though they possess not the weight of a silver piece, nay less than that, yet they present not themselves before their Lord Who created them to lay before Him their needs. Thus are ye, O people of the Bayan, being tested. Say: God is in truth independent of all that is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. He desireth naught by this save what shall cause you to be saved. Otherwise We would not wish to permit them to appear before Us - how when they turn away from Us? We desired to teach you your ways and that the weight of your faith equalleth not a silver piece for which ye go forth every week to trade, yet ye go not forth from your dwellings for God your Lord nor do ye earn His good-pleasure, except those who have believed in God their Lord and who place their trust in their Lord. Such as these, in their very dwelling places, have entered into the religion of God and God will guide them and protect them from those who wish them not well. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: All shall be rewarded according to what they have earned. Whoso earneth the weight of a mustard seed of good, God will reward him with a goodly reward.

And He shall verily protect them from such as love them not. He is, assuredly, powerful over all things. Say: All shall be recompensed according to their deeds. Whoso acquireth good to the weight of a mustard seed, God will requite him with a goodly reward, and whoso acquireth less than this, if He wisheth He will forgive him, and if He wisheth He will take vengeance upon him. He is, verily, vigilant over all things. Say: God will assuredly take vengeance throughout all lands upon those who judge by His command while they are veiled from the Command of God. Should they return unto God, their Lord, they return not unto their land, and should they remain veiled, they are veiled upon their own land. Fear ye God, O people of the Bayan, on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for verily ye shall, on the Day of Resurrection, prostrate yourselves before Him in truth. And should ye veil yourselves, veil not those who follow you, lest ye possess their fire after your death while ye know it not. This is of God's bounty unto you, that perchance ye may, on the Day of Resurrection, enter into the religion of God. Say: God will verily preserve those who have believed in God and His signs, and who place their trust in their Lord. No grief shall touch them in the path of God, and they shall remain patient in the good-pleasure of God. They shall have from their Lord that which they remember night and day.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Golden, the Most Golden!Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Glory, Thine the Sovereignty and the earthly realm, Thine the Honor and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Face and the Perfection, Thine the Symbol and the Symbols, Thine the Stations and the Grandeur, Thine the Power and the Action, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Authority and the Justice, Thine the Greatness and the Independence, Thine the Pride and the Splendor, Thine the Might and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Exaltation, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. The sovereignty of Thy Cause hath ever proceeded from Thee, causing Thy loved ones to move from the stations of one command to another, and the King of the glory of Thy power guideth Thy guides from the places of Thy leave to the places of Thy leave. Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Living, the Supreme, the Sovereign, the All-Compelling, the Most Holy. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. They circumambulate Thy House and the stations of the living Furqan by Thy leave, and all proceed by Thy command, yet they proceed not unto the Manifestation of Thy Self. Thou hast ordained in the Furqan commandments wherein is the proceeding of all who follow Thy commandments, yet they remain veiled from Thy countenance. By Thy might and the sovereignty of Thy singleness \[...\]

By Thy grandeur and sovereignty of Thy oneness, if Thou wert to manifest me upon the exalted height of Thy dominion and the loftiness of Thy divinity, I would bar all paths leading unto that place, for it beseemeth not these creatures to attain the presence of Thy Self, to present themselves before Thy Being, to proceed unto Thy Essence, or to appear before Thy Reality. But now Thou seest what Thou seest - the birds of desire seek Thy countenance, and those whom Thou hast not permitted, who behold not Thy proof with Thine eye, do likewise. Glorified art Thou and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been mighty throughout all eternity, and beloved throughout all eternity, past and future, dominant over all things in grandeur and independence, and self-subsisting over all things in might and transcendence.O God! Do Thou cause all who are within the Bayan to be of such character that they would journey from the East of the earth to its West for the sake of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. How much more then should they attain His presence, since Thou didst create them for this purpose and hast ordained no glory for them like unto this, for this is the ultimate means of their attaining unto Thy Revelation, their arrival at the Dayspring of Thy hiddenness, their establishment before Thy grandeur, their seeking refuge before Thy countenance, and their becoming independent through Thy Lordship. By Thy might! Never have I seen among those in Islam a fire like unto their being veiled from Thy proof and their remoteness from Thy presence. Sufficient unto them is this abasement in Thy sight and in their own, after their having known that they treat their Beloved in ways they would not wish for themselves. Glorified and exalted art Thou! We have no glory except through Thee alone, there is no God but Thee, and no abasement except through our being veiled from Thee alone, there is no God but Thee.O God! Do Thou make Thyself known on the Day of Resurrection through Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, and grant us certitude and faith at the moment we hear, lest we be counted among the veiled ones. For Thou art the Best of those who show grace, Thou art the Most Generous of the generous ones, Thou art the Most Bountiful of the bountiful ones, and Thou art the Most Kind of the kind ones.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Precious, the Most PreciousAll praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath ascended in His transcendence above all created things, Who hath become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existent things, Who hath manifested His dominion above all atoms, and Who hath revealed His sovereignty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness, as He Himself doth testify, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Precious. He hath created all things that they might attain the presence of the Manifestation of His Self, appear before the Dayspring of His Mystery, and present themselves at the Source of His bounty in such wise as beseemeth His transcendent exaltation, His sublime inaccessibility, His exalted loftiness, His transcendent transcendence, and the elevation of His grandeur. For were all on earth to exist in their highest possible state, and were the Manifestation of Reality to appear and be seated upon an unadorned surface, it would behoove all that are on earth to prostrate themselves instantly before Him, even as they prostrate themselves before God their Lord - and this would be their glory, did they but know it. For verily they and the prostrations that proceed from them are but creations before that Exalted and Transcendent One, that Inaccessible Being Who dwelleth in the horizon of the Divine Essence.

This then is at the horizon of the Divine Identity and the majesty of the Eternal, and what is beneath it. They believe at the time of His manifestation in His worthiness, so they are proofs and believers in the station of their creation and the sphere of their limitation. Otherwise, exalted be His station at His ascendancy - all who exist surely glorify His remembrance and prostrate before Him due to His lofty glory. And we are all prostrating before Him, and we are all devoted to Him. Through this we shall glory above all the worlds and be exalted above all who exalt themselves.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Golden, the Most Golden. Praise be to God, there is no God but He, the Most Golden, the Most Golden. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembles that First One wherein naught is seen save the First One. And then I bear witness that God hath ordained in going that it should be unto God the best abode and return, and in the path of His leave and His good-pleasure the best glory and retreat. Therefore go thou forth in the path of God, for thy sustenance resteth with God. If thou diest or grievest, then it is incumbent upon God thy Lord to grant thee the reward of both in such wise as will gladden thy heart after thy death or in thy life. But thou must be discerning in thy religion on the Day of the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Perchance thou goest to the Sacred House and to the stations of the Living One even as thou hast witnessed in My Manifestation, yet none of this will profit thee after His Manifestation, for all that is exalted through its relation to Him, and verily He is more exalted and more glorious. Go thou unto Him with all thy being and detach thyself from all else in thy inmost heart and outwardly, for thou wast not created in vain. And before His Manifestation, go thou according to His ordinances as thou willest and when thou willest. Lift not thy feet save with the intention of God thy Lord, and ascend not to a height nor descend to a depth, and climb not to any spot nor enter any house of His love except with God's good-pleasure and His command. Beware, beware lest after the Manifestation of God thou continuest in what was commanded before, for then thou wouldst be more asinine than any ass, since all that is exalted through its relation to Him Whom God shall make manifest. How then canst thou, on the day of His Manifestation, pride thyself on what is honored through its relation to Him, yet fail to take pride in Him Whom God hath made the Manifestation of His Self? Be thou discerning in thy religion with true discernment, for thou art among those who shall be tested. And seek refuge with God thy Lord from whatsoever thou lovest not by believing in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in whosoever calleth thee to Him, even were they but a small child, for this is what shall profit thee and naught else beside it, if thou art among the discerning in thy cause.The First in the First: In the Name of God, the Most Helping, the Most Helping. There is no God but He, the Most Helping, the Most Helping. Say: God is the most helpful above every possessor of help. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His helping power, neither in the heavens nor on the earth nor what is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been a Helper, Helping, and Most Helpful. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down in worship before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them do glorify. Say: All stand obedient before Him. God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Glory and the Grandeur, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Might and the Precious Stone, then the Sovereignty and the human realm. He maketh to live and causeth to die, then causeth to die and maketh to live. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. He is, verily, potent over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and all that lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme Ruler, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God will, verily, aid you in every Dispensation through the Manifestation of His own Self, if ye seek aid from God. Say: Verily, your aid in the Cause of your Lord is manifest, would ye but understand. Say: Your aid lieth in the inspiration of your Lord, would ye but know. Let all examine within themselves how they seek aid from God, their Lord. Yet they comprehend not the workings of God's command, nor do they seek His aid. Say: The aid of God in the day of Muhammad was that which was revealed in the Qur'an. They who embraced Islam were aided thereby. But they who remained bound to their scriptures received naught of their Lord's aid, though they perceive it not. Fear ye God, O people of the Bayan, lest ye be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, whereby the aid of the All-Merciful would be cut off from you while ye know it not. Say: His aid lieth in His words, through which ye are created and sustained, then caused to die and live again and be resurrected. Take ye His aid and preserve it as ye would your own eyes, for through it shall ye live until the Day of Resurrection. Possess nothing except through truth and return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest after Him Whom God shall make manifest all that ye have received from Him Whom God shall make manifest, for this is the greatest command that God hath revealed from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end. We all believe in Him and we all firmly believe in what God shall manifest after what He manifesteth. He is our Beloved in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that lieth between them. We live but for Him and we all bow down before Him. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. All who are in the heavens \[...\]

He is God! There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. All that dwell in the heavens and on earth and all that lie between them glorify Him. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting. All that dwell in the kingdoms of heaven and earth and all that lie between them are submissive unto Him. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign. To receive a single verse from Him is better for you than all that you possess from the Covenant of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for on the Day of Resurrection after the Resurrection, thereby shall you attain salvation. We shall give you the key of knowledge that you may be guided thereby. When the Sun of Truth dawns, He doeth what He willeth by the leave of His Lord. This is what God hath done - will ye not rejoice? And He shall ordain what He pleaseth - this is what God hath ordained - do ye not believe with certitude? Behold your beginning, for it is from a single Temple, then your return shall be likewise, but ye do not understand. Your beginning and your end - God knoweth your secret and your manifest thoughts, and what ye do by night and by day. Say: The Sun of Truth shall arise countless times, for it is the Primal Sun of the Beginning, yet ye believe not in God's Sun. The Primal Sun of the Beginning is the Primal Sun of the Beginning, and it hath no beginning, even as it shall have no end though ye ascend unto infinity. Thus the beginning of you all, O ye Mirrors, is from a single Sun, and your return is unto a single Sun. Through it ye begin from God, your Lord, and unto God, your Lord, through it ye return. Believe in every Manifestation and the first to believe in Him and what He ordaineth, that ye may attain salvation in every Revelation. Say: God's sustenance in that Day is from the Point of the Bayan. Those who have entered therein have indeed attained, but those who have veiled themselves and persisted in their ways have cut themselves off from the sustenance of the All-Merciful, and they know it not, though their souls are certain, yet they remember not. Say: An hour of reflection is better for you than all the acts of worship ye perform throughout your lives, for that hour may deliver you on the Day of Resurrection, while your lifelong worship will profit you not if ye be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest. Take ye the sustenance of the All-Merciful in the Bayan, then live thereby until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then on that Day ye shall offer what ye have received unto God, then take ye the wondrous sustenance of the Beloved in what God revealeth unto you. Say not "How?" for this is the Day of Resurrection wherein ye shall attain salvation. Say: The greatest sustenance is to believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and then in what He uttereth from God - believe ye in this. If ye comprehend this sustenance, ye shall comprehend all sustenance; otherwise, the sustenance of those before you will profit you not, even though ye be God-fearing, just as those who were given the Book before you were God-fearing, and though they derived sustenance from what they possessed, yet God permitted it not, nor have they any life to begin save the Fire, then unto it shall they return. O all things, from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end! Me alone do ye worship, then in the signs of God from your Lord do ye believe with certitude, then through His names do ye turn unto Him, then through what He hath ordained by night \[...\]

And they have no life except what begins from the fire and unto it they shall return. O all things, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, ye worship Me, then ye believe with certitude in the signs of God from your Lord, then ye turn unto Him through His names, then ye act according to what He hath ordained by night and by day. This is what profiteth you in every Revelation; therefore weary not yourselves, for verily the essence of your religion is but one word, would that ye believe in it with certitude. That is but one soul, would that ye be guided by it. That is the first one to believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. That is the first mention of the Will in its manifestation, yet ye believe not in it with certitude. Say: In every Revelation your likeness is as trees that have grown old. Do ye not look upon him who appeared in the Qur'an? A thousand two hundred and seventy-five years have passed over him, and before them the Book of Jesus for five hundred years, then Moses for five hundred years. Reflect a little, if ye be sincere in the religion of God, and bear witness that in every Revelation ye are like plants that spring forth from the earth. Ye should be kind to the companions of Him Whom God shall make manifest according to your capacity, for verily their likeness is as plants that spring forth from the earth - their growth is stronger than your trees. Do ye not reflect upon this and be guided thereby? If ye but knew, ye would cut down your trees and prostrate yourselves before that which springeth forth from the earth until it is raised therefrom. This will save you on the Day of Resurrection and ye shall enter the Paradise of His good-pleasure. But ye and what ye possess will profit you not after the Day of Resurrection. Therefore watch for the Command of God, for verily it is nearer than the twinkling of an eye. When He cometh unto you with the truth, believe in Him. And if ye be engaged in prayer, break it off, for verily ye act for God's sake. And verily what ye hear on the Day of Resurrection, ye shall be called to account for your deeds before Him Whom God shall make manifest. How then can ye be veiled by a single prayer from Him Who created you, sustained you, causeth you to die and giveth you life? If ye speak of your deeds, then verily ye possess nothing. And if ye say "yea," yet if ye perform not every good deed, how then can your prayers or other deeds profit you after the Manifestation of God? Therefore fear God and place your trust in God, your Lord. Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and kingdom! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and power! Glorified be God, the Lord of strength and divinity! Glorified be God, the Lord of force and authority! Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and the human realm! Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and majesty! Glorified be God, the Lord of beauty and countenance! Glorified be God, the Lord of face and perfection! Glorified be God, the Lord of might and action! Glorified be God, the Lord of similitude and example! Glorified be God, the Lord of station and exaltation! Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and inaccessibility! Glorified be God, the Lord of power and elevation! Glorified be God, the Lord of joy and gladness! Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and might! Say: God hath created for you the water of the One, whereby ye comprehend the mystery of the One. That is the name of the One whereby \[...\]

Say: God hath created for you the water of unity whereby ye may perceive the mystery of unity. Through this, the Name of Unity, ye shall know the First Unity. In it is your life, did ye but know, and in it is your tranquility, would ye but witness it. He hath created for you living creatures and ordained their sustenance from His presence in the Book. Will ye not then be certain of what God hath ordained? Say: Verily God shall create you, sustain you, cause you to die, and give you life, and unto Him shall ye return. Say: Verily, I am nearer than all things, both before and after, and all are worshippers of Him, all prostrate themselves before Him, all are devoted to Him, all remember Him, and all are humble before Him. Say: Whatever thing ye desire, recite ye the verses corresponding to the number of that thing as ye attribute to its names. If ye love wealth, then recite ye the verse of wealth. If ye love exaltation, then recite ye the verse of exaltation. If ye love glory, then recite ye the verse of the Most Glorious. Likewise with all that ye love in your religion and your world, your beginning and your end. If ye love knowledge, then recite ye the verse of knowledge. If ye love might, then recite ye the verse of might. But ye recite not because of your negligence. To recite one verse with spirit and fragrance is better for you than to recite a thousand verses without spirit and fragrance. Thus will God annihilate you on the Day of Resurrection through clear verses in all that ye love. Say: Verily, one of these verses is greater than the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, but ye understand not the mystery of what hath been revealed therein, nor do ye witness it. Say: We have made all things in their numbers, then revealed for each one a verse that ye might derive sustenance through the numbers of all things. Say: All derive sustenance from God, and all stand firm through God's command. Say: All these and those are sustained by the verses of thy Lord - these by what was revealed before and those by what was revealed after. All prostrate themselves before God their Lord according to what they have by their Lord's command. But ye witness the beginning of the Command, for none disobeyeth at each Manifestation, and ye shall enter into the novel manifestations of your Lord that ye may be saved in the Resurrections which none can reckon save God. Had He not brought you out of the first innovation, how could ye comprehend the novel Manifestation thereafter? Say: Glorified be God above what ye mention! Thus after the first innovation, He removeth you from the manifestations that were revealed from His presence aforetime and causeth you to enter into the manifestations that are revealed from His presence thereafter. This is from God's grace upon you. O all things! Ye perceive the novel manifestations from Him Whom God shall make manifest, then the thrones of Reality in every manifestation. And it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Shadowing of the Most Shadowing. There is no God but He, the Most Shadowing of the Most Shadowing. Say: God shadoweth above all possessors of shadow. None in the heavens \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Concealing, the Most Concealing! There is no God but He, the Most Concealing, the Most Concealing! Say: God is more concealing than all who conceal. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withstand the sovereignty of His concealment. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been an All-Concealing, All-Sheltering, All-Overshadowing Protector.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command, by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God hath created all things by His command. His is the Creation and the Command, from before and from after. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He is the One Who originateth what He willeth by His command, and unto Him shall all return. This is God, your Lord. His is the Creation and the Command. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation and the Manifest One over His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Observe ye therefore the Day when God shall descend in the shadows of the clouds with the angels round about Him. On that Day shall ye be brought before God your Lord.Say: No vision can grasp God, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the All-Compelling, the Beloved. Say: He hath ever been as He was in every condition, never descending. Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe. Rather, this is a remembrance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye bear true witness. The Day when He shall descend upon you - that is the Day when God shall have descended in the shadows of the clouds, and those round about Him are they who stand firm by God's command. These are they who glorify their Lord with praise by night and by day, and they are prostrate before Him.Say: God hath attributed this to His Own Self, the might of the Manifestation of His Self, that ye may know the true measure of God on the Day of His Manifestation. He is the One Who hath made Himself known to you before the creation of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, yet ye recognize not Him Who created you.

Ye fail to recognize Him Who created you and nourished you and caused you to die and brought you to life, though unto Him shall ye return. O thou who bearest that Name! We have taught thee aforetime that which was revealed in the Book, and verily We have been among those who teach. Write down that which hath been revealed from God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. Verily that Name shall attain unto thee the number of Qaf and Nun from names of mighty exaltation. We have interpreted these on the Day of Resurrection that their thrones might receive from their Lord a goodly and well-pleasing recompense. This is of God's bounty unto those who have believed in God and His signs, and those who place their trust in God their Lord. We commanded thee aforetime only to preserve what was revealed from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Should a single letter escape thee, We shall assuredly call thee to account and question thee and make demands of thee on a mighty and exalted Day. Therefore watch over thyself from that day, for verily We are cognizant of all things. We shall not question thee concerning thy deeds, for verily We are self-sufficient, but We shall question thee concerning that which We revealed unto thee, as this is among God's signs unto Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, that He might look upon them and recite them from His Lord and reward those who believe in them with an exalted recompense. We have commanded those who believe in God and His signs to send thee the equivalent of a gracious Lam. Take thou the Vav for thyself, then present thyself before the mention of thy Lord's name, the Bestower, the Great. Likewise unto the mention of thy Lord's name, the Judge, the Gracious. Likewise unto the mention of thy Lord's name, the Mighty, the Great. Thus when thou attainest unto something mighty and exalted from the Most Glorious Tree, a remembrance from God - verily He is the Most High, the Most Exalted - make no mention of that remembrance, but rather purchase noble gifts and send them to the Most Glorious horizon, a remembrance from thy Lord in the latter and former days. We have commanded the equivalent of Ya for whomsoever hath borne the first letter of Sin. Deliver thou unto her and convey greetings unto her from her Lord, and console her with goodly and mighty solace for what was taken from her. Had We known that she would comprehend the knowledge of her Lord's verses, We would have revealed unto her that which would give comfort to thy heart, and verily We have been mindful. After thou hast acquired the number of this, deliver the like thereof unto that number among those who are known in Islam, that they might remember on the Day of Resurrection and return unto themselves. Then its roots unto that number among those who have believed in God and His signs and were sincere in God's religion. This is Our gift unto the believers - a single letter thereof equals not what is in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. Verily We have been cognizant of the measure of Our verses, and verily none other hath comprehended their might nor can estimate the words of thy Lord, and We have been cognizant of all things. The second in the second: In the name of God, the Most Shadowing, the Most Shadowing! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Unto Thee belongeth sovereignty \[...\]

Thou art One and there is none other beside Thee. Thine is the Kingdom and the Kingdom of Heaven, Thine is the might and the dominion, Thine is the power and the divine realm, Thine is the strength and the chrysolite, Thine is the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine is the glory and the majesty, Thine is the countenance and the beauty, Thine is the face and the perfection, Thine is the exemplar and the examples, Thine is the station and the reverence, Thine is the grandeur and the independence, Thine is the awe and the manifestation, Thine is the glory and the inaccessibility, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Cause and Thy creation. All abide beneath the shadow of Thy Lordship and prostrate themselves before the threshold of Thy oneness.Glorified and exalted art Thou above being described by change or alteration, or being characterized by likeness or transformation. Sanctified are Thy names and exalted are Thy examples. There is nothing like unto Thee. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, self-sustaining, sovereign, supreme, holy, everlasting, enduring. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast ordered the kingdom of Thy Cause and Thy creation through the signs of Thy mighty power and wisdom over all who dwell in the kingdom of Thy heaven and earth through the manifestations of Thy eternal glory.Unto Thee be praise, praise that is exalted, inaccessible, and elevated, which no praise in Thy knowledge can equal, nor can any glorification in Thy Book compare with it - praise that filleth Thy heavens and Thy earth and whatsoever lieth between them of the kingdom of Thy Cause and Thy creation, through the exaltation of Thy Word and the inaccessibility of Thy gift. Praise whereby the shadows of the tree of Thy oneness are made manifest upon all created things, and the splendor of the tree of Thy unity overshadoweth all contingent beings, until there remaineth in Thy knowledge nothing that perceiveth not Thy mercy and dwelleth not beneath the shadow of the sovereignty of Thy loving-kindness.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the Being before all things, the Essence above all things, the Creator of all things, and the Reality after all things. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the Most Overshadowing, the Most Overshadowing. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things, ascended in His elevation above all existing things, become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all beings, prevailed in His dominion over all atoms, and manifested His power over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Overshadowing. He hath chosen an exalted Essence, a glorious Abstraction, a camphor-like Reality, a lofty Simplicity, and an eternal Abstraction, then revealed Himself to it through it \[...\]

Then He manifested unto it through itself, and through itself He withdrew from it, and cast into its essence the likeness of itself. Thus did its signs appear from it, and His heavenly kingdom and earth were filled thereby - that there is no God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God chose for it from the letters of His life-giving nature its first ones, then caused them to enter the sea of endless finality. Thus were His heaven and earth filled - that there is no God but Him, the One, the Fourth Shadow in the Fourth.In the Name of God, the Most Shadowed of the Shadowed. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Shadowed of the Shadowed. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whoever resembles that One wherein naught is seen except the First One.I testify that God, glorified be He, has ever been and will ever be in one and the same state, and that all that has been witnessed in the Book of limited names and conjoined attributes - these are from the qualities of the Sun of Eternity, from the praises of the Primal Point, which God has attributed to Himself for the inaccessibility of His Word and the exaltation of His eternity. I testify that what I have witnessed does not necessitate conjunction - far exalted is God above this, with great exaltation! Rather, that which is attributed to the Tree of Truth, God has attributed \[...\]

Unto His Self, wherein naught is seen save God, exalted be His glory. When thou attainest unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His loftiness, and it is revealed unto thee, then shalt thou witness with thine own eyes that which was revealed in the Book, whether all who dwell on earth bow down before Him on His right and His left, or whether it be revealed unto thee alone. For at the moment of His solitude, all within their stations glorify their Lord with His praise and turn unto their Creator. This is what was formerly revealed concerning the angels who circle round Him. Be thou discerning in thy recognition, preserve thyself and that which God hath revealed unto thee from His Book, await the Command of God and its exaltation, and the Word of God and its invincibility. Verily, we are all supplicants of His grace.And it hath four stations. The first among the first: In the Name of God, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme. There is no God but He, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme. Say: God is supreme above all who are supreme. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withstand the power of the sovereign authority of His supremacy. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been a supreme Builder of supreme degree.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all within the heavens and earth and what lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will verily build for you the edifices of your unity through that which He revealeth unto you through your own selves. Will ye not then be thankful? Say: He hath indeed built your religion for you through numbered words whereby ye profess your faith. Say ye: "Glory be to God," then affirm your certainty in the Dawning-Places of the First. Then "Praise be to God," then affirm your certainty in Him unto Whom the verses have been revealed. Then bear ye witness that there is no God but Him, then affirm your certainty in the Manifestations of Divine Unity with God. Say: All this is life through God's command. Do ye not see? Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God createth you and provideth for you. Will ye not then be thankful unto your Lord? Say: Who hath created the heavens and the earth \[...\]

And between them all, if ye but knew it. They will surely say: "God." Say: How then will ye not believe in Him Who hath sent down the verses? Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Sustainer of all things, and unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: God will cause you to die, then will He bring you back to life, and unto Him shall ye all be raised up. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. And unto God prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Well-Beloved. And unto God prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Who hath created you, and unto Him shall ye return. Say: God createth you by His command. Will ye not then believe in the signs of God? Say: In Whose grasp is the dominion of all things, and unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: God is the Creator of all things, Who determineth the measures of all things by His command, and Who sendeth down from His presence the remembrance of all things in a perspicuous Book. He is the Truth. There is no God but Him, and unto Him shall all be turned about. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. He it is before Whom prostrateth whatsoever He hath created and createth, and we are all prostrate before Him.Say: Exalted be God, the Lord of sovereignty and dominion! Exalted be God, the Possessor of might and grandeur! Exalted be God, the Lord of power and divinity! Exalted be God, the Lord of strength and glory! Exalted be God, the Lord of dominion and earthly power! Exalted be God, the Lord of glory and majesty! Exalted be God, the Lord of beauty and comeliness! Exalted be God, the Lord of the face and perfection! Exalted be God, the Lord of might and action! Exalted be God, the Lord of similitude and example! Exalted be God, the Lord of stations and sublimity! Exalted be God, the Lord of mercy and bounty! Exalted be God, the Lord of authority and justice! Exalted be God, the Lord of grandeur and independence! Exalted be God, the Lord of majesty and splendor! Exalted be God, the Lord of glory and invincibility! Exalted be God, the Lord of power and exaltation! Exalted be God, the Lord of joy and gladness! Exalted be God, the Lord of sovereignty and might! Exalted be God, from before and after, there is no God but Him, the One, the Most High! And exalted is He in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the One, the Most Glorious. He it is in Whose grasp is the dominion of all things, and verily there is no God but Him, the One, the Sovereign. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all be turned about. He it is Who hath originated you by His command, and unto Him shall ye return. Say: Sufficient unto me is God Who hath created me and provided for me and will cause me to die \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Glory be to Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without partner. Thine is the kingdom and the heavenly dominion, Thine the might and the celestial realm, Thine the power and the divine essence, Thine the strength and majesty, Thine the sovereignty and the earthly realm, Thine the glory and grandeur, Thine the countenance and perfection, Thine the visage and beauty, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the stations and sublimity, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the power and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and authority, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation.Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, ever-living, all-sustaining, sovereign, all-pervading, holy, everlasting, dependent on none. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. All are Thy servants and within Thy grasp, that they may worship Thee in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou art the First, and there is naught before Thee, and Thou art the Hidden, and there is naught beyond Thee. Thou hast ever been God from all eternity, and the Beloved from everlasting to everlasting. Thy existence precedes all beginning and Thy permanence outlasts all ending. Thou art the Being before all things, the Creator of all things, the Essence above all things, and the Existant after all things.Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then to die and to live, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath elevated Himself in His loftiness above all created things, Who hath made Himself invincible in His might above all atoms, Who hath manifested His power above all existence, and Who hath revealed His appearance above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation doth testify that there is no God but Him.He hath built the House of the Bayan with pure and pristine gems, with lofty and camphor-like pillars, with ramparts of loving-kindness, with dawning-places of glory, and with rising-points of splendor. It hath shone with the light of glory upon all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He hath made the structure of this wondrous creation and this mighty, impregnable House from the first revelation of the Bayan unto all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thus have all outpourings descended upon those who dwell in the kingdom of earth \[...\]

When all divine aid descends upon those in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, these bounties are borne by the essences of realities, the spirits of the abstract, the souls of the ethereal, the beings of the pure, and the manifestations of the inaccessible. The aid connects to all atoms, and each partakes of the water of life from its Lord according to what befits it from the dawning-places of His generosity and the rising-points of His grace, until houses are built with their doors, and seats are raised with their thrones, and all beings are filled, in their heavens and earth and whatsoever is therein and thereon, with wondrous remembrance of their Creator - for verily there is no God but Him, the One, the Builder.He hath chosen a mighty essence, an exalted purity, a radiant being, a lofty abstraction, and an eternal reality. Then He revealed Himself to it through it and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Thus His signs appeared through it and filled His heaven and earth. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Creator of all things through His sovereignty, the Provider of all things through His majesty, the One Who causes all things to die through His inaccessibility, and Who gives life to all things through His exaltation. He hath no partner in His Essence, no likeness in His attributes, no equal in His deeds, no peer in His names, and none like unto Him in His ways. All are His servants and in His grasp, glorifying Him with praise by night and day, and unto Him are they submissive.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. And verily the Glory from God is upon the First One and upon whosoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that the glory of the House of clay is for the glory of the Divine House, and what thou seest of seventy thousand souls circumambulating that House in each cycle is because it resembleth the House of Reality and is related to God, its Lord, through a commemorative relationship. If the glorification of a house of clay that is attributed to God is such as this, how much more glorious must be the House of Oneness and the raising of those inaccessible edifices!When thou recognizest Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention, and buildest for Him clay - whether it be clay or above clay - and createst thine essence in such wise that thou associatest naught with God, then it behooveth thy heart to be guided by the names of His building and to abide beneath the shade of the names of His uniqueness. Blessed is he who buildeth houses for God! Consider how many mosques have been built wherein the wealth of God hath been spent, for wealth revolveth around itself - if it increaseth not, it decreaseth not. Verily, villages pass from one hand to another. When mosques are built in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest so that creation may draw nigh unto Him, these are houses raised unto God. Otherwise, far be it that such buildings should ascend unto God or find shelter in His shade! Therefore, occupy thyself with building the House of Unity and the seats of detachment, for these are more glorious than those houses in the sight of God, the King, the Exalted, the Glorious.

And the stations of unity are more precious before God, the King, the Most High, the Most Glorious, than those houses. Yet you should not remain veiled from those houses, for the elevation of those stations is not manifest to the people of limitation except through the elevation of those earthly houses. Therefore build them, and if you are able, construct them above the water with red rubies, or else with whatever means are available to you. And there are four levels for it. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Repentant, the Most Repentant. There is no God but He, the Most Repentant, the Most Repentant. Say: God is more repentant than any who turns in repentance. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of the King of repentance. He creates what He wishes by His command. Verily He has ever been the Forgiver, the Acceptor of repentance, the Turner unto men. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and on earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and earth and between them glorify. Say: All are devoted to Him. God bears witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Power, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Force and Authority, then the Rule and the human realm. He gives life and causes death, then causes death and gives life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dies not, and the King Who passes not away, and the Just Who wrongs not, and the Sovereign Who changes not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapes, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates what He wishes by His command. Verily He has power over all things. And blessed is He to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted is He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and what lies between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: If you seek God's forgiveness, He will forgive you, and if you turn unto Him in repentance, that is from God's grace and mercy upon the worlds. Say: Verily all seek forgiveness by night and by day, and we all turn in repentance by night and by day. Say: God has sent down forgiveness in the Book for those who believe in the Bayan. These shall dwell in the paradise of their Lord's pleasure, and these shall rejoice therein. Say: God gives life and causes death, and verily unto Him shall all return. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and verily unto Him shall all be turned. He is the Truth, there is no God but He. He gives life and causes death, and verily unto Him shall all return. That is God, your Lord. His is the Creation and the Command. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. O bearer of that Name! We have given you tablets of mighty and impregnable glory to the number of Qaf and Nun, that you may preserve them as your own eyes, then convey them to those who transcribe the verses of your Lord, that they may preserve them in a mighty and glorious Book. Grieve not over anything in the path of your Lord, for all stand firm by God's command.

The Nun from the Tablets of impregnable glory! Guard them as thine own eyes, then convey them unto him who writeth the verses of thy Lord, that he may preserve them in a Book of transcendent glory. Grieve not in the path of thy Lord over anything, for all stand firm by God's command. Place thy trust in God, the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Journey thou from truth to truth, and record the number of all things, and convey it unto those who think they do good. Draw not nigh unto that which grieveth thee, for verily We are independent of all things. We have commanded the number seven to write such numbers as before, then by God's command to convey that through God's bounty unto them, that they may fill the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them with the remembrance of their Lord, and be among the helpers in the days of God. Say: Draw not nigh unto that which grieveth you, and preserve yourselves through that which ye are able. Witness ye that negation is manifested through what is therein, and ye, through what is within you of affirmation, do affirm. Say: Ponder ye your affairs and be mindful of your ultimate return and abode, then place your trust in God, your Lord. Say: The sun hath risen and noon approacheth while all are sleeping. That is the Day of Resurrection when all shall be brought before God their Lord - some knowing, others knowing not. Remember thou God, thy Lord, by night and by day, and contend not with anyone in all the worlds. Look not upon anyone save as God hath testified concerning him, for this is the certain truth. And if thou art able to be present there, then remember what cometh from God, the Most High, the Most Great. Verily the splendor of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the majesty of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the beauty of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the grandeur of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the light of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the mercy of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the words of God are upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the glory of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the sovereignty of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Verily the dominion of God is upon them who have believed in God and His signs and are assured of meeting their Lord. Recite thou, when thou art devoted in prayer, that which is revealed in that moment from God, that thy heart may be nourished by thy Lord's provision and that thou mayest be among the protected ones. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Verily Thou art the Sovereign of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou givest sovereignty unto whomsoever Thou willest.

Glory be unto Thee! Thou dost grant sovereignty to whomsoever Thou willest and dost withdraw it from whomsoever Thou willest; Thou dost exalt whomsoever Thou willest and abase whomsoever Thou willest; Thou dost render mighty whomsoever Thou willest and dost humble whomsoever Thou willest; Thou dost bestow victory upon whomsoever Thou willest and dost bring low whomsoever Thou willest; Thou dost enrich whomsoever Thou willest and dost make poor whomsoever Thou willest; Thou dost protect whomsoever Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the Kingdom of all created things. Thou createst whatsoever Thou willest by Thy command; verily Thou art powerful over all things.Thou dost cause the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night; Thou dost cause the moon and the stars to rise in the night and the sun to rise in the day; Thou dost hold up the heavens without pillars and dost maintain the air in the atmosphere of the heavens; Thou dost bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living; Thou dost provide sustenance to whomsoever Thou willest beyond what any of the sincere ones can reckon. Yet God hath not permitted anyone in the Book, when reading from the Book of his Lord, save that he should maintain a spirit from His presence and manifest composure. Is this not a bounty from God unto those who have believed in God and His signs, and who are certain of the meeting with their Lord? Therefore guard thyself against those who know not the truth yet count themselves among the righteous. Speak nothing but the truth that hath been revealed in the Book, for this is a path of certain truth. Look upon no one except as they were on the day God created them, that thou mayest be among the mighty in the days of God. Deal kindly with those who have believed in God and His signs, for they are thy brethren in Paradise and are, in the sight of God, among the guided ones.O My God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and Glory, Thine the Sovereignty and the earthly realm, Thine the Grandeur and Majesty, Thine the Beauty and Radiance, Thine the Countenance and Perfection, Thine the Might and Action, Thine the Mercy and Bounty, Thine the Likeness and Examples, Thine the Stations and Sublimity, Thine the Glory and Invincibility, Thine the Power and Transcendence, Thine the Joy and Gladness, Thine the Sovereignty and Authority, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Living, All-Compelling, Sovereign, All-Protecting, Holy, Everlasting, Independent, Transcendent, Invincible, Most High. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou ordained all things, and by Thy will hast Thou given form to all things. Thou hast ever been existent before all things, and the Cause of all things, and the Creator of all things.

Glorified and mighty art Thou! Glorified and majestic art Thou! Glorified and beauteous art Thou! Glorified and great art Thou! Glorified and luminous art Thou! Glorified and merciful art Thou! Glorified and perfect art Thou! Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and mighty art Thou! Glorified and powerful art Thou! Glorified and well-pleased art Thou! Glorified and loving art Thou! Glorified and sovereign art Thou! Glorified and generous art Thou! O Creator of all things and Sustainer after all things!All must worship Thee according to the truth of Thy oneness, and all must glorify Thee according to the truth of Thy singleness, and all must sanctify Thee according to the truth of Thy unity, and all must testify to Thy oneness according to the truth of Thy grandeur, and all must magnify Thee according to the truth of Thine eternity.Is there anything, O my God, between which and Thee there is not Thy forgiveness? Does not everything bear witness unto itself that it must turn in repentance unto Thee? Nay, by Thy might! Verily, I seek Thy forgiveness for all that Thou hast created or wilt create, and I turn in repentance unto Thee for all that Thou hast brought into being or wilt bring into being, being assured that Thou hast ever been the Forgiver of those who dwell in Thy kingdom and the Acceptor of repentance of those who inhabit the dominion of Thy heaven and the earth of Thy will.The existence of creation itself bears witness to what it deserves of forgiveness, and the essence of invention itself indicates what is befitting of the word of repentance. Therefore, glorified and exalted art Thou above how Thou hast named Thyself the All-Forgiving, for which Thou deservest praise such as none hath offered before and none shall offer hereafter. And I thank Thee for having named Thyself the Ever-Relenting with gratitude such as none hath expressed before and none shall express hereafter. For if Thou didst will to exercise Thy dominion and Thy power, who could stand before Thy justice and Thy equity?Glorified and exalted art Thou! Glorified and sanctified art Thou! Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then to die and to live, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the ThirdIn the Name of God, the Ever-Relenting, the Ever-RelentingPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, and manifested His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and established His dominion above all atoms, and demonstrated His triumph above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and revealed His appearance above all that existeth in the kingdoms of beginnings and endings. He beareth witness, and all His creation, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Ever-Relenting. Then He beareth witness, and all His creation, that the One of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath sent down unto Him the Bayan and hath ordained therein the measures of all things with most excellent remembrance and exposition, and hath made it Paradise for those who walk in the chambers of the All-Merciful, and fire for those who follow not what hath been revealed therein with clear proof. And God hath chosen for Him primary beloved names, then caused them to enter the primordial limitless ocean, whereupon the heavens were filled thereby \[...\]

God chose for Himself such primary names as He loved, then cast them into the Primordial Ocean of Infinity, whereupon the heavens and earth and all that lies between them were filled with evidence of His Self, testifying that there is no God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. The Fourth within the Fourth. In the Name of God, the All-Forgiving, the Most Forgiving. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the All-Forgiving, the Most Forgiving. And verily all glory from God be upon the One and upon whosoever resembleth that One wherein naught can be seen save the Primal One. I bear witness that God, glorified be He, hath revealed Himself to all names through them, through a single revelation, even as the sun shineth upon all mirrors through a single effulgence. And verily I am abashed before the attribute of the All-Forgiving and the mark of the Ever-Relenting. For how, O my God, my Lord, my Master, my Ordainer, and my Creator, did God not name Himself by that Name, nor was that attribute revealed in the Book, except as a token of grace from His presence upon His servants, and as a manifestation from the horizon of His glory upon those who dwell in the kingdom of might and power. Verily God loveth not that anyone should seek forgiveness from another, nor that anyone should turn in repentance unto another. Nay, He loveth not that such things should be attributed to the Manifestations of His unity. However, since He beholdeth every possessor of His remembrance and every bearer of His praise, He hath therefore revealed these two Most Great Names for those who love to call upon their Lord at morn and eventide.

And they seek forgiveness from God, their merciful Lord, both at eventide and at dawn. When thou art finished with thy journey, return unto God, thy Lord, but beware, beware of mentioning sorrow, for I have no need of gladness born of grief. And I counsel those who follow Me that they should not approach the fire, for therein are traces thereof. Be preserved through God, your merciful Lord, unless you wish to touch it, in which case pluck it with water lest you witness sorrow, for that is what God has counseled thee and all the believers.There are four stages. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Decisive, the Most Decisive. There is no God but He, the Most Decisive, the Most Decisive. Say: God is Most Decisive above all who are decisive. None can withstand the sovereign power of His decisiveness, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Decisive, the Decider, the Most Decisive.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Praise be to God, Whom all things glorify in the heavens and on earth and what lies between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that declineth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly decree in the Book that those who believe in God and His verses in the Bayan shall enter Paradise, and that those who believe not in God and His verses on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest shall enter the fire. O Temple! Bear thou witness that there is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them can frustrate thy Lord God. He createth what He willeth by His command "Be" and it is.Think not that We are content to cause Our faithful companions to ascend unto Paradise after We had power to assist them. Far exalted is thy Lord God above such a thing, with supreme exaltation. Rather, when We created in the Qur'an, throughout long years of planting We called night and day that We might honor them with what they sought of Our grace. And We witnessed that servants persistently \[...\]

And We bear witness that servants have persisted in this and have been supplicating by night and day. We have favored them and honored them and answered their prayers and admitted them into the Ridvan, and they are now enjoying themselves in the highest Paradise. At the right hand of each one are a thousand youths like hidden pearls, and at the left hand of each one are a thousand houris like hidden crimson rubies. They dwell in mansions of ruby, clothed in silk embroidered with gold. Before them is whatever their souls desire, and God increases His bounty unto them. Verily, there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. They rejoice in those who yearn for their stations, and they say: "What of you and your life? Why do you not ascend unto us? Will you not die in the dust and perish? Why then do you not perform deeds that will cause your works to return unto God, your Lord, and remember you with an exalted remembrance? Verily, He is the Peerless, the Inaccessible, the Most High, the Sublime."And Mahdi recites in the Ridvan these verses, and We are hearing: "Say: O God! Thou art the Support of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Thou givest guidance unto whom Thou willest, and exaltest whom Thou willest, and abaseth whom Thou willest, and aideth whom Thou willest, and forsaketh whom Thou willest, and strengtheneth whom Thou willest, and humbleth whom Thou willest, and impoverisheth whom Thou willest, and enricheth whom Thou willest. In Thy grasp is the dominion of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things."And his brother in Paradise says: "Say: O God! Thou art the Nearness of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Thou givest nearness unto whom Thou willest, and takest away nearness from whom Thou willest, and exaltest whom Thou willest, and abaseth whom Thou willest, and strengtheneth whom Thou willest, and humbleth whom Thou willest, and aideth whom Thou willest, and forsaketh whom Thou willest, and causeth to perish whom Thou willest, and impoverisheth whom Thou willest. In Thy grasp is the dominion of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest."Behold how We created them from two drops of water and returned them to two handfuls of clay. We admitted them into Paradise and made their tongues speak. This is the reward of those who have returned to the Point of the Bayan, and these are they who are alive in the sight of God, they who are detached. Then look at those who have returned to the Tree of Negation - it is itself dead, and likewise those who have returned to it. Thus dost Thou cause to enter the fire whom Thou willest, and verily We are the Bountiful. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! God will not give me through Him everything from a mighty, inaccessible, and exalted youth unless We love that We sacrifice them in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that they may return unto God. Perchance God will cause one among them to speak, else all begin from a drop of water and return to a handful of dust. Therefore be thankful for those whom We have admitted into the Ridvan, and be not of the sorrowful. For We will not answer the prayer of those who call upon Us, and this is of God's bounty which none comprehend save the God-fearing. Consider how many servants in Islam call upon Us by night \[...\]

This is a bounty from God which none but the God-fearing can comprehend. Consider how many servants in Islam invoke Us night and day, and recite the Prayer of the Covenant in the morning, yet We answer not their prayers and seize their souls while they yet yearn. Thus do We exact retribution from the guilty. Say: If ye be truthful in your prayers, this is the gathering-place - how is it that ye enter not the paradise? And if ye be liars in your claims, God hath placed in your hands proof of your falsehood. Otherwise, how could ye remain patient? If ye be truthful, why do ye wander to the right and to the left, and come from here and there? These are the prayers of your bodies, and these the words of your tongues. This testifieth that we are liars, and this testifieth that we are truthful. Otherwise it would not be possible for God, your Lord, to manifest Himself, and what was decreed hath been decreed, while ye remain patient like the dead. Soon shall ye weep and implore until the next Resurrection, but ye shall find no way thereto. Know ye then the value of the days of God, and act with truth and sincerity. Say: O all things! Were ye to know what We know, ye would sob, then swoon, then die and be counted among the dead. And be not veiled from God, your Lord, for even the twinkling of an eye by being veiled from the Manifestation of His Self, while night and day ye prostrate yourselves. And as for the verses that were composed, We have indeed heard them. Say: Glory be to Him above all that hath been created and shall be created. All are His servants, and all within the bounds of existence do speak. Were all on earth to describe Him Whom God shall make manifest to the utmost of their ability, they would not comprehend an atom of His description. How then could they describe Him Who created Him? One letter of what God describeth Himself through the tongue of the Manifestation of His Self is greater than all that any describer could describe. Yet We have decreed that whoso composeth poetry in praise of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and should it reach Him in the time of His manifestation, We shall build for him in Paradise two thousand mansions of crimson ruby. Thus do We reward those who praise the Manifestation of their Lord and are certain of Him. But for him who composeth poetry before His manifestation, no mansion shall be built, for should he attain unto His manifestation, he might not praise Him and might not be numbered among the believers. How many servants praised Me in the years of the Seedling in their books and poems and from their pulpits and seats, yet all were on that day veiled from My Self. How then could their praise benefit them, were they to reflect? Say: Their likeness is as the likeness of those who described Muhammad, the Apostle of God, according to what Jesus had promised them in the Gospel, yet when He came to them, they said in return for their description: "Verily, Thou art not of the truthful ones." Consider - had they not described Him, it would have been better for them than what they said in His presence without right. O all ye poets, fear ye God! O people of the Bayan, all of ye fear God! O ye who mount the pulpits, all of ye fear God! O ye who occupy the seats, all of ye fear God! For ye are all liars except those who compose poetry on the Day of God's manifestation and then recite it truthfully in His presence. Nay, if ye compose verses about what hath been manifested, it shall benefit you in your manifestation.

O all poets, fear ye God! O people of utterance, fear ye God! O people of the pulpits, fear ye God! O people of the seats of authority, fear ye God! For ye are all liars except in what ye recite on the Day of God's Manifestation and then truthfully before His presence. Indeed, if ye compose verses about Him Who hath appeared, it shall benefit you in your own manifestation, but concerning Him Who shall be made manifest it shall not profit you except during His manifestation. And if ye compose poetry about Him Who hath appeared in truth, verily ye are composing it about Him Whom God shall make manifest in truth.Consider those servants who are interpreters - they have interpreted the Qur'an while they have no certitude in Him Who revealed it. How much more so regarding verses that have been sent down from His presence! Such is the extent to which these people act without understanding. And as for what thou hast asked concerning the elixir - We counsel thee and all seekers that if ye desire this, go forth in the path of God that He may grant thee His recompense, for He is the most excellent of rewarders. And if thou desirest to accomplish thy purpose thereby, verily God will fulfill thy purpose and the purpose of all His servants through means He hath created. From there do ye seek, whether thou knowest this or comprehendeth it not - ye shall be created from a drop of water and return to a handful of clay.Yea, We shall give thee the most perfect elixir. This is what shall cause thee to endure among the worlds: When thou recognizest a Manifestation in His Manifestation, refer all thy deeds to Him. For if He mentioneth thee with His good-pleasure, thou shalt be remembered until the Day of Resurrection with glorious and beauteous remembrance. Thou wilt have manifested the fruit of that for which thou wast created and wilt be recorded in God's Book among the righteous.If thou art in the midst of that Manifestation, then establish the Cause of that Manifestation according to thy capacity. But watch over thyself at the time of the subsequent Manifestation, for all shall be tested then if thou art among the discerning ones. Thou mayest desire to establish the former Manifestation while veiling thyself from God thy Lord in the subsequent Manifestation, thinking thyself among those who establish the truth, when in fact by being veiled from the subsequent Manifestation thou art veiled from the former Manifestation, nay, from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end.For all people are tested at the time of the subsequent Manifestation, when the followers of the former Manifestation desire to establish it but thereby exclude themselves. Consider those who accepted Islam - they all desired to establish the religion of Muhammad but were veiled from Muhammad in His subsequent appearance. Otherwise they would never have opposed Him themselves, much less opposed His followers. This pattern exists in all religions - they all desired to establish their religion but were veiled from God's Manifestation, and thus entered into the fire wherein they shall not be helped.O all things! Watch over yourselves at every Manifestation, for ye establish the former Manifestation \[...\]

O all things! Be watchful over yourselves at every Manifestation, for you affirm the first Manifestation while remaining veiled from the latter one. Your affirmation profits you nothing, and it would be better for you had you not affirmed at all. O all things! Fear ye God! This is what We have given thee of an elixir that hath no equal, after thou wast created from nothingness. Remember with the Ancient Remembrance unto the End that hath no end, and be not annihilated in manifestation if thou art among those who sail upon the sea of names. Should God bestow upon thee all the elixirs of the heavens and earth, they would not suffice thee, they would not suffice thee apart from that Elixir, for after that thou shalt surely die and be not remembered among the worlds. This is what We have bestowed upon thee of the elixir of existence as a bounty from Our presence, for verily We are the Bountiful. And if thou desirest the elixir of earthly dwellers, take the flux, then work it for forty days with the refined solution, then complete it with acid, then place it in a china cup, then cook it on a low flame for three days, then remove it and say "This is from the creation of God, the Subtle, the Most Subtle, the Kind," for this will manifest from it what the solar ones manifest, not what the lunar ones produce. But seek God's help in this, for if thou shouldst possess this, thy body would be blinded and thou wouldst perish, yet thy heart would not live by what We have taught thee. Verily We are knowing of all things, and We are bountiful unto all.The Third and Twentieth Chapter of the Vahid, containing four stations:The First in the First:In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted. Say: God is more exalted than any possessor of exaltation. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His exalted sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Exalted, the All-Exalting, the Most Exalted. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all things in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Realm of Yakut, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

Blessed is He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. And blessed is He to Whom belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God, verily, provideth sustenance unto all things as He willeth through His command. No God is there but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God, verily, causeth to develop whatsoever He createth in the wombs as He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: God, verily, createth man from subtle clay, then maketh him a drop of water, then causeth him to grow until He maketh him a being possessed of all-encompassing knowledge. Then doth He cause him to develop until He bringeth him to that which was ordained for him in the Book. Then doth He take him and cause him to return to a handful of clay, and causeth him to enter Paradise if he be of them that are assured of God and His signs, or beneath Paradise if he be of them that are veiled in the days of his Lord. Say: God hath perfected His proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them through that which He hath sent down from His presence. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Most Holy. Say: God hath ever been All-Knowing, All-Powerful, All-Wise, and God will ever continue to be as He hath been. His knowledge hath encompassed all things, and He hath created from a beginning that hath no beginning whatsoever He hath created, and will create unto an end that hath no end whatsoever He createth through His command. He hath ever been powerful over all things. He hath sent forth His Messengers from His presence in numbers beyond the reckoning of any who would reckon, and hath sent down Books from His presence in measure beyond the comprehension of any who would comprehend. What thou hast written hath been set before God, and We are all aware of it. What thou hast mentioned concerning how people have differed regarding the appearance of their Lord - some believing, some disbelieving, and some remaining silent - say: There is no God but God in both cases. The believers abide beneath the shadow of affirmation. These are the companions of Paradise, these are they who are mentioned in the presence of God. And others are gathered beneath the shadow of negation, and what they have earned shall profit them not, and they shall die and then enter the fire. And as for those who acknowledge but remain silent, they shall be gathered beneath the shadow of affirmation. God hath placed no station between negation and affirmation wherein ye may pause. The hesitant ones are standing behind the veils of negation. But should they desire to make manifest their belief, if they do so they will be counted among the rightly guided in the sight of God. When the truth becomes manifest to them, if they acknowledge it, these are they who are established in affirmation. And if they become veiled, they have veiled themselves from the truth after having recognized it, and these are they whom nothing of their deeds shall profit, and He shall seize them in their lifetime by their own hands, then after their death for having become veiled. Verily He is mighty, the Lord of retribution. And in every Manifestation the proofs of affirmation endure while the proofs of negation perish.

Those who deny are transient, and both (types) are the community of the Messenger, even as you witness today concerning the People of the Furqan. And what Muhammad spoke before, "My community shall not unite upon error," referred only to those who affirm, otherwise you witness the error of those who deny. How many servants do not acknowledge the true Imams while all are under the shadow of Islam and are believers in what was revealed in the Furqan. But in that Dispensation when you say "We are believers in what God has revealed in the Bayan," this suffices until you become among its witnesses. When you enter through the gate of faith, these are they who stand upon the stations that God has ordained for them. Some journey upon the sea of Names where they know naught but God and His names, and they are assured through the remembrance of the All-Merciful. And some journey upon the sea of the First Creation, saying that what God has created in every Manifestation of His Self is like the sun - though it rises countless times it is one sun, and though it sets countless times it is one sun. We were outwardly believers in them, and what appeared through them was naught but the Cause of God, and all stand by the command of God. And they cite what was revealed in the traditions from the Imams of the Faith: "Whosoever wishes to gaze upon the Primal Point, upon Muhammad the Messenger of God, let him gaze upon the promised Qa'im." And at the time of His manifestation He did not say "Whosoever desires the Primal Point, let him look upon this one," rather He said "Look upon Me and through Me to Muhammad the Messenger of God, if you be of those who know." And thus did Muhammad the Messenger of God speak regarding the mention of the Prophets, that they were Him in the Furqan, if you be of those who know. And before the Primal Point was like the Primal Point - creation has no beginning and no end with God, all journey from infinity to infinity. And some have descended from that horizon - these are they who are given no portion of the knowledge of the Book and do not understand. We need not mention them and their words, for all were created by God's command through the Manifestation of His Self, and all stand by God's command from Him. I have only mentioned those who believed in God and His verses. And what the speakers say - "Ask your Lord about what you were certain of in your religion in the Furqan before, if you were among those who had insight" - did you see Muhammad the Messenger of God or witness any sign except the Furqan as God's proof to the worlds? If you were not certain that all are powerless before it, how did you enter the religion of Islam and become among those who know its laws? And if you say "We heard other verses in which we were certain," this is not a proof for you with God, and if it were a proof for you it would not be a proof for one who wishes to enter your religion, for if he sees no proof other than that proof from God to the worlds, then there is no way for you except \[...\]

And if it be a proof unto thee, it would not serve as a proof unto those who desire to enter thy Faith, for if they behold no other evidence save that proof from God unto all the worlds, thou hast no recourse but to acknowledge that the Quran itself is God's all-sufficient proof unto all the worlds. For His proof was not complete for those who entered Islam in those days, and had God's proof not been perfected and completed for them in their acceptance thereof. This is among the misconceptions of those who, aforetime, were sightless in their Faith. And he who truly sees in his Faith hath no recourse, upon hearing a verse, but to believe in it and to proclaim: "Verily, I am the first of them that believe." For God hath revealed in the Quran that none but God can reveal verses, and ye have witnessed this truth throughout twelve hundred and seventy years. If ye be believers in God's Word, after having heard and seen, how can ye show patience? And should ye say that nothing can render God powerless to reveal another verse, and that ye are assured of this, thy Lord God declareth: "Yea, We have power over all things as We will, yet We send not the Messengers, nor do We grant them verses save as We please, not as ye desire." Read ye the Quran and witness how God rejected those who demanded other verses from Muhammad, and how He established the truth through what He revealed as a verse and reminder from Him unto all the worlds. Think not that these verses were not greater than the verses of the Prophets, for God taught you this aforetime in the Quran, that ye might be among those who are endued with insight in your Faith. Were the verses of the Quran not the greatest proof, how could they abrogate the verses of the former Prophets and what God had granted them of signs, such as the rod of Moses, of which ye know? Reflect but a little on your former Faith, that ye may be enabled to traverse the Bridge on the Day of Resurrection. And if all on earth should believe in God, it would add nothing to God's dominion, for God is independent of all things. Therefore believe in God and then in the Messengers through what God granteth them, not through what ye desire. For if God were to reveal according to your desires, none would remain on earth who had veiled himself from his Lord's Cause. Ponder upon all the previous Dispensations and draw your lessons therefrom. According to your words, the Quran is Muhammad's greatest proof from God, wherein ye all believe and are assured. Yet what God revealed unto Muhammad over twenty-three years, He is able, when He willeth, to reveal in two days and nights. How can ye comprehend this and be patient? Verily, all who speak concerning thy Lord's verses speak without truth, even as the desert Arabs spoke of the verses of the Quran, saying: "These are but tales of the ancients."

Verily the speakers say concerning the verses of thy Lord - all of them speaking without truth - even as the Arabs said concerning the verses of the Qur'an: "These are but tales of the ancients." God exposed their falsehood and the futility of their souls, and established the truth, as ye now perceive. Verily those who believed not in Muhammad were all seized and entered the fire, and God exalted the religion of Islam as ye now witness. Say to those who declare "We shall surely bear witness without our principles concerning the verses": From whence do ye comprehend your principles? After the appearance of Muhammad was proven by such evidence, do ye still seek proofs? And when God sent down such verses unto Muhammad, what had ye to say concerning them? What difference is there between then and now, if ye would but reflect? God hath revealed these verses from a soul untutored as ye are untutored, that ye might understand and perceive. Do they imagine this is a matter wherein they can exercise control? If ye were able, why throughout one thousand two hundred and seventy years did ye not produce a single verse from the beginning of that Cause until now, save the objection that ye possessed not those verses of God whereon ye might reflect? Should all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them gather together to produce the like of such verses, they would be powerless and incapable, even were We to raise them above the earth. This is the impotence of all created things, and this is the power of God, as ye shall come to know. Say: O God! Thou art the Knower of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou bestowest knowledge upon whom Thou willest, exaltest whom Thou willest, raisest up whom Thou willest, abasest whom Thou willest, strengthenest whom Thou willest, forsakest whom Thou willest, enrichest whom Thou willest, and impoverishest whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the dominion of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, by what means Thou willest, for what purpose Thou willest. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Present these verses to all who are on earth, that they might produce the like thereof. And if thou art not among those who are certain, and if they all prove impotent, then believe thou in God Who created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die and brought thee to life, and desired to guide thee in the Bayan through His grace - verily He is the most excellent of those who show favor. Think not this is but a verse, for verily it is life itself. Look to the Knower of the Bayan - for were all on earth to gather together to alter His knowledge concerning His religion, they would be unable. This is the impotence of all before the creative verses, even as they are powerless before the recorded verses. And likewise shalt thou witness all the letters of the Bayan, for verily they are all life itself, and all are powerless before them. Yea, and I have desired that thou mightest gain insight into thy religion - this is what God loveth for thee and for all mankind. If thou gainest not insight, enter not into the Cause, for God loveth not to witness that in any of the believers.

Verily, I have wished that thou shouldst gain insight into thy religion. This is what God loveth for thee and for all the worlds. If thou gainest not insight, enter not into the Cause, for God loveth not to witness this in any of the believers. Rather thou shouldst seek proof through that whereby God, thy Lord, proved aforetime in the Furqan, for this is a straight path. Observe in the Furqan how God proved naught except through verses that rendered you powerless before them. Even as God provided proof, so must ye provide proof. And verily what God hath revealed of the signs of the Prophets or other than this, ye are not charged therewith. And if thou wishest, all this shall be made clear. Look upon all the peoples upon the earth and inquire: Had those who were given the Torah from Jesus found what they found from Moses, how would they have persevered in their religion? And likewise before Moses, and likewise after Jesus. In every Revelation ye take as proof that which God revealeth from His presence and maketh as His testimony. And as for what thou hast mentioned concerning the station of the Point of the Bayan, We have mentioned to thee two mighty stations: The first, in the inmost of the inmost, wherein naught can be seen save all are rememberers unto Him; and in a station of the outmost of the outmost, that is the first that was created by God's command "Be! and it is." And the likeness thereof is as the likeness of the sun from the first that hath no first unto the last that hath no last - it hath ever been but one sun. Say: All are created by God's Will. In that station Muhammad is I, and I am He Whom God shall make manifest, and He Whom God shall make manifest is He Whom God shall make manifest thereafter. Ye shall not be veiled from the Thrones that He manifesteth from their exalted seats. For in Noah and Abraham, then Moses and Jesus, then Muhammad, there was naught but one Manifestation from God, the Lord of the worlds. And beyond these two stations are countless manifestations of that Tree which ye behold in the Bayan. He calleth from God that there is no God but I - this is the highest of stations in the Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And He calleth in another station that verily I am an atom, less than an atom - this is the lowest of stations in the Book. Say: Both are from one single Point, and between them are degrees beyond counting. In the religion of God ye shall not differ, and ye shall look upon each degree within its bounds, that ye may comprehend all things and behold all with the eye of oneness, that ye may not differ. And as for what thou hast sent regarding the tablet of letters, We were indeed watching. The matter was not difficult for him who penned it, rather he desired to separate the first line with other lines, since what is derived from the first line is what was inscribed in the first line. Those who look therein and work within a protective circle need not separate the first line, and when they write what they desire, they extract the answer from the very question without omitting a single letter.

And when they write what they desire, they extract the answer from the very question without omitting or adding a single letter, and they are grateful for what has been given to them. However, what was written did not encompass the knowledge of that circle, and what was extracted was only that of which we were certain, though not by itself, and We were indeed knowledgeable of it. Then bear witness that the paths of the science of numerology are countless, each following their own method of writing and extracting, but not all have been given perfect knowledge of the letters, else they would never err. But God bestows His grace upon whomsoever He willeth; verily He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Like what was given to Muhammad when he decreed years before and extracted what you now hear, thus pure knowledge corresponds to the reality of the matter as you observe in his words. These are his words from which you seek information, giving life to your Lord in both worlds, giving life to those who come after the deviators. And if 'ha' is added to it, know that I have not concealed the essence of the secret, so multiply the very essence by its own number, for this is the name of the Axis of the Worlds. Take the essence before closing after joining, and include it among those who are included. Verily God loves that in every Manifestation there should appear guides to the science of letters that prove the Manifestation of God in the subsequent Manifestation. This is what returns to God of their knowledge and deeds, and God will guide thereby whom He willeth; verily He is the Most Guiding of guides. We have detailed mention of this in that Tablet before, so seek information from there if thou desirest to be among the knowing ones. But make not this the proof of truth, for this exists with others as you witness, and how many servants walk in falsehood though they have been given something of that knowledge, or of alchemy, or of other sciences that you find wondrous or amazing. Yet they believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest in the next Resurrection through these matters, rather they are certain only of what God reveals from His presence. And it has four ranks, the first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Possessing, the Most Possessing. There is no God but He, the Most Possessing, the Most Possessing. Say: God is more possessing than any possessor. None in the heavens or the earth or what lies between them can withhold himself from the Sovereign King of His possessions. He creates what He willeth by His command; verily He was ever the All-Possessing, the Most Possessing, the All-Encompassing. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrating unto Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifies that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the \[...\]

And to Him belong the sapphire, and then sovereignty and the realm of earthly dominion. He causeth to live and to die, then causeth to die and to live, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and a King Whose dominion passeth not away, and a Justice that declineth not, and a Sovereign Whose rule changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God will encompass all things as He pleaseth through what He pleaseth. He hath ever been All-Knowing, the Most Subtle. And since that night was like unto the first year, the witnesses of God were sorely tried. Therefore, remind them on that night of what We have aforetime mentioned unto them, for verily We have been ever mindful, that ye may be reminded through your remembrance, and that in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye may profit by your remembrance. Otherwise, how many servants have remembered aforetime the witnesses of God in their religion, yet their remembrance profited them not in the subsequent Revelation, and they persisted in their remembrance after their resurrection had come to pass, and they are until this moment persisting in their remembrance. Therefore fear ye God, for that remembrance will profit you not except ye understand it. Rise ye up on such a night as that, amidst their afflictions, with contentment and tranquility in your hearts, your spirits, your souls and your bodies, if ye be of them that are tranquil. Verily I am God, the Most Evident, the Most Evident. Recite ye that mighty verse according to the number of the name of the Most Evident therein. Then observe your own souls that ye place them not in negation after ye have been reared in affirmation. Verily I am God, there is no God but I. From a beginning that hath no beginning all the most beautiful names have belonged to Me, and I am the Knower of all things. And verily I am God, there is no God, no God but I. Unto Me shall belong all the most sublime examples unto an end that hath no end, and verily We have power over them. And I shall verily bestow upon them from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end as a grace from Our presence, for verily We have ever been the Bestower of grace. And I shall assuredly curse from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end those who grieve the witnesses of Him Whom God shall make manifest and believe not in Him. The first is the good-pleasure of God, if ye desire to know, and the last is the fire from which ye are warned to beware. Therefore observe your own souls that ye grieve not any one of the witnesses of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then grieve not any one who believeth not in Him, for this is the whole of your religion whereby ye shall be saved on the Day of Resurrection. And though ye should ascend in piety unto a horizon above which there is no horizon, it will profit you not on the Day of Resurrection, but if ye grieve no one, perchance ye will grieve none of the witnesses of God.

But if ye grieve not at another, perchance ye shall not grieve for any of God's servants, and thereby shall ye profit not in your religion, if ye but little perceive. And whosoever desireth to transgress the bounds of your religion, restrain him, O people of the Bayan, all of you together, with kindness and compassion, or else with justice and modesty, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye shall not be afflicted. Verily, those who were given the Furqan, who slew the Imams of Guidance in their days, grieve not until that Resurrection. And likewise, in every Revelation, it endeth that the servants of God who transgress the bounds of God in their words and deeds. Therefore when ye are in the Day of God's Manifestation, be not afflicted. Consider how many were created under the Furqan whom God had forbidden to slay a soul save for a soul, yet all of them acted thus. Or they prevented those who desired to transgress the bounds of their religion and restrained them by their might, so they departed not from their religion and disobeyed not their Lord. And ye shall not grieve until the next Resurrection in the Bayan. Therefore watch, O people of the Bayan, lest any among you transgress the bounds set by God, and if ye witness it, restrain him with modesty and propriety, for God, your Lord, loveth not any conduct unbecoming to the living for anyone in all the worlds. And if ye prevent him not, that transgression will spread through another decree until ye are unable to protect yourselves on the Day of Resurrection, and ye shall enter the abode and receive no help. And ye shall witness transgression, whether complete or partial, and with all your strength and power prevent it and protect, lest anything return on the Day of Resurrection to Him Whom God shall make manifest or to any of His servants, that ye may thereby be saved. But be patient in your Cause, for ye shall not judge the subsequent Manifestation by the presence of the former Manifestation, for ye shall be tested at the time of the subsequent Manifestation. Perchance ye shall hear or witness servants who have been created in the subsequent Manifestation, and ye prevent them by the bounds of your religion, thinking ye are supporting your religion, while ye depart from your religion and perceive it not. We have decreed this for you only that no grief may reach these souls, not that ye should prevent them in the subsequent Manifestation by what We have commanded you in that Manifestation. For if ye command their prevention and restraint, ye shall depart from your religion and shall never be helped. For this is among the bounds of your religion, not at the time of the subsequent Manifestation. Therefore ponder, then ponder, then ponder, then be patient, then be patient, then be patient.Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I have been from a beginning that hath no beginning, even as there is no perfection to My perfection. Verily I am God, there is no God but Me. I shall continue unto an end that hath no end, even as there is no perfection to My perfection. \[...\]

Then meditate ye, then meditate ye, then be ye patient, then be ye patient, then be ye patient. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Perfect in My completion. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Perfect in My completion. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Complete in My completeness. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Complete in My completeness. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Great in My greatness. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Great in My greatness. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Trustworthy in My trust. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Trustworthy in My trust. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Commanding in My command. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Commanding in My command. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been the Life-Giver in My life-giving. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain the Life-Giver in My life-giving. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Self-Subsisting in My self-subsistence. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Self-Subsisting in My self-subsistence. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been the Judge in My judgment. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain the Judge in My judgment. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Generous in My generosity. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Bountiful in My bounty. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Bountiful in My bounty. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. From the beginning that hath no beginning, I have been Great in My greatness. Verily I am God! There is no God but Me. Unto the end that hath no end, I shall ever remain Great in My greatness.The Twenty-Fifth Gate: Concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Spreader." It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Spreading, the Most Spreading. There is no God but He, the Most Spreading, the Most Spreading. Say: God spreadeth above all who spread. None in the heavens can resist the sovereignty of His spreading \[...\]

In His Name is four stations, the first of which begins: In the Name of God, the Most Outspread of the Outspread! There is no God but Him, the Most Outspread of the Outspread! Say: God spreads above all who spread. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can withstand the power of His sovereign spreading. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath been the Spreader, the Outspreader, the All-Spreading.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, unto Whom offer praise all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: We have spread out the earth whereon ye dwell, and likewise the realms of your hearts, your spirits, your souls and your bodies whereon ye rise to heights. And likewise have We spread out the realms of your detachment, your uniqueness, your unity and your sanctification - all from Us, and verily We are cognizant of all things.And when that Day cometh, those who ascend unto God from the realm of your sanctification shall ascend, and that is the very shadow under which ye seek shelter. I have blessed them to the number of those who have borne witness to them. Verily We were the best of those who bless, according to the number set by the All-Merciful in the Book for those who are beloved. We have blessed them and We were the best of those who bless, according to the number of times ye have called upon Us. We have answered you, and verily We were powerful over all things.Thus shall Our believing servants enter Paradise. Do ye not see how man desireth that animals be slaughtered so that wolves may eat them, that they may enter the highest chambers which God hath ordained as a bounty above all animals? We have permitted you to eat thereof, that ye may be thankful. God hath created Manifestations in the Divine Realm who yearn to ascend unto God their Lord, that they may enter the chambers of the throne of manifestation wherein they abide in the eternal life of God. These are the guides of God in the kingdom of creation and the names of God in the realm of command. Therefore make yourselves like unto them if ye desire to dwell in Paradise.

By the Names of God in the dominion of His Command, make ye yourselves like unto them, if ye desire to dwell in Paradise and if ye be traversing the ocean of names. On that day ye shall say, "There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting," according to the number of the name of the All-Merciful, for thereby shall ye attain unto all good. And if ye traverse the ocean of creation, say: "O God! Bless the guides to the throne of Thy manifestation in the Bayan, and take vengeance upon those who have veiled themselves from the guides to the manifestation of Thy Self, through Thy might and power. Verily, Thou art the best of the powerful." But all this must be with spirit, tranquility, contentment and love. To recite once in this manner is better than to multiply recitations.With spiritual exaltation and contentment shall ye recite. Behold how We have created servants from attracted drops of water, then returned them to a handful of noble clay, and cast their remembrance among them, and admitted them into the gardens of names, whereto all turn. How many invincible sovereigns have We created from the beginning that hath no beginning! How many mighty ministers have We created from the beginning that hath no beginning! How many exalted trustees have We created from the beginning that hath no beginning! How many manifest commanders have We created from the beginning that hath no beginning! How many ruling judges have We created from the beginning that hath no beginning in the chain of affirmation and negation! Then We seized them, admitting these into a sublime and holy paradise, and those into utter and remote annihilation. Thus shall We continue to create unto the end that hath no end. We are above all the victorious ones, We are above all the manifest ones, We are above all the powerful ones, We are above all the triumphant ones, We are above all the ruling ones, and We are cognizant of all things.But glory belongeth to those who began from clay and returned to clay, and between these two states of clay attained the good-pleasure of God from the Manifestation of His Self. They shall endure through the endurance of God throughout the eternity of eternities. If in your lives ye witness no sorrow, ye shall die; and if ye witness every sorrow, ye shall die. But what profiteth you is to perform deeds that return unto God, your Lord. None of your deeds return unto God save what returneth to the Manifestation of your Lord. This is what profiteth you. Reflect a little upon your beginning and your end, then understand. Ye cannot take anything out of the kingdom. Ye begin from a drop of water and return to a handful of clay. Ye possess not your lives. Then the earth ye cultivate remaineth for those who are living, and if they be guides to the Cause, they have no decline and they shall endure through the endurance of God. They multiply upon the earth and reproduce, but God shall surely raise up one who will chastise them \[...\]

But God will surely raise up those who will punish them and annihilate them from the face of the earth, until the day cometh when there shall not remain anyone upon the earth who doth not worship God, his Lord, openly among those who are manifest, inasmuch as they follow not the Manifestation of His Self openly among the believers.

Whosoever desires to protect his child, let him write these verses upon an ornate tablet and place it with the one he wishes to protect. For as long as he lives, he shall be protected by the angels of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, as all bear witness before God, the Powerful, the Glorious. Moreover, when ye become aware of conception, these verses shall not depart from the bearer until she delivers her burden. Then they shall not be separated from the child until God brings him to the fullness of his years. Thus shall ye be exalted. And if ye inscribe and place the first verse in gold, this is better for you than that which ye seek to protect. This befits none save him who is a king upon earth. God hath permitted this to all His creation as a bounty from His presence, that ye may witness the generosity of God from His presence in the highest apex as in the lowest depth, and that ye may comprehend the grace of God in the Most Exalted as in the most lowly.Verily, what thou hast penned unto God, thy Lord, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, hath been presented before God, thy Lord, and We were aware of it. And what thou hast written, that Thou art the One, the Single, the Unique, the Exalted, the Independent, and what thou hast mentioned of the innumerable Most Beautiful Names - yea, We were manifest in the thrones of Our names through these names, yet in the station of the Essence, We were sanctified above all names. All turn to Us through Our names, and We were remembered through all Our names, yet in the exaltation of the Essence and the transcendence of attributes, We were above all that. We have made known to the creation of the Gardens of the Bayan a name from Our names, that they might, through all names, sanctify God, their Lord.

O people! Know that We have created lofty gardens of utterance through One of Our Names, that ye may sanctify the Lord your God in all His Names. And these are the mirrors of the Name of Unity. We have made known the number and form of all things that they may testify that there is none other God but Us, the One, the Single. How can these mirrors sanctify their Revealer when they stand in the station of Names within the Name of Unity? After this same manner ye know the degrees of your own essences in the loftiness of your names. And the fruit of all that We have called Ourself by all Names is that ye may not, in the Day of Our Manifestation, be veiled from your Revealer by your own selves. When ye behold yourselves as the manifestation of glory, let not your glory veil you from the glory of your Revealer, and see within yourselves naught save the glory of God. And should ye possess any perfection, let it not veil you from the perfection of the Point of the Bayan, nay \[...\]

Ye behold in your own selves no perfection save the perfection of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. And likewise from the loftiest name of sovereignty to the lowliest name of growth, and all the degrees between them which no reckoner can reckon. And verily what ye possess is like unto the sun reflected in mirrors of names and attributes, and what He Whom God shall make manifest possesseth is like unto the sun that hath graciously accepted the shadows of your stations - how then do ye not show acceptance? And how can ye comprehend that which describeth the Essence in terms of the One? And likewise whatsoever is described by all names is the very Essence, if ye speak in terms of the names of the Essence. But verily We have created all names as mirrors in the kingdom that ye might turn unto Us. Therefore speak ye when ye lie down and when ye rise up: "We believe in God, the One, the Single, the Alone, the Self-Subsisting, beside Whom there is no God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting," that on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye may not be veiled from Him Who appeareth in those mirrors of names.And verily what thou hast mentioned, We were well aware of it. And what thou hast mentioned concerning God's command that all should ask of Him whatsoever they desire, even to the salt they desire - yea, God hath permitted this, but ye know the stations of servitude. That sovereignty belongeth unto God, and all things within their bounds ye witness within their bounds. And what thou hast mentioned that God is the All-Bountiful, the Most Bountiful, the Bounteous - it behooveth not that the servant should ask of Him a thing insignificant. Yea, by the glory of Our Being, the All-Bountiful, the Glorious, it behooveth not that thou shouldst ask of God save all things, if thou be of them that are convinced.How hast thou limited thyself to the number of the letter Nun? Thou hast indeed considered the means of the kingdom, for then wouldst thou be of the praised ones. But thou seest that sovereignty belongeth unto God, and all declare that unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and they speak truly. They assign all that unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they entrust unto its Owner that which He hath created in His dominion, that all may be enriched by His bounty. Verily He is the All-Encompassing, the Subtle. But thou seest in that Day the veils of creation, and We were established upon it.God will soon enrich thee through the means He hath created in the kingdom from His presence. Verily He is the All-Sufficient, the Self-Sufficient. Therefore recite thou the verse of power by night and by day according to the number of thy Lord's name, the Powerful, the Powerful. And likewise in all that thou desirest, recite thou its verse, for We have sent down in the Book a bounty from Our presence for all the worlds.Say: O God! Thou art the Power of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Thou givest power unto whom Thou willest and withdrawest power from whom Thou willest. Thou exaltest whom Thou willest and abaseth whom Thou willest. Thou strengthenest whom Thou willest and humblest whom Thou willest. Thou aidest whom Thou willest and forsakest whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the dominion of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, by what Thou willest, for what Thou willest. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Powerful, the Powerful.

And Thou wilt forsake whomsoever Thou willest - in Thy grasp is the kingdom of all created things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, through what Thou willest, for what Thou willest. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Strong, the Almighty. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! If thou continuest thus and receivest from all who are on earth, none shall oppose thee since all mirrors imagine that within them is the sun, but the sun is in thy mirror while they wander in their delusions. But those in the Bayan walk in the mountains of certitude. And verily We have remembered what thou hast mentioned about thy mother and thy family and thy descendants. O God! Send down upon them all, both men and women, that which will please them, and cause them to enter, after their lives are complete, into the Paradise of Thy good-pleasure, for Thou art the best of those who show grace. All are equal before Thee, and in every verse from Thee they call upon Thee night and day, and verily Thou art the best of hearers. O God! Grant relief to all Thy male and female servants who believe, for Thou art the best of those who grant relief.And it hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Sheltering, the Most Sheltering. There is no God but He, the Most Sheltering, the Most Sheltering. Say: God is more sheltering than any possessor of shelter. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His shelter's sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the All-Sheltering, the Shelter-Giving, the Most Sheltering.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All bow down before Him in prostration. Praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God createth all things by His command "Be" and it is. Do ye not see how God hath created shadows by the sun? They prostrate themselves before God their Lord on the right and on the left. And if God willed He would withhold them. Verily He hath power over all things. Say: The likeness of all things is as a shadow before His primal Will. Do ye not see? Say: Light hath no existence before the sun riseth. Even so, ye existed not before God made manifest the Sun of Truth in your religion. Therefore ponder from the beginning that hath no beginning, how many creatures God hath created who are powerless over \[...\]

O ye shadows! Before the rising of the sun ye exist not; likewise, before God manifests the Sun of Truth in your religion, ye exist not. Consider how, from the Beginning that hath no beginning, God hath created His creation: how they were powerless to accomplish any matter save through the Messengers whom God raised up. Then, by His command, did they act, and He revealed unto them the Books, through their own tongues, and manifested therein His power, that ye might believe and be assured.Consider the creation of the Furqan (Qur'an): how many men and women were created therein from the first day God sent Muhammad until now, all acting by God's command through Muhammad. All are like shadows before the sun, if ye would but see. When God desired to make Himself known, He manifested the Sun of Truth in the Bayan, whereupon ye came into being in another creation.O all things! Were ye not like shadows before God caused it to rise, ye would not exist. Be ye assured, then be doubly assured, that ye were created as shadows after the rising of the sun. In like manner shall ye understand this on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Ye are all but reflections and shadows, save Him; through Him do ye exist. Thus doth He show you the creation of your essences, your realities, your selves, and your beings at the creation of the Primal Remembrance, that ye might remember.After ye became shadows before the Sun of Truth, consider how ye conduct yourselves. Reflect upon those who followed Muhammad before, then Ali thereafter. The creation of shadows and reflections ye should thus reckon and follow, that on the other Resurrection ye may not conduct yourselves toward Him Whom God shall make manifest - the Sun of your existence - in any way unworthy of the Sun. Ye are all but reflections and shadows, would ye but know and see.Such is the cause of your creation as God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, willeth. As ye are illumined by the light of the sun, so are ye guided by the guides of the Point of the Bayan. Know ye the station of God's guides in every Dispensation, for their likeness is as rays proceeding from the sun, and by them are ye all guided.Reflect upon those who have earned in the Bayan what they have earned: those who thereafter enter the Bayan are guided by their guidance, but those who enter not as they entered the Bayan - these shall enter the fire. Thus should ye understand the cause of your existence, for verily in the creation of your light and your fire are ye created by them. If ye believe, ye shall enter God's religion through their guidance; but if ye are veiled from God's Manifestation by what they entered into God's religion, God shall create fire within your souls, and ye shall be created in negation through them.Observe ye the numbers of the name of the All-Merciful in the Book, then seek ye knowledge about the rays of the sun - how ye are illumined thereby yet veiled therefrom. Were ye not rays of the Sun of Truth, ye would not be attracted by its rising, and this ye know \[...\]

And ye understand each one from a land that mayhap some know not, neither can they deduce. Yet your essences are as rays that never separate from the Sun of Revelation. They who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest through their innate nature - these are they who shall attain. Reflect ye then upon the mirrors of their bodies, wherein ye have traversed what those before you traversed not, though ye were all created through them, whether ye believe in their guidance or deny what ye love not thereof, and what God hath revealed unto them from His presence ye comprehend not and follow not. All begin from a drop of water and return to a handful of clay, whether they be the monarch of the earth or the lowliest of creation. Yet that wherein ye take pride hath not created Paradise after your death, and ye seek refuge in God lest ye enter the Fire if ye would but see. Do ye not observe that when the guides of God ascended in the path of God, they entered Paradise, and God revealed verses through their tongues while they rejoiced therein? Thus doth God cause those who believe to enter Paradise, if ye would but slightly perceive. And how those who were veiled from God their Lord have entered the Fire, and they are tormented therein - they die not and are afflicted until God willeth. Verily Paradise is created and the Fire is created in the Book of God, if ye would observe in every Revelation the negation and affirmation. If ye ascend in the path of God, then ye enter the Fire, just as these are the light of God and ye pride yourselves in them before God your Lord. Likewise these are the darkness of darkness - God hath not created guides like unto them, as they traverse the ultimate extinction in His path. It behooveth that the mirrors of their bodies be encased in vessels of gold whereon are inscribed the verses of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, then adorned within with crystal mirrors, not of glass, as a glory from God for them and you, when ye pride yourselves in this. Yet they rejoice in that they enter Paradise, and they regard not nor turn to such conditions. This is what these deserve in the Book, and We have not witnessed anyone manifest from God what they deserve, while they all worship Us night and day. O all things! In all conditions God's good-pleasure in a thing is that which, in every Revelation, ye should love what God loveth, not what was ordained in past Manifestations while ye discern through your own selves. At the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, God's good-pleasure is that in which ye believe and are certain, not that wherein ye follow all the limits of the Bayan. How many followed what God had revealed in the Gospel at the appearance of Muhammad, yet it profited them not a whit. Had they followed at Muhammad's appearance that which pleased Him, how God's good-pleasure would have profited them each day in something, even as ye say that God is each day in a wondrous task.

And had they followed, at the time of Muhammad's appearance, that which would please Him, how would God's good-pleasure have benefited them each day according to what ye say, that God is, each day, engaged in a fresh purpose! Similarly, at the time of the Revelation of the Point of the Qur'an, how many souls acted within the bounds set by the Point of the Qur'an, yet it profited them not, for they veiled themselves from the Point of the Bayan. Yet they act without discernment, for all that was revealed in the Qur'an was for His good-pleasure - and can God's good-pleasure be manifested through aught but the good-pleasure of His Manifestation? Thus doth everything return to the good-pleasure of the Point of the Bayan, if ye be endowed with insight in the Qur'an.Reflect upon the people of Islam: had Muhammad not been pleased with something therein, whether command or prohibition, how would ye then bear witness? Thus have all proceeded from a single Soul, would that ye would ponder but a little. God hath not ordained the religion of the Bayan except that ye should, on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, call upon Him through these same paths. Otherwise, should ye become veiled, your paths in the Bayan would profit you not, would that ye would but see.Muhammad ordained aforetime in Islam that ye should say "There is no god but God" at the beginning of your religion, that perchance on the Day of the Point of the Bayan's appearance ye would not enter into negation and would follow the path of divine names. Yet ye understood naught of that word, and it profited them not though they accepted it for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, comprehending nothing. If this be so regarding the first principle of your religion, how then do ye perceive its final aspects?He commanded you to pray that ye might understand. Verily, what ye recite in prayer, ye recite before God, and ye should realize that He Who commanded you thus would love that what ye were commanded should return unto Him. Yet ye spoke not the words He commanded, though ye pray night and day. Ye are as dead ones who have understood nothing of the religion of Islam, nor think ye that ye shall understand hereafter.Look ye in the Qur'an at the numbered verses: We have sent down the paths of your branches, yet ye have made your entire religion into matters of derivative laws which ye observe in the books of your divines. We sent down in the Qur'an that whereby ye might be saved on the Day of Resurrection, yet ye veiled yourselves from all that and held fast to verses We revealed concerning matters of your religion, and ye strove thereby and counted yourselves among the God-fearing. If ye thus reckon yourselves, We indeed doubt concerning you, and We shall surely show you through negation on the horizon of certitude that ye have not understood a single letter of the Qur'an, else ye would have been guided by Him Who revealed it. Ye are but dead ones, beginning from clay and unto clay returning.The whole religion of the Bayan is that ye might recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His appearance, and then recognize your Creator through His manifestation in the Bayan. Otherwise, your deeds by night and day profit you not, though every community acteth according to its own path by night \[...\]

Every people follows its own path, working day and night. How is it that ye judge them not according to the truth? Nay, if ye were to trace all the paths of the Bayan back to the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest and the exaltation of His Word, then would ye comprehend somewhat of what God hath revealed in the Bayan. Otherwise, ye do what profiteth you not, even as the peoples before you have done. Make all your religion none other than God on the day of His manifestation, that ye call upon none beside Him as having any right. And whosoever wisheth to call upon another besides Him, banish him, lest ye be veiled from your religion by your own sanctifications. For all these things were originated for naught but to establish that Word, did ye but perceive it. We have sent forth the Messengers, revealed the Books, ordained the paths, and distinguished between the people, and We are cognizant of all things. Sell not thy religion for all that is on earth, if ye be truly religious. Look ye upon the glory of your religion, then judge thereby. Were He to appear before Muhammad, the Apostle of God, how would ye deal with God's command from His Apostle to annihilate Him? This is the glory of your religion - how is it ye know not? Consider: the sovereignty of all on earth would not suffice in place of these two words: "This is the glory of God and the glory of His Apostle." Yet perchance ye remain veiled by minor details from the bounds of your religion. Fear ye God and be ye God-fearing. For the religion of God hath ever been, in the sight of those created and yet to be created, more glorious than all else, and all glory is derived therefrom. Look ye upon the speech of the peoples, for the most glorious among them are those who attribute themselves to a religion and act according to its bounds. Look ye upon the kings of the nations - their glory lies in saying "I am the king of that religion," and thereby do they glory and rule as they rule. God hath ever loved the glory of His religion and those who follow His religion. How is it ye love not what God loveth? Say: All glory belongeth unto God, then unto the Point of the Bayan, then unto those who believe in it with certitude. Ye glory in comprehending some of the verses of God and thereby ye judge, yet how is it that on that Day, when He Who revealeth those verses can reveal four thousand verses in a day and night if He so wisheth, ye neither glory in Him nor take pride? And if your former glory in Islam were examined in light of the mystery of the Cause, were ye to consider it - Say: All peoples glory in their religion, could ye but see. Nay, from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end, all glory in one Sun and take pride therein. Know ye then the value of the days of God and what ye are able to accomplish - to exalt the Word of God and to aid the Cause of God. For one verse from the verses of God is more glorious than all that is in the heavens and the earth and what is between them, did ye but know. We have indeed acquainted you thereby with one word from it, which all on earth could not equal nor suffice in place of. Know ye then the verses of God according to your capacity to know.

Know ye, through the signs of God, to the extent of your capacity to know. And be not of those who comprehend naught when deducing from God's signs, for verily their proofs are flimsier than a spider's web, though they draw inferences from God's signs aforetime and perceive it not. Say: O people of the Furqan! How do ye in this day deduce proofs concerning your religion? Is it through what ye possess of the Furqan? Then bring forth another proof if ye be among those who deduce through aught else in your religion. When they are all struck dumb and possess no proof save that, and are unable to abandon their religion, think not that this proof can be equaled by any other proof, for by it were established the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and ye were aforetime indebted to it in the Furqan. This is the proof whereby the word "There is no God but God" hath been made manifest unto all worlds. This is the proof whereby the word "Muhammad is the Messenger of God" hath been established unto all worlds. This is the proof whereby was created the authority of those who were witnesses after Muhammad, the Messenger of God, if ye would but ponder a little. This is the proof whereby were created the primary mystical gates through your Qa'im aforetime, if ye would but reflect a little. This is the proof whereby were created your religious obligations and traditions through your Messenger and your Imams, if ye would but observe a little. Say: O ye who in this day regard yourselves as witnesses from the Imams of the Faith, if ye be truthful in your claim! That proof attaineth three degrees, if ye be endowed with insight. When ye deduce from the words of the Imams of the Faith - who were created solely through the word of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and whose prophethood was established only through the signs of God - how is it that ye are veiled from this proof in this day, and deduce from what was revealed in the three veils? None knoweth the interpretation of God's signs save His God-fearing servants, and verily God's signs are greater in their significance than what ye comprehend of their meaning. Just as ye say regarding the Furqan that none knoweth its interpretation save God and those firm in knowledge, and ye interpret through the Imams of Guidance that which God hath made mighty in station, such that ye yourselves are unable to comprehend its meaning - how then do ye grieve for it and judge without right? I have shown patience from the time God first manifested me until now only to establish the station of that creation and to show them that they were not truthful aforetime. And what proof could be greater than this, that they should prophesy concerning one through whom God hath created all things and through whom all are created, in such a position while all act according to their own desires night and day, and they suppose they are doing good? God shall assuredly make manifest His Cause and show unto each one His power until they see with their own eyes and wish there were a way between them and the Manifestation of their Lord whereby their faith might be accepted.

O people of Islam! After one thousand two hundred and seventy years have passed, when one of our followers, whose name is mentioned by our name in your religion and within the bounds of your faith, pronounces judgment concerning your departure from your religion - because you follow conjecture rather than truth while supposing you do well - if this be your station before one of our followers, how must it be before Us or before God, your Lord and our Lord? Have mercy, therefore, upon your own selves and upon others. After God has manifested the sweet water of life like unto an ocean, you, in your intense thirst, perish not through your own ordinances, though perchance you die striving. Consider, then, the origin of your practice of individual judgment, for it stems from the words of the Leaders of Religion. And verily, the authority of those who are witnesses from God was not established save through the word of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, if you would but reflect. God advanced no argument in the Qur'an for the manifestation of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, except through clear signs - how then do you veil yourselves from them? Think not that We are impoverished through you - glorified and exalted be He above what you imagine! Rather, We are independent of all things. But since God created you in Our love, We desired to save you from the fire, yet you \[...\]

Have mercy upon yourselves! How many nations there are upon the earth, all of whom worship other than God while believing they worship God, their Lord! Therefore be ye certain, then fear God.There are four degrees. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure. There is no God but He, the Most Pure, the Most Pure. Say: God is the Most Pure, above every possessor of purity. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His purifying sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Pure, the Purifier, the Purified.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are submissive unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God is the Creator of all things by His command, and unto Him shall all return. He hath created all things from two Trees, beneath whose shade all seek shelter. The first is the Tree of Affirmation - all abide eternally in its shade in the Paradise of God's good-pleasure. The other is the Tree of Negation - those who seek its shade are in the Fire and shall not be helped.Verily the first principle of religion is what ye proclaim: "There is no God but God," and then whatsoever God ordaineth in every Dispensation whereby that Word is established, if ye be of them who know. Ponder then upon the creation of these two Trees, and rely upon God, your Lord, the All-Merciful.Both Trees worship God as their Lord and are among those who prostrate themselves before Him. The Affirmative ones worship God as He desireth of them and prostrate themselves before Him. The Negative ones worship God according to what He ordained aforetime, yet they worship according to their own desires.Consider how at the appearance of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, those who believed in Him and were sincere - these were they who were created beneath the shade of the Tree of Affirmation and who rejoice in the paradise of God's eternity. And those who were veiled were created in Negation, though they were believers in their religion according to what God had revealed unto Jesus, son of Mary.

Verily those who are veiled have been created in negation, though they believed and were assured in their religion in what God had revealed unto Jesus, the son of Mary. And verily the distinction between them is that the former were believers at first and deemed themselves to be the doers of good, while the latter are believers and are assured in the subsequent Manifestation, disavowing the former and being certain that they are not the doers of good. Reflect ye from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, for all are treading upon these two paths. And verily God is their Creator, their Sustainer, their Quickener, and their Life-giver. This ye witness in the good-pleasure of God. This is the pleasure of the Throne of God's Revelation in every Dispensation, whereby after your death ye shall dwell in the pavilions of Paradise. And the other ye witness in the fire. This is contrary to the pleasure of the Throne of God's Revelation in every Dispensation, wherein ye seek refuge in God from him who believeth not in God. Therefore consider ye the creation of fire and light, then ponder. We have known all things through Our own Self, that there is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. Those who have known God and have acknowledged the proofs of their Lord - these are they who have been created in light, these are the companions of Paradise, these are they who have attained. And those who are veiled from the signs of their Lord and persisted in what they believed before - their deeds shall profit them nothing, nor shall they derive any benefit therefrom. These are they who in the Book of God shall perish. They begin from clay and unto clay shall they return. And God shall cause them after their death to enter into their fire, from which they seek to be preserved. Say: Fear ye God, O all things, then be God-fearing, for ye were not created to begin from clay and return unto clay. Rather were ye created to attain between them the good-pleasure of Him Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die and gave you life, and verily the conditions of your lives are ordained for you, and your religion shall not profit you before God your Lord, if ye but knew. Those who abide beneath the shadow of affirmation - these are they who worship their Lord and these are they who shall inherit the earth. And those who take shelter beneath the shadow of negation - these are they who worship other than God that which profiteth them not, and if they derive benefit in your life in what God hath ordained for them, after their death they shall find no justice in the Book of God if they could but see. Therefore seek ye independence through God, then become exalted in the religion of God. Say: Those who follow other than God - these are they who at every Revelation believe not in the Manifestation, nor do ye follow them. Reflect ye on those who were given the Psalms, for they suppose in their religion until now that they worship God, yet We invalidated them through the Revelation of Moses and testified against them that they were not believers. Then those who were given the Torah worshipped God their Lord until God manifested Jesus from His presence, whereupon they were tested. Those who believed in Him - these are they who worshipped God in their religion \[...\]

And He testified against them that they were not believers. Then those who were given the Torah worshipped God their Lord until God manifested Jesus from His presence, whereupon they were tested. Those who believed in Him were they who had truly worshipped God in their religion, and they were the God-fearing. And those who did not worship God in their religion remained patient until that time. Then those who were given the Gospel worshipped God in their religion until God manifested Muhammad, the Messenger of God, whereupon they were put to the test. Those who believed in Him were they who had truly worshipped God according to the Gospel - these were the triumphant ones. And those who remained veiled entered into the fire and they continue to wait. And after the passing of thousands of years from the manifestation of Muhammad, God made manifest the Point of the Bayan, whereupon those who were given the Furqan (Quran) were tested. Those who believed in Him were they who truly worshipped God their Lord in Islam. And those who remained veiled were like those who came before them, unless God should will to guide them and cause them to enter into the true religion. Verily He hath power over all things. And likewise those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest shall be tested by Him Who shall be made manifest after Him Whom God shall make manifest. You yourselves shall witness this pattern unto the end that hath no end, and shall observe it from the beginning that hath no beginning until this time. Say: The example of the Manifestation of God is as the sun - though it should rise countless times as reckoned by those who count, it is but one sun, and though it should set countless times as reckoned by those who count, it is but one sun, if ye would observe with truth the primal Sun from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end. In all Manifestations ye are guided by the throne of God's Revelation, then are ye saved. Say: Ye must aid yourselves through aiding the Cause of God if ye be His worshippers. Otherwise ye shall surely die and enter the fire, and ye shall not be helped. Say: The proof of God, at the time of its revelation, hath been perfected for all who are in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye would but reflect a little. Say: By that which ye formerly used as proof in Islam, We in the Bayan do take as proof. If anyone from among those who were given the Gospel desired to enter into your religion, would ye adduce any proof other than the Furqan? And besides this ye say naught. None who desired to enter would be convinced thereby, nor would he witness any proof from God in Islam other than that, if ye would adduce proof in truth. If they say the proof of God through verses was not perfected for us in the Bayan, then how do ye adduce that same proof for those who desire to enter your religion? When ye have not seen Muhammad, the Messenger of God, nor witnessed in your lifetime any proof save that, how are ye believers and assured thereby? And that proof of God would not be perfected for you thereafter, as those who had not previously entered Islam would enter therein.

Verily, God's proof against you is not completed by that proof, inasmuch as those who had not previously entered Islam will enter it. God will not punish them after their death, and they shall be questioned concerning them. Reflect a little upon the proof of your religion against others before, that perchance ye may thereby draw evidence against your own selves and save yourselves on the Day of Resurrection. Say: For those who were given the Books aforetime, God's proof was completed and perfected through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and from them naught but the path of God will be accepted in the Bayan, did ye but know. And every Manifestation that appeareth argueth against those who accepted God's previous Manifestation, not against those who lived before that Manifestation, would ye but reflect. These are the verses of God for those who desire to be guided. Say: O God! Thou art the Knower of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou givest knowledge to whom Thou willest and takest it from whom Thou willest. Thou exaltest whom Thou willest and abaseth whom Thou willest. Thou forgivest whom Thou willest and humblest whom Thou willest. Thou aidest whom Thou willest and forsakest whom Thou willest. Thou enrichest whom Thou willest and impoverishest whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, by what Thou willest, for what Thou willest. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Look thou upon the numbers of Thy name, then the name of Him Who is Inaccessible, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily We have mentioned in the Book that We were watching. Praise be to God Who hath guided thee through His command from His presence. This is God's grace upon thee and upon all believers. Make thyself one of the witnesses of the Bayan, for this is God's glory in the Book and for all the worlds. Look not upon those who are veiled in the Book except as those who were veiled before you among the divines of every religion, who observe the limits of their religion while remaining veiled from God's path. And verily thou hast asked about him whose name equalleth the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, concerning the mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Is there any god besides God who manifests anything? All stand by God's command from His presence. Were the creation of that Manifestation not complete, God would not have caused the Sun of Truth to appear. All that appeareth in every Manifestation from the mirrors of Names - all draw proof from God their Lord, even as the mirrors have been exalted and have spoken forth from God, the Protector, the Most High. Aid thou God through him who desireth to aid God's religion, for this is glory for all the worlds. God desireth to help you and show you His power. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Powerful, the Mighty. Let not him who hath no certitude in Him tell tales, for there reacheth not unto God that which He loveth not for him nor for any of the believers. Guard thyself and all God's believing servants, meet with the mirrors, and mention from thy Lord what We have mentioned, and comfort all believing servants. Work not any deed that would cause sedition \[...\]

O believers, hold fast to all the friends of God and perform no deed that would cause dissension, for you cannot protect yourselves from it. Put your trust in God, and then through God shall you be enabled. Guard ye the Mirrors of God, lest they be touched by the sorrow of those who know not the Cause of God, until God rendereth you victorious thereby. Verily, He is the Best of Helpers. Say: O God! Thou art the Helper of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou bestowest victory upon whomsoever Thou willest, and withdrawest it from whomsoever Thou pleasest. Thou exaltest whom Thou willest and abasest whom Thou willest. Thou strengthenest whom Thou willest and humblest whom Thou willest. Thou aidest whom Thou willest and forsakest whom Thou willest. Thou enrichest whom Thou willest and impoverishest whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the dominion of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, through what Thou willest, for what Thou willest. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Train ye your souls, and then your friends, in the days of God, even as these mirrors reflect and through your innate nature speak forth the revelations of God. Say: Put your trust in God, then in the days when ye cannot endure, God will surely grant victory to those who have believed in God and His signs through their own hands.

Say: those who have veiled themselves from the manifestation of their Lord shall be forsaken by their own hands, for God hath power over all things. Say: O my God! Thou art the King of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou givest sovereignty to whom Thou willest and withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou willest. Thou exaltest whom Thou willest and abaseth whom Thou willest. Thou strengthenest whom Thou willest and humblest whom Thou willest. Thou aidest whom Thou willest and forsakest whom Thou willest. Thou enrichest whom Thou willest and impoverisheth whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest, how Thou willest, by what means Thou willest, for what purpose Thou willest. Verily Thou hast power over whatsoever Thou willest.Therefore strengthen Thou the hearts of them that have believed in God and His signs, and deliver them from the winds of their weakness, and gladden them with the good-pleasure of God in their lives and His good-pleasure after their death. And warn them against that which displeaseth God in their lives and against the fire after their death, that they may take heed and reflect, and arise to help themselves and then manifest the religion of God.Say: Be ye not as the dead after God hath made you alive, while ye prostrate yourselves night and day. Rather perform ye such deeds as shall profit you with your Lord, and obey God in that which your Lord loveth. For all peoples obey according to their desires, yet that which they have earned profiteth them not with their Lord, neither that which they do earn. This is the help of God set forth in the Book; therefore help ye through it, for verily ye shall be helped through God.He is the One Whom no vision can comprehend, yet He comprehendeth all vision, and He is the One, the All-Subtle. He is the One from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and He is the One, the All-Knowing. And He is the One Whom nothing can frustrate, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them, and He is the One, the All-Powerful.Therefore watch ye the condition of those that are there, that no grief may reach them, and thou wert among those who were sent down. For God hath servants who remember Him in the fire, and who, in the light, prostrate themselves before their Lord. Through them doth God help those who have believed in God and His signs, when they appear in the pure light, and they cannot enter the fire, nor can they help. And God hath angels whom He hath created with inner beings of light, and hath placed upon their outer forms the effects of fire, and they worship their Lord night and day. And those who enter into the fire to help, to deliver them by virtue of their hearts which were created from light - these are they who seek naught but God, and they take no one as their prey besides Him, and in the fire they show no patience except to help those who are accounted weak in the earth. These are they to whom God shall give their best reward, and after their death they shall enter Paradise. This is in the days when the light was veiled from the worlds, but when the light appeareth, they abide beneath the shadow of God. Through them are ye helped, and through them are ye preserved. They manifest the fire \[...\]

And through them ye shall be preserved. They manifest the fire while in the light they remain concealed, and they manifest the light when God maketh them manifest, and they seek naught but God in their own selves. These are they who, from God, are honored in the pavilions of Paradise. And it hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. There is none other God but He, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. Say: God is more perfect than any possessor of perfection. None can withstand the sovereignty of His perfection's dominion, whether in the heavens or in the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been perfect, perfecting, perfectible. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God testifieth that there is none other God but He. His is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and the sovereignty, then the dominion and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or in the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: God perfecteth His handiwork by His command, and verily He is, unto that, powerful and mighty. Say: Among the perfections of the handiwork of the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, is the establishment of the Cause of His Revelation in every Revelation through the Manifestation of His Self. When thou hast perfected this, then all are perfected through it. And unto God belong all first things, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and verily He is, unto that, powerful and mighty. And unto God belong all last things, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and verily He is, unto that, powerful and mighty. And unto God belong all that was, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and verily He is, unto that, powerful and mighty. And unto God belong all that shall be, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end, and verily He is, unto that, powerful and mighty. Say: We have indeed perfected Our handiwork in the creation of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, then in all things - will ye not behold? We have perfected Our handiwork in all things through that which We have deposited therein as a sign from Our presence that there is none other God but I, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.

Between them all! Do ye not see how We have perfected Our handiwork in all things by that which We have deposited therein as a sign from Us that there is no God but I, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting? God shall assuredly seize those who veil themselves from the Manifestation of His Self in His Revelation, for He is, in truth, mighty and powerful to do this. And God shall surely aid those who believe in Him in every Revelation and who acknowledge the Manifestation of His Self, for He is, in truth, mighty and powerful to do this. Say: Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command "Be," and it is? Is there any god with God who creates aught? Say: Glorified and exalted is He above what they associate! Those who join partners with God shall face a fire more intense than their association, both in the sight of God and in the sight of them who are endued with knowledge, and that which they are promised after their death for what they have earned in their lives - yet their lives would be greater were they but to perceive it. Do ye not see how We have caused Our God-fearing servants to enter Paradise by virtue of their having recognized Our Self and Our good-pleasure? These are they who, in their lives, delight in Our good-pleasure, and after their death shall inherit Paradise, wherein they shall abide forever. Do ye not see how We have caused to enter into the fire those who recognize not the Manifestation of Our Self in every Revelation and who are not assured of Our signs? Thus have We chastised them in their lives, and after their death they shall enter therein, and none shall help them. O all things! We are in truth independent of creating all things. Rather, We created you that We might show you Our independence from you and Our power over you, that ye might thereby perceive, insofar as lies within your capacity, that which is from God. If ye believe in God, then shall ye be delivered from your unbelief, and if ye aid God, then shall ye deliver your own selves - for how can one who is other than Him manifest Him, and how can he who is powerless aid Him who hath not aided Him? Will ye then die in the days of God? Ye begin from a drop of water, then live but a little while, nor do ye aid yourselves by performing deeds that would exalt the mention of your names in the Book of God, though by this ye might attain to your portion of existence. Otherwise ye shall surely die. How many creatures have died before you - doth there remain any trace of them? Ye are like unto them, if ye would but remember. And how many creatures die leaving no trace, as ye know and are assured in your knowledge, though ye see it not. Yea, your mention shall endure in the days of God when it is remembered, and thereby shall the mention of your own selves endure. O all nothingness! Do ye not desire to be remembered through the mention of the Ancient of Days? Then bestir yourselves in the days of your Lord and aid yourselves, that perchance ye may be mentioned in truth in the Book of God. Is there any god with God who originates aught? Say: Glory be to God above what they mention! Is there any god with God who creates aught? Say: Glory be to God above what they mention! Is there any god with God who brings about aught? Say: Glory be to God above what they utter! Is there any god with God who generates aught? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! Is there any god with God who begins aught? Say: Glory be to Him above what they attribute!

And you shall assist your own selves, so that you may be of them who are mentioned in the Book of God in truth. Is there any god besides God who originates anything? Say: Glory be to God above what they mention! Is there any god besides God who brings anything into being? Say: Glory be to God above what they mention! Is there any god besides God who creates anything? Say: Glory be to God above what they utter! Is there any god besides God who fashions anything? Say: Glory be to God above what they describe! Is there any god besides God who initiates anything? Say: Glory be above what they attribute! There is no god but God; all are His worshippers. There is no god but God; all are prostrate before Him. There is no god but God; all are devoted to Him. There is no god but God; all bow down before Him. There is no god but God; all are submissive to Him. There is no god but God; all are humble before Him. He is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. Say: All that you desire that a sign should be manifested unto you from God - do you ask this from other than God? Say: All that you wish that a sign should be manifested unto you from God - from Him Whom God shall make manifest - do you seek this from other than Him Whom God shall make manifest? God is dominant over His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. God is manifest above His servants, and He is the All-Manifesting, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. God is the Provider of all things, and verily there is no god but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. God causes all things to die, and verily there is no god but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Resurrector of all things, there is no god but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. There is nothing except through God and nothing except for God; all prostrate before God their Lord, and all stand firm through God their Lord. So whatever works you produce with your hands are from God's creation, therefore perfect in them your own craftsmanship, for this is from the creation of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Let not what God creates through your hands of your crafts be wasted, except that you demonstrate in it the perfection of workmanship, whether in a great collective work or in a small individual task. For how can one who perfects his craft be certain of the perfection of God's handiwork in himself? O people of crafts, all of you together must be God-fearing, that you may thereby be educated. O peoples of the earth, all crafts are countless things by which you all take delight and give thanks.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most PerfectGlorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no god but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm, then the Glory and the Majesty, then the Countenance and the Perfection, then the Likeness and the Similitudes, then the Stations and the Grandeur, then the Greatness and the Independence, then the Pride and the Revelation, then the Glory \[...\]

All glory and grandeur, then might and exaltation, then power and ascendancy, then joy and gladness, then sovereignty and dominion, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. O my God! Thy handiwork hath ever been perfect, complete, refined and masterful, and will forever continue to be refined, masterful, perfect and complete. Thou didst create the heavens and perfect their creation through Thy power; Thou didst create the sun, the moon and the stars, and perfect their creation through Thy power; Thou didst create thunder and lightning, and cause water, snow and hail to descend from heaven through Thy will; Thou didst create the earth and the seas and perfect Thy creation therein through Thy might; Thou didst create that creation from a drop of water and perfect Thy creation therein, whereby Thou didst make it a complete human being; and Thou didst command Thy servants from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end to perfect whatsoever appeareth through their hands to the highest degree of perfection possible, for this is from the perfection of Thy handiwork, O Thou Lord of majesty, and from the consummate nature of Thy creation, O Thou the All-Compelling.Therefore, O my God, do Thou nurture the creation of the Bayan that no created thing may be found therein save that which manifesteth the attribute of craftsmanship to the utmost perfection, and protect, O my God, through Thy might and power, whomsoever may be veiled thereby, for Thou hast desired thereby to make the earth flourish through the wondrous crafts wrought by the hands of Thy servants and the sublime handiwork of Thy creation. O my God! Cause all Thy creation to attain such heights in their crafts as the Letters of the Gospel did attain in manifesting the signs of Jesus, Son of Mary, Thy Spirit and Thy Word, and the evidences of His Self, like unto Thy parables and Thy will. For Thou hast fashioned that creation through the perfection of Thy handiwork, the consummation of Thy creation, the completion of Thy crafts, the fulfillment of Thy work, and the sovereignty of all the wonders of Thy wisdom.Therefore, O my God, sharpen their vision regarding their crafts, elevate their sight concerning their innovations, make their hands gentle in what appeareth therefrom, and guide them to Thy religion in every Manifestation, for I have observed the various peoples of Thy creation upon the earth and have not witnessed any creation like unto the people of the Gospel in the perfection of their crafts and the wonder of their innovations. My heart hath grieved for them, O my God, for such as these ought not, through Thy bounty, to be content to be veiled from meeting Thee. Therefore, O my God, send forth one who will cause them to enter Thy religion, for they will follow in Thy path and be content with Thy way. Send down upon them, O my God, that which will cause them to enter Thy religion and refine their crafts through Thy grace, and make all Thy servants like unto them in the refinement of their crafts and the wonder of their innovations, whereby they produce from stone crystal of the purest kind. How many crafts, O my God, do they produce in Thy kingdom that ought to appear before Thee! Therefore, O my God, bless them through Thy guidance, for Thou hast ever been, O my God, one God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted, All-Ruling, All-Possessing, All-Glorious, All-Powerful, Who hath taken unto Himself no consort \[...\]

One, Single, Independent, Sole, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Most Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Most Exalted, Inaccessible, Most High, All-Subduing, All-Possessing, Most Glorious, All-Powerful! Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son, and there is no partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things through Thy power and ordained them through Thy wisdom, and Thou hast fashioned all things through Thy wisdom and made them according to Thy decree. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty over what Thou willest.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and hath ascended in His loftiness above all created things, and hath become inaccessible in His remoteness above all existing things, and hath exercised His sovereignty above all atoms, and hath manifested His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Perfect.He hath chosen for Himself an exalted Essence, resplendent Abstraction, sublime Simplicity, radiant Purity, glorious Identity, brilliant Manifestation, effulgent Luminosity, evident Clarity, majestic Grandeur, supreme Authority, mighty Dominion, and transcendent Sovereignty. Then He revealed Himself unto it through itself, and cast upon its reality the image of itself. Thus there appeared from it what was within it and upon it, and it filled the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Seven Letters and His Word are with Him.God hath chosen for Himself primary Names corresponding to the essential numbers of all things, and through them the heavens and earth and what lieth between them have been filled, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. There is none other God but Him, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon whosoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that the Divine Essence is an inaccessible mystery that none save Him can know, and when thou desirest to know Him, know Him through His Manifestation in every Revelation, for no other way is possible in the contingent world. Consider His likeness as the sun and all creation as mirrors reflecting it. This is evidence of His perfection - thou desirest a perfect mirror showing Him all-knowing and learned, thou seest One all-knowing and learned, and likewise with all names. And limit not the names to any number, for they are endless, extending from infinity to infinity in all things. And all that is realized in every Revelation are the manifestations of the Manifest One in that Revelation from His highest effulgence \[...\]

Whatever is realized in every Revelation through those Manifestations who appear in that Revelation, from the highest effulgence to the lowliest upbringing - for instance, look upon the earth: all must follow the religion of Muhammad. Thus you see in all that creation, from the name of sovereignty to the name of lowliness, both were created through the action of the Manifestations in that Revelation. This indicates His sovereignty and that indicates His lowliness. And if you are in the ocean of names, God is sanctified above all names and attributes, and if you are in the ocean of creation, Muhammad the Messenger of God commanded from the manifestation of sovereignty and lowliness and below them, for this is His very essence and that is His very essence. Do not let your understanding become imaginary in the air of your fancy.Therefore, in every Revelation, when the Sun of Truth dawns with a decree concerning the inhabitants of the previous Revelation, rendering them as naught - for instance, you see now how many people of the Gospel call upon God by His names and recite the Gospel, their Lord's Book, yet Muhammad the Messenger of God commanded their effacement. If they truly call upon God, how would God be pleased to efface one who calls upon Him? And if they recite God's Book, how would God be pleased to efface one who recites His Book? This is because they knew God in their fancy and recited His Book in their imagination. Otherwise, had they truly called upon God, they would not have been veiled from Muhammad the Messenger of God and would have recited the Furqan, the Book of their Creator.Therefore in every Revelation, the inhabitants of the previous Revelation are rendered as naught. O thou manifestation of perfection, perfect all thy craft and craftsmanship, and learn from that concerning the letters of the Gospel, such that thou mayest write from the Most Exalted Point what is possible therein of craftsmanship. I have given thee the part as an example that thou mayest know the whole from the part. Verily God hath cursed one who is capable of manifesting a craft in perfection yet manifests it imperfectly, and who loves for himself what he would purchase from another. How great is the Purchaser Who hath purchased that craft by His command and hath commanded His servants in the kingdom to purchase!O temples of humanity! Perfect what ye are capable of in your crafts lest God curse you for aught of your crafts after ye worship Him. God curseth you only as He Who God shall make manifest curseth, for the Essence is an unknowable mystery. Perchance there may be presented before Him Whom God shall make manifest some imperfectly crafted object, and He will curse its maker - this is what God hath cursed. Therefore fear God, O all ye possessors of crafts! But He forgiveth those who are being trained until they reach perfection. For example, when a child desires to learn calligraphy until he perfects his writing, all that he writes is forgiven, and verily God will bestow His blessings upon him until he reaches perfection. But when he attains the ability to write a single point, he will be held accountable: "After thy writing was perfected, why didst thou not perfect thy craft when thou wert capable thereof?"

Verily God will perfect him until he attains unto completion. And when he reacheth the point of inscribing a dot, it shall be asked of him: "After thy writing hath been perfected, why hast thou not perfected thy craft, when thou wert empowered to do so?" And if thou art unable to increase, then be content with less, for one beautiful beloved line is better than many lines that are not beautiful and beloved. And in this there is relief for the merchants and those who wish to make copies and desire haste therein. And in some cases ye are constrained - ye are pardoned for this. But God hath desired thereby to educate you in perfection. Otherwise it is equal before God whether thou makest that pen in the utmost perfection of craftsmanship or not. But if thou makest it with the utmost perfection, your souls will love it, and ye will have manifested the perfection of God's handiwork in that thing, and ye will have brought that thing to the utmost possible excellence through the bounty of thy Lord. And perchance that thing will one day be present before God, and He will be pleased with the one who made it. This is equal before Him, but ye are educated thereby until ye behold the day when all things on earth are brought to the utmost perfection through your own creation and the creation of what your hands produce. When the Dispensations have passed, ye shall behold Paradise with your own eyes in your life therein, wherein all things shall be without equal, peer, likeness, companion or similitude. And when ye engage in craftsmanship, recite: "Exalted above all craftsmen is the All-Crafting, the Most Artful One!" The creation of what ye fashion is perfected by your hands, and it hath four stages. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Powerful, the Most Powerful! There is no God but He, the Most Powerful, the Most Powerful! Say: God is more powerful than every possessor of power. None can withstand the sovereignty of His power, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Most Powerful, the Ever-Powerful. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Celestial Beauty, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who perisheth not, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God shall utterly destroy those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and shall bring upon them a grievous destruction. Likewise those who enter not themselves into the Bayan, or who enter therein and cause grief to anyone without right. And God is watchful over all things.Say: I have been strengthened by God, the One, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Glorious of the Most Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Resplendent, the Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Joyous, the Most Joyous. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Glorious, the Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the All-Beauteous, the All-Beauteous. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the All-Magnificent, the All-Magnificent. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Excellent, the Most Excellent. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the All-Magnificent, the Resplendent. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Glorious, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Joyous, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the All-Magnificent, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Most Luminous, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Glorious, the All-Glorious. Say: I have been strengthened by God, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious.These are the keys of knowledge concerning the number of all things. Thus have We given you nineteen prayers, each of which multiplieth according to the number of the One and then according to all things. This is of God's grace and mercy upon you, that ye may be thankful.Say: Knowledge is naught but your knowledge of God, and then of His names and attributes. Besides this there is no knowledge with God, nor in the Book, nor with them who are endowed with knowledge, O ye who fear God! Say: This is your knowledge of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and then of them that believe in Him, both men and women, that ye may deal kindly with them and aid them in the path of God. This is what profiteth from your knowledge. Otherwise, how can the mere learning of words benefit you on the Day of Resurrection when ye are veiled from their fruits?O ye who have striven in Islam and exalted yourselves above others, how is it that ye are not ashamed and do not reflect? Look ye upon the end of your strivings after seventy years, what fruit it hath yielded you, and what glory the believers have gained thereby. Watch over yourselves lest ye be veiled from the fruits of your knowledge, if ye be of them who are assured of God and His signs.God commandeth you to acquire knowledge and guidance, that ye may believe, on the Day of Resurrection, in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in what God shall reveal. Yea, verily, your glory lieth in that which giveth you delight when ye recite the verses and prayers, and ye comprehend their meaning, if ye act according to them and exalt not yourselves above others. For the most learned among you in the knowledge of God is he who is most humble and submissive before men, if ye be of them who truly strive.Say: The difference between these people and you is that ye learn words in Arabic while they do not learn them. Say: Ye and they are equal in respect to their fruits, if ye would but reflect upon the religion of God. How much have ye studied rhetoric and eloquence that ye might comprehend the eloquence and excellence of the verses!

Say: Praise be to God, Who hath caused you to recognize the eloquence of these verses and their fluency, that ye may comprehend. Say: Praise be to God, that ye have not understood the measure of a single letter, but when God revealeth a verse ye prostrate yourselves before Him. Then do ye recognize, in the presence of God, the supreme eloquence of His verses and the transcendence of His words. Say: Should all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them gather together to reveal the like of one verse from the Book of God in eloquence, they would never be able, nor would they have the power, even should ye ponder this throughout your lives with all your knowledge. Nay, your nature beareth witness to your powerlessness, and when it is purified for God's sake, no sooner doth it hear the verses of God than it testifieth that there is no God but Him. These are verses sent down from the presence of the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, even as the Primal Point spoke and bore witness. And they who are endowed with knowledge, when they heard the verses of God, testified with the knowledge of their hearts to the transcendence of God's eloquence, the exaltation of His utterance, and the powerlessness of all things before it, and they are among those who believe and are assured.Teach your children the science of grammar, then morphology, then the wisdom of the Bayan, then the science of letters, then talismans, if ye desire to attain unto the glory of knowledge. Say: The science of letters is the knowledge of the outward forms of words, and talismans are the science of their numerical values, from which cometh the science of calculation, if ye would learn aright. Say: The wisdom of the Bayan is that ye should learn the meaning of the words that were revealed in the Bayan, that ye may delight therein when ye recite them. Say: These sciences will profit you if ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest; otherwise they will not benefit you even to the extent of a mustard seed. Follow not what your predecessors have invented of your rhetoric, logic, principles, jurisprudence, astronomy, and mathematics, wherein ye spend the days of your lives. For none of these will profit you except to bar you from the remembrance of God. What will profit you is to know God and to attain unto His good-pleasure, if ye be of them that fear Him. This holdeth true until the Day of Resurrection, and on the Day of Resurrection ye should make all your knowledge center on Him Whom God shall make manifest and His good-pleasure, for this is what will yield fruit from all knowledge, if ye be sincere therein.Say: The sciences wherein ye take pride have been lifted from you, and ye have not been given permission to pursue them, for they profit you not with God and veil you from His remembrance on the Day of Resurrection, if ye do not witness these inventions before the Primal Point. Therefore ye are unable to believe in God and His verses, and ye cast yourselves into the fire thereby, and ye do not remember. Say: I have learned no knowledge save what He taught me from His presence - there is no God but I, and all else is My creation. Say: O My creation, worship ye Me! Say: I have made my knowledge to be of God and His good-pleasure, and this is My knowledge of what hath been vouchsafed unto Me from the good-pleasure of my Lord. O all things! By this shall ye be saved on the Day of Resurrection. Say: God hath prescribed that every soul should earn its own livelihood, each according to its capacity. This is of God's bounty.

This is My knowledge of what hath been bestowed upon Me through My Lord's good-pleasure. O all things! Through this Day of Resurrection shall ye be delivered. Say: God hath ordained that every soul must earn their living, each according to their capacity. This is through God's grace and mercy, that ye may not grieve in pursuit of your sustenance. Perchance there shall appear from your own means that which ye shall possess of God's dominion. This hath not been prescribed for your women - God hath freed them for your sakes and their own. This is God's favor unto them and unto you, that ye may be thankful. Yet God hath ordained that ye must earn what cometh to you in your days, that ye may provide. Blessed are they who seek their sustenance through what they earn in accordance with God's Book - they write upon the fairest path. Blessed are they who derive their sustenance from the ways of their knowledge of what was revealed in the Bayan, and who are assured in the remembrance of God. Say: That which God chose for Muhammad aforetime, then for Ali before Muhammad thereafter, was commerce, through which ye shall be enriched and exalted. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Send down the blessings of the heavens and earth and all between them upon those who engage in trade throughout the land while dealing justly in their commerce, who love for others what they love for themselves. O God! Exalt them, strengthen them, enrich them from Thy presence, preserve their souls and what Thou hast given them from the kingdom of Thy earth, and enable them to achieve their aims in their beginning and their end, as a grace from Thee. Verily, Thou hast power over all things. Say: Whoso tradeth in God's path, God hath guaranteed to enrich him - and who is more truthful in speech than God? Therefore make your trade to be in God, for that is your trade with Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye trade in truth. Say: God hath ordained for those who study the science of the Bayan, while seeking none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, that from every land the wealthy shall give unto them what they need to sustain themselves in their days. God hath guaranteed to multiply what the wealthy give in their lifetime, then cause them to enter Paradise after their death, if ye observe these ones and assist them. Say: O people of knowledge! Fear God, for We have provided for you through those whom We have enriched, that ye may be mindful on the Day of Resurrection of what We gave you from Our dominion, then believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and dispute not concerning what ye have learned, for ye tire yourselves in God's path only to return to your dwellings while honored, earning through your knowledge. We have given you the means to earn from your knowledge, that ye may feel ashamed on the Day of Resurrection, then believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and dispute not. We witnessed in that Resurrection none but the seekers from Kazimayn who benefited from their deeds, while ye were all veiled by your desires. Through their knowledge of the inner mysteries they sought the Truth and left their homes, whereupon God led them to the Manifestation of His Self and exalted their mention, as they believed in God and His signs among the worlds. Thus shall the special knowledge bear fruit in God's path. Therefore watch over yourselves lest ye be veiled by the principles ye devise.

Thus shall the specific knowledge bear fruit in the path of God. Therefore watch over yourselves lest ye be veiled by the rules ye devise while remaining veiled from the fruits of what was revealed in the Bayan. Say: All knowledge is your knowledge of God, and this shall not be manifest unto you except that ye make your knowledge to be of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and this shall not be manifest unto you except that ye make your knowledge to be of the verses of God from His presence. Then shall ye comprehend all knowledge. Besides this are veils upon veils adorning you, if ye turn not unto the path of truth. Say: God shall grant the reward of all things unto those learned ones who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in His words, and who attain unto certitude. And verily God shall visit the punishment of all things upon those learned ones who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in His words, and who attain not unto certitude. Therefore, O people of learning, have mercy upon yourselves, for if ye remain veiled ye shall bear the fire of all things, and what shall harm you shall be greater than what shall benefit you. Then shall ye attain unto all reward. Let not the conditions of your multiplicity veil you from the essence of knowledge and wisdom, for it is but one Word: "There is no God but God," then His proof is Him Whom God shall make manifest - all are created by His command from God. God hath created no knowledge save that ye might comprehend this, and no knowledge hath appeared before except from this. We have given you the essence of essences in your knowledge and wisdom that ye might be saved on the Day of Resurrection. Say: Nothing is devoid of the twenty-eight letters, were ye to reflect thereon. Say: The essence of these letters returneth unto the One - ye witness these nine between the knowing and the all-knowing. Say: When God desireth to make the letters an essence, He concealeth nine within the One, then it appeareth in the Book that verily there is no God but He, the All-Knowing \[...\]

In His Name, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! There is no God but He, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted! Say: God is more exalted than any possessor of exaltation. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His exalted sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been the supreme Exalter, the most exalted One.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are humbly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God shall assuredly mock those who enter not the Bayan and who, if they do enter it, act not according to its prescribed limits. Say: What mockery can be greater than this, O people, that ye imagine ye worship God while God mocketh you for worshipping other than Him? If ye worship God, how is it that ye worship Us not in the Bayan? The companions of Him Whom God shall make manifest shall assuredly mock those who have been given the Bayan, seeing them at the height of their piety seeking God's good pleasure while remaining veiled from God Who created them and from His good pleasure, yet thinking they do good.Say: Every mockery that He Whom God shall make manifest displayeth, that is God's mockery of you. O people, fear ye God's mockery! And whoso mocketh a believing man or believing woman disobeyeth God his Lord, and must instantly seek God's forgiveness ninety-five times, and if able must give nineteen mithqals of gold, or else of silver according to God's Book's limit, that ye may mock no one and grieve none. And whoso is unable is pardoned if he seeketh God's forgiveness, for God is the Forgiving, the Merciful.O people, all that hath been revealed in the Bayan is living, whether of light or fire. Think not there is death in them, for ye behold their life. And that which ye know not, ye are not charged with \[...\]

Those that you know not are not charged as the First One. You know them not, but you can know those who follow them, and they guide not to other than God. And verily you see not the gates of fire in themselves but you shall see their like in those who transgress the bounds of God. Make not what was revealed in the Bayan as dead. Say: Verily it is alive like unto yourselves, nay rather your life is through what was revealed in the Bayan, if you would but reflect a little. Say: You know not the Primal Point nor the First Life, but you are certain that they are alive in the creation of the Bayan, beholding you and interceding for you with God if you elevate their stations to the utmost of your ability, and thereupon when you are able, attend in glory. Say: Verily such a one is fire, alive in the Book of God, but you know them not. If you curse them they hear themselves and are tormented thereby. Say: On the Day of Resurrection one of fire and light shall be made manifest through Him Whom God shall make manifest on that Day through what God reveals and ordains as you shall see. Say: All that was revealed in the Bayan concerning the mention of the Name and the creation of the Bayan, if you would but reflect a little. And all that God hath revealed - these are they who in the Bayan are called fire and on the Day of Resurrection through Him Whom God shall make manifest they shall emerge. Likewise all that was revealed in the Bayan concerning the light - these are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest yet on the Day of His manifestation they give not thanks. Say: Verily the Bayan is alive and living, holding both paradise and fire, and both are established through it and both were believers in it. But on the Day of Resurrection through Him Whom God shall make manifest, God will distinguish between them and show you all good if you appear among the proofs of faith, and show you all your curses upon those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest though they be counted among the believers. This is the proof of the Bayan if you would bear witness to the truth. And whosoever is veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, though he ascend in piety to the highest horizon - that is the negation of the Bayan. You shall seek refuge with Him Whom God shall make manifest from such as these. But God hath drawn a veil over you in the Bayan, therefore lift not God's veil over you before the Day of Resurrection while you enjoy the shelter of the veil and delight therein. Think not of yourselves save as paradise in your nights until the Day of Resurrection. Then He Whom God shall make manifest will make you know His Self, and then through what He reveals from His presence you shall know. If He declares one who was not the highest in the Bayan to be fire, you shall be certain of it, for this is the Word of God in the Bayan if you be believers therein. And if He declares one who was not the lowest to be light, then hold fast to it and be certain, for this is the Word in the Bayan if you be believers therein. And before the Day of Resurrection cause not grief to anyone among you.

O ye divines of the Bayan! Let none amongst you cause grief to another, nor lift your veil and remove your covering. Rather, conceal yourselves even as God hath concealed you, for among you is He Whom God shall make manifest, then the First Living One, then the Gates of God, though ye know it not. And if anyone in the Bayan should transgress the bounds of God, nineteen mithqals of gold shall be required of him as a penalty from God, that ye may not reject one another. Thus doth God unite you and gather you unto guidance and righteousness. Fear ye God and reject not one another. For whosoever saith "There is no God but God" and "Verily the Bayan is a Book from God" - we were believers in what was revealed therein concerning Ali before Muhammad. When one dons the garment of the Bayan, reject him not. Should they transgress any of God's bounds, say: "He hath disobeyed God his Lord," but judge not that he hath departed from the Faith, for what establisheth your religion is what We have revealed in that verse, that ye may not grieve and may not reject one another.O divines of the Bayan! Reject not one another in your questions, for God your Lord hath strictly forbidden this. Speak with modesty and write with modesty. If ye witness against anyone at a lower degree while placing yourselves at a higher degree, attract him with gracious words. For throughout your nights ye are magnified in God's shelter and protection, but on the first Day of Resurrection ye shall be tested. Should ye err in your questions and God wish to pardon you, naught shall diminish from your merit. Believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may correct all wherein ye err. But if ye err not even by a single letter in your words, yet should God wish to cast you into the fire and nullify your deeds, none could prevent it.Should ye be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest even to the extent of saying "yea," ye will have grievously erred in all your questions. For all your questions branch from your faith in God your Lord, and by being veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, your faith shall be lifted from you. Therefore watch over yourselves, for ye are heedless of the elements of your religion while remaining veiled from Him Who created you and your religion and your questions.How many were the servants who, in the Gospel, were pious in their religion and advanced in their questions, seeking to please themselves in their temples by attaining the good pleasure of Jesus. Yet when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came to them, they veiled themselves from Him Who created them and their religion, and caused themselves and their followers to enter \[the fire\] by not believing in Muhammad, the Apostle of God. Had they caught a whiff from Jesus' successors they would have exalted themselves and boasted, yet when they found One Who was better in God's sight than Jesus and Who could create the like of Jesus' successors by His word, they imprisoned Him until God granted Him victory through His believing servants. And the like of this ye witness in the Bayan. Therefore watch over yourselves, for ye \[...\]

In the Bayan, concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest, walk ye not in paths whereby ye fail to recognize Him, lest ye be forever bereft of attainment. Take heed that ye cause sorrow to no one, that ye may be rightly guided and dwell in peace. On the Day of Resurrection, in relation to Him Whom God shall make manifest, follow no paths save those of glory and love. Consider ye the Bayan, for verily We have barred against you the gates of your destruction on the Day of Resurrection, and have opened unto you the gates of your salvation on that Day, that ye may not through yourselves and your possessions devise falsehood, but rather hold fast unto God through His verses and aid the Cause of God.If ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest for sovereignty, behold, there are countless kings upon the earth - how then could this divert you from the good-pleasure of your Lord? Reflect ye a little! And if ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest for riches, lo, there are numberless wealthy ones upon the earth - how then could this distract you from God, your Lord, and aught of His good-pleasure? Would that ye would reflect a little! And if ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest for armies, behold, there are countless hosts upon the earth - how then could this turn you away from God and His good-pleasure? Would that ye would reflect a little!And if ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily the means of your enrichment lie within your grasp. With God there is naught save clear verses, if ye seek Him. Through these He confirmeth your religion and teacheth you His good-pleasure, if ye truly desire Him. And if ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest that He may grant you offspring, behold, the means thereof are in your right hand, and ye possess the keys thereof. And whatsoever ye desire from Him Whom God shall make manifest, apart from God, exists on earth with you. Therefore associate not anything with God, your Lord, by desiring from Him Whom God shall make manifest anything other than His Self and His good-pleasure, if ye wish to be truly unified. If ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest for aught save God, while sanctifying God in truth, then verily We find you \[...\]

The earth belongs to those who believe in divine unity. If thou lovest all things, then the means thereto are upon the earth, save for the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for that is in the hand of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. When He willeth, He shall manifest Him as He pleaseth with signs and evidences. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.If ye desire Him Whom God shall make manifest as the inheritance of all the Prophets together, then what ye create by your hands upon the earth is higher than what was with the Prophets before. Therefore consider your affair, then ponder upon the truth. All the inheritance of the Prophets from the means they possessed are means which shall be gathered unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, be it but a pen, ink, and paper.Ye look not to what the Prophets were, but rather to what is attributed to them. Therefore sharpen your vision, for the Prophets were created only from what God revealed unto them of verses. Thus all verses are with Him Whom God shall make manifest in a single verse, if ye would but reflect a little. Say: All the Prophets, the Successors, the Martyrs and the believers in the Bayan are in naught else, if ye but knew. God hath made naught besides the Bayan to be true. How then could the Prophets, the Successors, the Martyrs and those brought nigh be in any paradise save this? Therefore consider your affair, then remember.This holdeth true until the Day of Him Whom He shall make manifest. On that Day, all who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest shall prostrate before Him. Should God wish, He would create through the command of Him Whom God shall make manifest countless Prophets, Successors, Martyrs and those brought nigh, if ye believe in Him and are certain. God is verily powerful and mighty over this.But since ye are veiled on the Day of His manifestation, it behooveth you not to don those exalted mantles. Rather, the Command of God is nearer than all things, if ye seek it from Him Whom God shall make manifest, not in the atmosphere of your vain imaginings, for ye comprehend nothing. Though ye call upon God throughout your lives, ye hear not God's call nor respond. This is evident in the Book. But if ye call upon God on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest and direct your supplication to Him Whom God shall make manifest, God will answer you more quickly than the twinkling of an eye with clear signs, whereby ye will be convinced that this is the Word of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.All who are on earth call upon God, their Lord, at all times, before and after, yet not one of their supplications is answered since they direct not their petitions to the Primal Point. And even if they were to reach the Primal Point more quickly than the twinkling of an eye, God would not answer them that they might hear. Say: God hath ever been Living, hearing the words of those who call upon Him, but the throne from which the answer must come is none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, and before the Day of Resurrection ye hear not. And verily God prolongeth your night that He might cast you into the fire of remoteness, that ye might purify yourselves for the Day of nearness. Yet on the Day of nearness ye appear more remote than the night. Ye follow all who lead you to something of your desires \[...\]

Yet on the Day of nearness ye appear more remote than night itself. Ye follow all who lead you to the attainment of your desires, but follow not the Messenger of God among you who would guide you unto God, your Lord, and unto His good-pleasure, though ye have spent your entire lives professing love for God and seeking His good-pleasure. Thus doth God expose your falsity, that ye might recall this in the next life and bear true witness. Say: Assert not that a thousand souls are born and die each day, for ye cannot reckon this. Say: All whose seed is formed proceed from Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all whose spirit is taken return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is your beginning from God and your return unto Him, did ye but reflect. Say: All things declare "I am from God" through Him Whom God shall make manifest as their beginning, and all things declare "I return unto God" through Him Whom God shall make manifest as their end. And there are four degrees. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Succourer, the Succouring! There is no God but He, the Succourer, the Succouring! Say: God is the Supreme Succourer above all succourers. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can resist the dominion of His succouring sovereignty. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath been the Succourer, the Succouring, the All-Succouring. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and between them. Say: All bow down in worship unto Him. And praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and on earth and between them do glorify. Say: All stand in devotion unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Force and the Sublimity, then the Sovereignty and the Realm of Creation. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supremely Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Say: God will succour you on the Day of Resurrection through Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye cry for succour unto God, your Lord, the All-Merciful. Say: He is the Subduer above you, the Manifest over you, the Inaccessible at your right hand, the Exalted at your left, the Transcendent above your heads, the All-Powerful beneath your feet, and the Omnipotent on every side, Who turneth you by night and by day through His command. Verily He is powerful, mighty and all-compelling. Unto Him submit all who are in the heavens and on earth.

Say: All who dwell on earth shall return unto God. Say: He is the Subduer, supreme over His creation, the Omnipotent, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is manifest above His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are His worshippers, all are within His grasp, and all are His servants. Say: Sovereignty belongeth unto God, Who is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. He hath taken unto Himself neither consort nor offspring. All in the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify Him, and all in the realm of command and creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them bow down in adoration before Him. Magnify ye Him and extol Him with exceeding greatness. Recite ye this verse at noontide that ye may attain unto all good. Say: God hath revealed no name greater than this Name through which ye draw nigh unto God, your Lord. Say: If ye cry unto God for help, He will help you. God is the Supreme Succourer, the One to Whom all appeal for aid. Unto Him belongeth the splendor of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Glorious, the Resplendent, the Most Beauteous. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the Sublime, the August.

Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the majesty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the Sublime, the August. Nothing whatsoever in the heavens or on earth or in whatsoever lieth between them can ever escape His knowledge. Verily, He hath knowledge of all things. Nothing whatsoever in the heavens or on earth or in whatsoever lieth between them can ever frustrate Him. Verily, He hath power over all things. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God hath power over all things. Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Powerful, the Inaccessible, the Supreme Ruler.

Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the beauty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is Beauty, the Source of Beauty, the Most Beautiful. Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the greatness of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Most Great, the Source of Greatness, the Magnificent. Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the mercy of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Merciful, the Source of Mercy, the Compassionate. Unto God, the King, the Sovereign, belongeth the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them, and God is the Supreme Ruler, the Sovereign, the Almighty.

Say: I have been glorified through God, the One, the Succorer, unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the One, the All-Compelling.The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Succorer, the Succorer. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee.

And all things testify that verily Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without peer, Thine is the Kingdom and the celestial dominion, Thine the power and divine realm, Thine the might and heavenly realm, Thine the dominion and earthly realm, Thine is the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the visage and perfection, Thine the strength and action, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the might and justice, Thine the parable and similes, Thine the stations and exaltation, Thine the grandeur and independence, Thine the glory and sovereignty, Thine the might and invincibility, Thine the power and transcendence, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the dominion and authority, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever existed before all contingent things, manifest above all beings, exalted above all creation, invincible above all atoms, transcendent above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, sovereign above all creation, mighty above all that Thou hast created or wilt create through signs and words. Thou hast ever been knowing of all things and powerful over all things. Nothing escapeth Thy knowledge and nothing defeateth Thy power. All Thy servants are in Thy grasp, that all in the kingdom of Thy heaven and earth may worship Thee through the merit of Thy oneness, and all in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation may prostrate before Thee through the merit of Thy unity, that all atoms may magnify Thee through the exaltation of Thy self-subsistence, that all in the kingdoms of earth and heaven may glorify Thee through the sublimity of Thy grandeur, that they may be in awe of Thy might and flee unto Thee in fear, that they may be detached unto Thee through the transcendence of Thy singleness, that they may prostrate before Thee through the exaltation of Thine eternity, and cry for help unto Thee through the appeal to Thy succoring grace. Glory be unto Thee! Thou didst maintain the Furqan and its people for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, then didst Thou reveal the Bayan through Thy power. O God, maintain it through the sovereignty of Thy oneness and the dominion of Thy unity until Thou shall present it unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, prostrate before Him. O God, send down upon Him, after Thou has caused to pass the number of Waw, whatsoever good Thou hast encompassed, and if Thou art able to raise Him to Thy most exalted names and most resplendent examples - the Name of Him Who is Invoked for Help - then that is of Thy grace, Thy generosity, Thy bounty, Thy favor and Thy kindness. And if Thou dost reveal the Cause from Thee sooner than this, then the Command is in Thy hands. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Thou shalt not be questioned about what Thou doest, but all shall be questioned about everything. Thou hast ever existed before all things, and after all things, and as the Creator of all things, and the Essence after all things, and as the All-Knowing, the Invincible with all things. Thou hast ever been God \[...\]

O Thou Who hast been and wilt ever be with all things, Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Possessing, Holy, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted, Supreme, All-Powerful, Manifest, Compelling, All-Glorious, Majestic, Most Great, Luminous, Self-Sufficient, All-Succoring, Most Great, Perfect, All-Conquering, Mighty, Noble, All-Knowing, Well-Pleased, Chosen, Honored, Most High, Gracious, Subduing. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them according to Thy decree. By Thy Will Thou hast formed all things and shaped them according to Thy wisdom. How exalted art Thou above Thy creation, how inaccessible above Thy servants, how powerful above Thy creatures, how compelling above all who dwell in the kingdom of Thy heaven and earth, and how succoring above all things! Glory be to Thee! Exalted and sanctified are all Thy names, and elevated are Thy examples in all that they contain and represent. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the All-Succoring, the All-Succoring! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all contingent beings, Who hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all existing things, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all created things, Who hath empowered Himself in His power above all atoms, Who hath made Himself sovereign in His sovereignty above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, Who hath made Himself victorious in His victory above all atoms, Who hath made Himself compelling in His compelling might above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, Who hath made Himself mighty in His might above all contingent beings, Who hath made Himself majestic in His majesty above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and Who hath made Himself glorious in His glory above all existing things. Thus do all His creatures testify that there is none other God but Him, the Single One, the All-Succoring. He hath chosen His inaccessible essence, His glorious abstraction, His lofty camphor-like nature, His manifest simplicity, and His magnificent appearance. Then He revealed Himself to it through it, and through it He became inaccessible from it, and that which is in its identity is the likeness of itself. Thus there appeared from it what was within it and upon it of holy signs, mighty manifestations, wondrous revelations, signs of His unity and tokens of His succoring nature, filling thereby the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but Him and that the One of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. He hath chosen for Himself primary, essential names, then immersed them in the limitless, eternal ocean, whereupon existence was filled from the kingdom of the unseen and then the empire of the visible, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the Fourth: In the Name of God, the All-Succoring, the All-Succoring! Praise be to God, there is none other God but Him, the All-Succoring, the All-Succoring. And verily all glory be from God upon the Primal Unity.

And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Unity. And furthermore I testify that there is no Succourer save God, exalted be His glory, and no Helper, exalted be His majesty. And if thou art overtaken by a need or purpose, then recite two thousand and forty-one times "O God, the Helper!" For verily God will answer thee and will cause the angels of might and mercy to descend upon thee, that they may reveal unto thee what thou desirest of thy need and purpose, if thy desire be a purpose purely for God, exalted be His glory, and detached unto Him, exalted be His majesty. For verily He, glorified be His praise, nothing escapeth His knowledge, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them, nor is He frustrated by anything whether in the kingdom of Command or Creation or whatsoever is beneath them. When thou callest upon Him with pure devotion, He will answer thee more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Succouring, the All-Aiding, the All-Helping, the All-Bountiful, the All-Bestowing, the All-Gracious, the All-Conquering, the All-Subduing, the All-Victorious, the All-Protecting, the All-Restraining, the All-Defending, the All-Compelling, the All-Subjugating, the All-Potent, the All-Determining, the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty. And He hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Effectual Effect. There is no God but He, the Most Effectual, the Most Effective. Say: God is more effectual than all who possess effect. None can resist the sovereign power of His influence, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath ever been the Most Effectual, the Most Effective, the Most Influential. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom bow down in devotion whosoever is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who perisheth not, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been powerful over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God manifesteth the influence of what He hath created by His command, and there is no good but that it is attributed to the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, and whatsoever is beneath that is created by God but not attributed unto Him. Through God ye shall be preserved from that which ye love. Say: God is the Creator of all things.

Say: Nothing can be attributed to Him. Through God do ye protect what ye love. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto God do all return. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and verily unto Him do all turn. Say: God giveth life and causeth death, and all stand firm by His command. Say: God is my Lord and your Lord, therefore worship Him, for this is the straight and impregnable path. Say: He is manifest above His creation, and He is the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. There is nothing that can be mentioned by the name of anything else, and everything hath its effect - all grieve for all, all rejoice for all, and all benefit from the effect of all. But God hath created all things that their effects might be manifested in the path of His good-pleasure. Observe ye not in yourselves the effects of anything outside the path of His good-pleasure. Desire ye not to see them, but rather manifest the effects of all things according to what God hath created therein, that ye may be rewarded for what ye earn. Say: Verily God sendeth down in every aspect of His name nineteen verses, that ye may reflect upon the numbers of all things. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Thou art the Effect. Verily, the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them are created to produce effects in all things. Thou withholdest effects from whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou raisest up whom Thou willest, and Thou sendest down what Thou willest, and Thou exaltest whom Thou willest, and Thou hidest from Thy glory whom Thou willest. Within Thy grasp lies the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Thou art the Effects of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou givest to whom Thou willest the effects of the most exalted ones in the Book, and Thou givest less than the effects of the most exalted ones in the Book, and Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art All-Knowing, All-Wise. Say: God's Effect is above all who possess effects. None in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them can withhold themselves from the sovereign power of His effects. Verily, He is the Most Effectual, the Most Influential, the Most Effective. Unto God belong the effects of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and God is the Most Effectual, the Most Influential, the Most Effective. \[...\]

Verily there is no God but Him, the Unique, the All-Affecting. To God belong the wondrous traces in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. God hath two traces: an ethereal trace. To God belong the traces of all that He hath created and will create. God hath affecting, ethereal traces. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Verily Thou art the Trace of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou bestowest the trace upon whomsoever Thou willest in Thy good-pleasure, and withholdest the trace from whomsoever Thou willest in Thy fire. Verily Thou art the Observer over all things. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Verily Thou art the Trace. Verily those who leave traces create the trace as they will and ordain as they please. Thou hast not ordained for anyone, before or after, save what Thou lovest of the traces of Thy good-pleasure. And whoso veils himself, Thy proof is completed against him, and verily Thou art the Most Exalted Trace above all the worlds.Say: All that hath left traces by God's command is created, and God hath created naught wherein He hath not ordained a trace, save that ye shall turn unto the exaltation of the Primal Point before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then shall the traces of all things be directed to the inaccessibility of the Word of God. Say: All shall proclaim that we have no trace except through God, and verily God hath forbidden us to manifest our traces save in the path of His good-pleasure, and hath forbidden unto us traces apart from the path of His good-pleasure. Thus hath He created us and taken from us the covenant. O ye who possess spirits! All good lieth in the path ye shall follow, and apart from this there shall be no trace. Ye are prevented from the path, for verily We were, in what We created, helpers that ye might, in what ye were created for, desire to acquire. God is the Subduer above all things, and Manifest above the trace of all things, and verily He hath power over all things.There is no originator of traces save God. Will ye not then believe in God and His signs? There is no reliever save God. Will ye not then call upon Him? Say: Verily God shall deliver you from every sorrow and shall send down unto you from His presence that which shall gladden your hearts. God is verily powerful and mighty over that. Say: God sufficeth us, He Who hath created us and provided for us and caused us to die and brought us to life. He is our Lord, in Him do we trust, and verily in God let the believing servants put their trust. Say: Verily God hath created naught and ordained for it no word save for the exaltation of His remembrance and the inaccessibility of His Word. Thus do ye apprehend and judge from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end. Say: Praise be to God Who hath created all things in relation to Him, that they might be elevated above all else beneath Him, and with Him is the glory of all things in the Book, if ye would make yourselves manifest through Him Whom God shall make manifest, then manifest traces of good in the path, and apart from truth make no mention. How do ye desire to acquire? The Second in the Second. In the Name of God, the Trace, the Trace. Glory be unto Thee, O God, my God! I testify \[...\]

Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and the sovereignty, Thine the grandeur and the majesty, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the face and the perfection, Thine the likeness and the similitudes, Thine the stations and the glory, Thine the power and the action, Thine the mercy and the grace, Thine the authority and the justice, Thine the greatness and the independence, Thine the pride and the splendor, Thine the might and the exaltation, Thine the power and the ascendancy, Thine the joy and the gladness, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been the Being before all things, the Essence after all things, the Creator of all things, and the Reality after all things. Sanctified are all Thy names and exalted are Thy examples in all that they contain and express. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, self-subsisting, living, everlasting, sovereign, supreme, holy, enduring, eternal, self-dependent, transcendent, inaccessible, exalted, all-powerful. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hath there been any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. Through Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them with precision, and through Thy will Thou hast formed all things and fashioned them with perfection. Thou hast ever been dominant over all contingent beings, manifest above all existing things, inaccessible above all created things, transcendent above all atoms, sovereign over all that is in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and mighty above all that Thou hast created and wilt create through signs and evidences. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and ascended in His elevation above all existing things, and become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, and manifested His power above all created things, and revealed His appearance above all that is in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and demonstrated His dominion above all existing things, and established His sovereignty above whosoever is in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, so that all His creation testifieth that there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Luminous, and He hath chosen an exalted Essence and a radiant Abstraction \[...\]

The pure, resplendent, lofty essence and radiant, transcendent reality then became manifest unto it through itself, and through itself withdrew from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Thus there appeared from it what was within and upon it, wherewith were filled the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, testifying that there is no God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. He chose for Himself primary, essential names, then immersed them in the sea of primary infinity, whereupon existence was filled from the kingdom of the unseen and the dominion of the visible, bearing witness that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Trace, the Trace. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Trace, the Trace. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One.I testify that there is no influence in existence save God, exalted be His glory, and no administrator save Him, mighty be His might. Be not veiled from the trace of anything, for verily it was created by God's command. God hath created naught but that it hath a trace. Look not upon anything and its trace with the eye of insignificance, for everything and its trace in its station is greater than all that is great, if thou regardest it with an elevated and discerning eye.Behold the pen and its glory - what thing it is! Then look at its trace, for thousands upon thousands appear through its trace when thou writest. Thus must thou look upon all things. Be not veiled from its trace, for the trace of everything in its place is as the trace of the greater world. All subsist through God and all return unto God.The trace of a thing appeareth not save through God's good-pleasure. For if thou expendest that thing other than in God's good-pleasure, it and its trace will surely curse thee, for God created it and its trace to be expended in the path of His good-pleasure toward His loved ones. Be not veiled from that thing, for the Truth and aught else is established thereby. And when He Whom God shall make manifest appeareth, be thou among those influenced by lofty, transcendent traces that appear in God's path, for this verily is the great bounty.O My Name among the two Names! The first Gate of the first Unity of the first Day of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name. Verily it hath four stations. The first concerneth the mention of its elements, whereby it draweth sustenance from God through the verses. In the Name of God, the Most Named, the Most Named. There is no God but Him, the Most Named, the Most Named. Say: God is Most Named above every possessor of names. None in the heavens or earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape from the sovereignty of His names. Verily He is the All-Naming, the Most Supreme, the Most Exalted. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and unto Whom all return. Glorified be He Whom all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them do praise \[...\]

Glorified be He Who knoweth what is in the heavens and on earth and what is between them, and unto Him do all return. Glorified be He Who created all things by His command, and by His command do all stand firm. He is the One Who originateth what He willeth through His command "Be," and it is. He is the One Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him do all return. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. His is whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are His worshippers. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and unto Him do all return. He it is in Whose grasp is the dominion of all things. All the worlds shall glorify His remembrance. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Manifest above His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. He it is Who causeth the night and the day to alternate by His command. Is not His the creation and the command? We are all His worshippers.Say: O God! Thou art the Name of Names. Thou shalt name whomsoever Thou willest as Thou willest by Thy command. Thou art the Best of those who give names. Name me, then, with that whereby I may guide unto Thee. Thou art, verily, powerful over all things. We have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and given thee life and named thee from Our presence a name for all the worlds. We have sent down concerning thee that which shall guide unto Me, for We are powerful. We have ordained for thee from Our presence such names wherein thou shalt behold none save Us, for We are All-Knowing. Thou shalt indeed guide unto God, thy Lord, before all names. This is from God's grace upon thee and upon the glorifying angels who glorify their Lord by night and by day and who tire not.O Letter Alif! Glorify thy Lord and say: Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I have been of those who glorify. Then O Letter Sin! Praise God, thy Lord, and say: Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I have been of those who praise. Then O Letter Mim! Proclaim the unity of God, thy Lord, and say: Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I have been of those who proclaim Thy unity. Then O Letter Mim! Magnify God, thy Lord, and say: Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I have been of those who magnify.We have made thee a mirror wherein naught shall be seen except My remembrance, as a token from Us, for We are the Revealer. We have permitted those who mention thee to emphasize the Mim in thy remembrance. This is from God's grace upon the sanctified ones who love to recite the verses of their Lord in such wise that all are drawn when they hear. Let no word be altered for him who wisheth to recite the Book of his Lord. This is from God's grace upon all the worlds. Say: Through God all are knowing. Say: In the Name of God all do begin. Say: God hath revealed no Book but it beginneth with the mention of His Name. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: All enter into the Truth through what God hath ordained for me, and all enter through me the gates of Paradise. Whosoever mentioneth me without believing in God, his Lord, My remembrance shall not be lawful unto him. Thus hath God purified me from all save the believers.

I bear witness before God, my Lord and the Lord of all things, that there is no God but Him - His are the most beautiful names from before and after, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then I bear witness before God to the Point of the Bayan, then the Letters of the Living, then to whomever points to that Unity wherein naught is seen except him upon whom God hath sent down the Bayan. These indeed are the believing servants of God. Verily the Bayan is God's proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and we are witnesses therein over whoso maketh mention of God's name and is among the believers in God and His verses.The Second Gate concerning the mention of his spirit which draweth sustenance from God through prayersIn the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most ExaltedGlorified art Thou, O my God! I bear witness before Thee and before all things that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the sovereignty, Thine the power and divinity, Thine the strength and majesty, Thine the dominion and the realm, Thine the glory and grandeur, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the face and perfection, Thine the might and deeds, Thine the similitude and parables, Thine the mercy and grace, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the greatness and sublimity, Thine the bounty and favor, Thine the loftiness and elevation, Thine the power and invincibility, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the tribulation and detachment, Thine the grandeur and majesty, Thine is all that is seen and unseen from the highest heights to the first speck of dust.I bear witness that Thou art the Creator of all things, the Provider of all things, the One Who causeth all things to die and giveth life to all things. Thou hast no partner in Thy Essence, nor in Thy Attributes, nor in Thy Actions. Worship is not meet save for Thee alone, there is no God but Thee. I bear witness before Thee and before all things that every object of worship besides Thee, from the highest heights to the first speck of dust, is vain and perishable. Verily Thou alone, there is no God but Thee.And I bear witness that Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the King Who changeth not, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Single One Who escapeth not. Creation is Thy creation and command is from Thee, then unto Thee. I shall glorify Thee beyond all that contingent beings have glorified or shall glorify Thee, and I shall sanctify Thee beyond all that existent things have sanctified or shall sanctify Thee, and I shall declare Thee free from all that created things have unified or shall unify Thee, and I have magnified Thee above what all atoms have magnified or shall magnify Thee. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Unique, Eternal, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Everlasting, Independent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. All things shall prostrate before Thee, all things shall glorify Thy praise, all things shall worship Thee.

Let all things serve Thee, let all things be cut off from aught else save Thee, let all things begin from Thee, and let all things end in Thee. Verily I have adduced proof in Thy Manifestation through the manifestation of Him upon Whom Thou didst send down Thy verses, inasmuch as all that is endowed with existence in the Bayan derives its being through Him, and verily His Essence belongeth to Thee alone, there is no God but Thee. Were the Cause to be from that Manifestation, none would have been made a partner with the Manifestation of Thy Self, that I might adduce proof thereby from Thee unto infinity, and beyond infinity, testifying that the Command and Creation are in Thy hands alone, there is no God but Thee. Were anyone to have access to Thy Manifestation, it must needs be revealed through Thy Manifestation in the Bayan, and were anyone to possess any attribute of existence, it must needs be revealed before Thou revealest it on the Day of Resurrection through the verses. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! All things receive their existence through the manifestation of One like unto Thee, for were it not so, nothing would possess the capacity of existence. Every thing awaiteth Thy subsequent Manifestation, for that is the realm of the hereafter in the presence of the angels of the divine cloud and those who glorify Thee above the throne of light. Glory be unto Thee, there is no God but Thee! Grant sustenance to the letter Sin through Thy most exalted sustenance, even as Thou didst create the letter Alif through Thy most mighty verses, for there is no creator besides Thee nor any sustainer apart from Thee. Thou hast created me with the most exalted potentiality in creation and sustained me with the most exalted means in invention, being certain that there is no God but Thee, before and after, and being assured that there is no God but Thee in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. I shall seek Thy forgiveness, O my God, in every condition, and I shall turn unto Thee at every moment, and through Thee shall I be independent, and upon Thee shall I rely, and there is no strength nor power except through Thee alone, there is no God but Thee. Glory be unto Thee! Verily I have been of them that glorify Thee, and glory be unto Thee! Verily I have been of them that praise Thee.The Third Gate concerning the mention of His Self, Who deriveth sustenance from God through words immune from interpretation. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Praise be unto Him Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and cast therein such signs of His power as prove from their beginning unto their end that there is no God but He, the Overseer, the Self-Subsisting. Then glory be unto Him upon Whom God hath sent down the Bayan in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, with such proofs from its beginning unto its end that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Bear thou witness that this Third Letter betokeneth the Pillar of Divine Authority, and that its manifestations in the First Unity are manifest in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Thereafter none can reckon its manifestations or comprehend unto infinity what hath no end, from itself unto itself. Were God to place the seas of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them under the shadow of a single one of those Manifestations, they would surely adduce proof concerning them of the sublimity of holiness and shadow, and the exaltation of glory and majesty, even as thou hast witnessed aforetime in the Book. Consider the pillars of the word of Unity from before: were it the day of the manifestation of but one of them, he would guide through his guidance all who are on earth and cause them to enter the paradise of God's good-pleasure.

Through each one of them shall be guided those who are on earth, that they may enter the paradise of God's good-pleasure. They shall indeed guide men unto God in such ways as are possible with God, and shall attain certitude that the Return is manifest in His own Self, then through the Spirit, then through the Text, then through him who is of the essence, the camphor-like, the pure, the detached one, and likewise from the beginning of the Cause unto God. Even so in the Manifestation doth he appear by God's leave. And if the response indicateth in the End what was in the Beginning, it would be primary, and if the Beginning in the End, it would be ultimate. This is when thou observest the aspects of limitation in the formal temples that give tidings of the divine essences, that rise from the primal realities, that indicate the manifestations of oneness, that seek shelter in the shade of the Tree of Singleness. And what shall profit thee in that station on the Day of Resurrection is when thou witnessest the appearance of Truth and hearest the verses and words of God. Then shalt thou be wholly attracted by the Primary Letters from among the Manifestations of Unity. For if thou followest any one of those Manifestations, it shall profit thee as naught else can profit thee. But in the darkest night thou shalt observe in the Bayan who it is whose deeds match what God hath revealed therein. Consider him among the manifestations of the divine ipseities; otherwise We shall assuredly banish him with banishment. Beware, beware on the Day of Resurrection of this path, for on that Day the essences of negation shall be transformed into affirmation, and those of affirmation into negation, even as thou hast witnessed in the Point of the Bayan. It is as though I behold the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, how the souls in the Bayan have ascended to the most exalted height and the most glorious summit, how they have soared in exaltation of praise of the Primary Letters. Yet before their recognition of them, no judgment floweth upon them concerning outer forms save through inner paths. God is too glorious and exalted to question His servants before teaching them the ways of His good-pleasure and the places of His knowledge. But after thy recognition of them, thou mayst find thyself in the most exalted height while finding another among them who hath not recognized Him. Therefore trust in God that thou be not veiled, for verily glory and knowledge both lie in belief in Him. Through this one becometh exalted, whether he be the highest or lowest of creation. Look then to those whom He hath made Manifestations of Unity in the Bayan, that on that Day thou mayest not be veiled by the loftiness of their names, the elevation of their stations, and the inaccessibility of their recognition when they come. For all this returneth to the word of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for were it not that the Point of the Bayan had spoken concerning a thing, how couldst thou have judged it thus? Therefore on that Day be not veiled from the Manifestations of Unity and from those who resemble those Manifestations unto infinity, for all this standeth by a single command, if thou be of those who are endowed with insight.The Fourth Gate: Concerning the mention of His essential ipseity, which is His abstract body, whereby He receiveth from God life after death through forms of wisdom inaccessible and conditions of knowledge sublime.In the Name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Wondrous. Thou shalt bear witness that He Who is manifest in the Beginning is He Who is manifest in the End, and there is no God but God, He Who created all things, then sustained them, then caused them to die, then brought them back to life. And thou shalt deduce from that letter Mim the unity of worship after \[...\]

Thereby shalt thou be guided by that letter Mim to the unity of worship, after thou hast acknowledged the oneness of God, thy Lord, in His Essence, Attributes and Actions. The latter ever circles round the manifestation of His glory and draws sustenance from the former to the utmost height of His bounty. Verily, at the inception of the Manifestation, if thou wert to comprehend God's revelation unto the Letters of the Living, thou wouldst be guided by the revelation of all else unto infinity by infinity, or until He Whom God shall make manifest from the manifestation of His Self - all drawing sustenance from God through the Point of the Bayan: the Essential Ones in the heights of their hearts, the Beings in the exaltation of their spirits, the Souls in the inaccessibility of their selves, and the Identities in the loftiness of their forms. Just as thou, shouldst thou observe in this moment those who were guided by Muhammad, the Messenger of God, thou seest all circling round that which appeared from Him - the high and the exalted, the near and the nearer - for the First One hath no beginning after His manifestation, or before His manifestation He hath a manifestation whereby the rule of manifestation is cut off in the later Manifestation, and through His shadow are made evident the wondrous manifestations of His glory and the revelations of His might. God hath assigned to the kingdom neither beginning nor end. God ever causeth all to draw sustenance in creation through the Primal Point, Who hath ever been and shall ever be manifest through the manifestation of His Self and hidden through the concealment of His Essence. Verily, His manifestation in every Dispensation, were it not to perfect the manifestation before it, would not appear thereafter, for the example of each of His manifestations is like unto a tree: when God knoweth it will bear fruit, He permitteth it to manifest itself. None hath any being except through Him. Consider the Point of the Furqan (Quran), then witness before it its like. Dost thou find in the religion of the Point of the Furqan anything before its manifestation? And if there be anything, that is from His manifestation in the Point of the Gospel. Likewise do beings come into existence through the manifestation of the Primal Point, inasmuch as it is essentially self-subsistent, and all draw sustenance from it through its manifestations. Therefore, on the day of its manifestation, none can draw sustenance from it except through what proceedeth from it. For example, when thou hast learned the knowledge of the Bayan, thou hast learned it from its divines, and these from its sources, until it terminateth at its Source. Blessed is he who apprehendeth the Source of the Cause, for therein lieth glory. Consider thyself before the manifestation of the Bayan: thou didst follow in the Quran one of the divines due to his knowledge which appeared from the Gates of Guidance. Then observe them, for they follow none save through the word of one of the Imams, and these follow none save through the word of Muhammad, and He followeth none save through the Word of God. For were He to follow His own word for forty years, how would His exaltation not have appeared in the Kingdom on high even unto the first atom? All this is from God, for He alone is independently followed, none else. All manifestations are for the exaltation of His manifestation, and all conditions for the inaccessibility of His conditions. Even so was the Point of the Bayan, before God revealed unto Him His Word, as one among those who worshipped God according to what was ordained from Him in the True Faith. Likewise shall ye be on the Day of the Manifestation of Truth, the Day of Resurrection. Therefore apprehend ye the Source of the Cause.

And verily, in like manner, before God had sent down His Word upon the Point of the Bayan, how could anyone who worshipped God according to what He had ordained in the true Faith be considered? Thus shall ye be on the Day of the Manifestation of Truth, the Day of Resurrection. Therefore ye shall understand the beginning of the Cause and shall not be veiled from its exalted, lofty, impregnable and transcendent manifestations in the Bayan. Verily, all this is established by the Word of God, and the repository of that Word is He Whom God shall make manifest, even as the Point of the Bayan was the repository of all those manifestations, and before that the Point of the Furqan (Quran), and before that the Point of the Gospel. If thou gazest unto infinity, thou shalt behold the Manifestation of thy Lord, and if thou gazest unto infinity beyond, thou shalt behold the Manifestation of God. And if thou considerest the Most Great Name, verily beneath it are two names mentioned - say: that is due to the exaltation of that Word. That which describeth God describeth not His creation, and from God this is what the Most Exalted Name \[signifieth\]. And if the two names had power before God named anything, then that Name is associated therewith. And verily this is evident, for after God hath named all things by His names, then all shall be named. And the fruit of this is that on the Day of Resurrection, He Whom God shall make manifest shall name thee among the unitarians. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I am among those who magnify Thee! Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I am among those who bow down before Thee!The Third Gate of the Third Unity concerning the Green Emerald Pillar:In the Name of God, the First. Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto the Primal Divine Point, the Rising Sun of Reality and the Divine, Impregnable Countenance in its essence, and hath cast therein what was concealed in His mystery, and hath manifested from His presence what beseemeth it at its appearance. Then He made it an impregnable Word, an exalted Jewel, a veiled Countenance, an eternal Archetype, and an everlasting Camphor. Its beginning indicateth its end, and its outward its inward, wherein naught is seen save God, its Lord, and it speaketh naught save of God, its Revealer. Then through that Point He revealed Himself in the primary manifestations, and through it unto all things, whereby were renewed the essential realities of hearts as thrones of His glorification, the essential realities of spirits as thrones of His praise, the essential realities of souls as thrones of His unity, and the essential realities of bodies as thrones of His magnification - thus demonstrating His power over all contingent beings, perfecting the manifestation of His grace upon all created things, completing the bestowals of His primordial novelty upon all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and conferring from the treasuries of His primordial self-subsistence upon all atoms. For He is exalted above being known by any contingent being, or being praised by any created thing, or having any essence ascend to the heaven of His holy transcendence, or any deprived one gazing into the atmosphere of the heaven of His bounty and glory. He is the Ever-Existing One Who hath been and will forever be, without geometry or transition, the Transcendent One in the eternity of eternities and the summit of majesty, above all geometry and decline. Then He created that creation from nothing through His power and revealed Himself unto it through itself, not through aught else besides its own essence.

It manifested to itself through itself, not through anything other than its own essence. He made the example of the sun of His manifestation like the sun of heaven in its ascendancy. Then what is manifested in the origin of His bounty and illumined from the treasure-house of His might is like gleaming mirrors wherein nothing is seen except what the celestial sun has revealed therein. For verily it is what it is in its own realm, not what it is in the exaltation of the sun nor what it is in the lowliness of the mirror. Rather it is what it is within the bounds of its existence and it is what it is at the zenith of its manifestation. Nothing is seen therein except from it, as though it were itself in the mirror while what is in the mirror is itself in the heights of attributes. Thus did God create what shines forth through the appearance of the Sun of the Point of the Furqan when it shone forth through the appearance of the Sun of the Point of the Bayan. When all mirrors had been polished through the crafts of knowledge and deeds at the ultimate peak of the darkest night in the year one thousand two hundred and seventy, God then permitted the sun of His manifestation to shine forth in the day and to remove the veil of His concealment after His appearance from the countenance of His hiddenness. Then He proclaimed with the most exalted mention that "There is no God but I, Who hath manifested through My appearance in the mirrors of your hearts, spirits, souls and bodies." The first to face that Sun was the mirror of the letter Sin (or Shin), then those nearer and nearer until the essences of the First Unity were completed. Then all who faced it were manifested through it by the appearance of its sun, and those who were not manifested through its manifestation were among those who were not mirrors but rather had lost their souls and deprived them of their mirror-like quality in the presence of their Lord's manifestation, though they were created for naught else. Thus did God manifest Himself to the mirrors of the Bayan through the Primal Sun, the Divine Point, that the kingdom of mirrors might be purified between the two manifestations to the highest degree possible in summer, that the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest might be impressed therein and nothing be seen therein except Him, since all were created for that, then were sustained through this, then were caused to die and live for that. Therefore I bear witness before God on this Friday, and so doth everything, that there is no God but He - a testimony that speaketh from the mystery of essence and guideth unto God its Lord from the ultimate height of primacy - and that the Seven Letters, whose servitude God hath joined with the divinity of His Essence, since through them appeareth what God hath willed in creation and is established what God hath desired in invention. For were He not to appear, how would the essences of unity and the realities of the manifestation of servitude be defined in the heights of uniqueness? Through Him hath God filled all the earth with His justice and equity and removed from all things their remoteness and their veils. Then were the heavens and earth and all between them illumined by His light, and the pillars of all things from the most exalted heights to the primary heavens were filled with the sublimity of His Self-Subsistence and His manifestation. Bear witness that He is the servant of God and the Gate to His knowledge. God hath chosen Him from the zenith of the midst of creation for Himself and selected Him from the heights of the essence of invention for His Own Self. Bear witness that He is His servant and His Word. God hath purified Him from similitudes \[...\]

God hath cleansed His Word from similitudes and likenesses, as a manifestation of the loftiness of His Being and in token of the exaltation of His signs. Then did God choose for the Manifestation of His Self from the letters -- from before -- wherein He clothed them in the garment of His knowledge before all creation, distinguished them through faith in Him before all His servants, and made them pillars of the manifestations, repositories of the depths of His sanctification, dawning-places of the appearance of His unity, and mines of the holiness of His glorification. Then did God choose from His creation that which is befitting to shine forth at the radiance of His effulgence, or that naught should be seen in aught save the appearance of His revelation through His creation, until the period reached -- the number -- the First Unity for the manifestation of the Oneness presaged by the First Unity in the essences of the divine realm from among the glorifying angels, and the realities of the realm of might from among the sanctified angels, and the spiritual realms of the kingdom from among the unifying angels, and the entities of the realm of ruby from among the magnifying angels. Thus were the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him, Creator of all things and their Sustainer, Who causeth all things to die and giveth them life. There is none other God but Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them glorify Him, and verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved.The Fourth Gate concerning the Fourth Letter pertaining to the Pillar of the Red Ruby. In the Name of God, the First, the First. Thou shalt assuredly witness in the letter Ha the manifestation of the three letters, for when it was brought into being, naught appeared at the height of its manifestation save through that letter. Yet God, glorified be He, transcendeth these letters. Rather, He created them and revealed Himself to them through them in such wise that naught was seen in them save Him. And verily My saying that God created those letters refers to letters in creation -- God is the Creator of all things -- naught was seen in those letters save God, that one might mention an aspect of creation. Exalted be God, then exalted be God, then exalted be God, then exalted be God, above having mentioned in relation to God and His names the letters of creation, for creation hath ever been clothed in the garments of limitations, while God, exalted and glorified be He, and all His names and likenesses are sanctified above mention of limitations and examples of letters. And thou shalt assuredly witness that all knowledge in its highest abstraction, essence, camphor-like nature and pristine state hath originated from the Manifestation of the Point, for shouldst thou expound a letter in a thousand thousand verses, this would be but what originated from Him and indicated God, His Lord, through what hath shone forth from His presence. Thus thou, in the spirits of these words, shalt assuredly find proof through their expressions, though God, glorified be He, is exalted above being described by anything, or mentioned, or characterized by anything, or depicted. And if thou comprehendest that letter before the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then thou hast comprehended the Night of Power which is better than the first pearls of that Manifestation until that time. For if in that Manifestation thou comprehendest that letter, it shall surely prepare thee for that Manifestation, though He Who appeareth therein is none other than the manifestation of that Point in the Manifestation before it, for the ultimate height and loftiest summit thereof is what their Imams intended. Thus do We teach thee in every time the essence of knowledge and the pure abstraction of wisdom, for thou regardest knowledge even as thou regardest the known -- thy knowledge of stone being the ultimate measure of its worth \[...\]

Pure wisdom lies in the fact that you look upon knowledge just as you look upon the object of knowledge - your knowledge of a stone defines its worth, and your knowledge of a ruby defines its splendor. I have given you this example of something finite so that you may comprehend the manifestations of the Divine Essence and the conditions of eternity. Direct your knowledge toward Him Whom God shall make manifest, for therein lie oceans of knowledge. Unless you recognize that He is the Most Exalted Name and the Best of Names - whether He names you among the most high or otherwise - for verily He names each thing according to what lies within it. And if you and all creation consider yourself learned, yet He names you otherwise, let not this veil you from what God your Lord has named you through the tongue of the Manifestation of His Self. For if you were to encompass His knowledge without acceptance, you would not acknowledge that He is the Best of Names. This indeed is a mighty path upon which all must pass. Those who accept what God names them on the Day of Resurrection - these are they who are guided, if they are of those who are certain of God and His signs.I shall remove the veil from your eyes, for verily you shall utter these words from the Point of the Bayan until the end of His manifestation - nay, every soul speaks them. But all this reveals its fruits, or you shall not utter a word of negation until God names you on the Day of Resurrection. For verily He shall make negation affirmation, and affirmation negation, and He shall reveal those words; then you shall see what lies within them. For on that Day, if you believe not in God's signs, you shall be tested. But bear witness that whom He Whom God shall make manifest names - that is what God has named, and it cannot be changed.Look at the monks in the time of Muhammad - He named them through the tongue of His Lord as servants among God's monks, though they were considered by themselves and by the people as pious servants. Thus observe what God named them - it was established despite what they named themselves. Be not veiled from this in the Point of the Bayan, nor in Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor unto infinity. For God's word is not like the word of any created thing, and there is no altering it from God, though all are named thereby. And if one assigns a name to something other than what God has named it, then one has become veiled from God in that matter, unless it be from the conditions of that Name \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth, and verily unto God do all return. Glorified be He Whom all in the heavens and all on earth do praise, and verily unto God do all turn. Glorified be He before Whom all in the heavens and all on earth stand in devotion, and verily unto God do all return. Glorified be He before Whom bow down in submission all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth and whatsoever is between them, and verily unto God do all turn. Glorified be He before Whom all within the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever is between them show humility, and verily unto God shall all be raised up. He is the One Who createth all things by His command, and verily unto Him do all turn. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and verily unto Him do all turn. Say: God is the Provider of all things, and verily unto Him shall all be raised up. Say: God causeth you to die, then giveth you life, then will He raise you up on a Day about which there is no doubt. On that Day ye shall be lying in your dwelling places. And when God announceth unto you a sign from His presence, ye fail to remember, even as He hath announced unto you all the signs from the Book of God, yet ye do not remember. Ye shall surely bear witness that unto God belong all names, both in the past and in the future. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. God hath not created any name that pointeth unto Him like unto that Name, wherefore all are submissive before Him. Say: Just as ye behold naught in those letters except God, likewise ye behold in Him Whom God shall make manifest and His evidences naught except God and His names. Thus doth God set forth His verses that ye may remember. How then can God say unto you that ye draw proofs from these letters, while ye draw no proofs from the Manifestations of these letters, nor are ye certain of God, your Lord? Say: God desireth to guide all who are on earth - and verily that particle of clay in the depths of the sea \[...\] God desireth to guide that soul so that particle may enter Paradise. This is God's grace unto all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them, and then unto all things. Why then do ye veil yourselves from God's grace? If ye believe in God and His signs, then ye shall be guided unto your own selves. And if ye veil yourselves from God, your Lord, then ye shall remain veiled in your own fire. Do ye know what is most severe when ye veil yourselves from God, your Lord? Say: Glory be to God! After this ye shall comprehend that fire. And if ye veil not yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest, how can ye recognize any besides Him or be drawn to him, thus entering the fire without knowing? Glory be unto Thee, O God! On that Day send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest with sovereignty and dominion, then bless Him and those whom Thou shalt raise up with might and power, then upon Him Whom Thou shalt manifest with strength and divinity, then upon Him Whom Thou shalt exalt with force and glory, then upon Him through Whom Thou shalt overcome all things by Thy power with dominion and the realm of existence, for Thou art the God and Lord of all things. There is no God but Thee, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. The Second Gate concerning the Second Letter of the Yellow Pillar of 'Perhaps'. In the Name of God, the Divine, the Divine. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness \[...\]

By the Lord of all things! There is no God but Thee, the Sovereign, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. The Second Gate concerning the Second Letter of the Yellow Corner 'La'all'.In the Name of God, the God of gods! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and sovereignty, Thine the celestial and terrestrial realms, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the might and grandeur, Thine the strength and action, Thine the likeness and similitudes, Thine the mercy and grace, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the inaccessibility and independence, Thine the dominion and sublimity, Thine the might and invincibility, Thine the loftiness and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the tribulation and detachment, Thine is whatsoever is seen and unseen from the highest heaven to the primal atom.I bear witness with certainty that Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, and wilt ever be, existing after all things. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Individual, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Protecting, Most Holy. Thou wert God when there was none to be deified, and Lord when there was none to be lorded over. After all deified beings became servants unto Thy Being, and all lorded over prostrated themselves before Thy Self. Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then cause to die and to live. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Individual Who faileth not.O God! Cause to be present around the First the Letters of the Living, then in the Second the Letters of the Kingdom, then in the Third the Letters of Justice, then in the Fourth the Letters of Sovereignty, then in the Fifth the Letters of Unity. And cause all these to be present at the first hour, for this is most delightful to my heart when I behold the veils of Thy servants; otherwise Thy Command is nearer than all things.Then cause, O God, the letters of all names and similitudes to be present before Thee on the Day of Thy Manifestation, for all begin from Thee and all return unto Thee. O God! Gather together all the means of glory, conditions of grandeur, gifts of holiness, and whatsoever befitteth the sublimity of Thy generosity and is worthy at the revelation of Thy Lordship and majesty for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest at the return of the Bayan and all who are therein unto Him, each according to their ranks in Thy kingdom, and create whatsoever Thou lovest to be manifested through Him, for all are within their limits. For that is the time of the end of the Cause, than which there existeth in Thy knowledge nothing greater.I beseech Thee to manifest Him with supreme independence and power, and ultimate sublimity and strength, that He may not be saddened by anyone. Verily, in the manifestation of the Point of the Furqan and then the Bayan, Thou didst not manifest, O my God, the like thereof. Therefore, O God, gather for Him all these means that He may not be saddened throughout His life, neither in His concealment nor in His manifestation, by anything, for all rejoice through Him. How then wouldst Thou not cause such conditions to flow for Him when all are saddened in Thy path through Him? Therefore, O God, protect Him and all who believe in Him from whatsoever saddeneth Him, for Thou hast not created anything except for Him, neither in the Bayan nor before it, for remoteness hath not appeared except from His presence. Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Glory be unto Thee! Verily, I am of those who glorify Thee.

Glorified be Thou! There is no God but Thee! Glorified be Thou! I have ever been of them that glorify. Glorified be Thou! There is no God but Thee! Glorified be Thou! I have ever been of them that praise. Glorified be Thou! There is no God but Thee! Glorified be Thou! I have ever been of them that testify to Thy unity.O Thou Who art the Most Unique of the unique ones! Knowledge and wisdom flow forth, as all knowledge in its essence derives from the manifestation of its revelation from His Essence. By His essence, He is the repository of knowledge and wisdom, and the source of glory and grandeur. With Him is naught but the essence of essences of knowledge and wisdom, and the pure abstraction, for at this time all the knowledge and wisdom found in the religion of Islam returns to the word of Muhammad, which in turn returns to the Book of God, as therein lies the source of all these things. Likewise, at the end of the exaltation of the Bayan, all that thou findest of knowledge and wisdom was revealed from the Primal Point, and all of this constitutes the capacities of essences, that ye may learn from the repository of knowledge at the time of its manifestation, and from the source of wisdom at the time of its dawning. Look not upon all people with the same eye, for the likeness of all forms compared to the form of Him Whom God shall make manifest is as the likeness of suns in mirrors compared to the sun in heaven - all derive their existence from it and draw their sustenance from it, and have no reality except through it. If those who are in the Bayan had any reality, how is it that before His manifestation they do not show it? Rather, this is because they have no reality except through Him. And similarly in the Qur'an, after the cessation of revelation until the year 1270 after the Mission, had anyone possessed any reality, they would have necessarily manifested it. How is it then that all followed what God revealed to Muhammad? This is because their realities were brought into being through Him, and all besides the Sun of Truth derive their reality from His reality, while His reality is from God in itself. And similarly, from the manifestation of Ali to Muhammad, the glorious Manifestation of the Divine Will was not able to reveal from God a book containing the details of all things, for all things were held in His grasp, just as thou seest all who are in the Bayan, for what they possess and what is incumbent upon them appeared from none other than His Point. And God did not manifest before the Point of the Bayan His Primal Will in a manifestation that would speak openly from God or manifest from His presence the aspects of glorification, praise, unity, and magnification. Rather, that is what God specifically bestowed upon the Point of the Bayan, and the matter pertains to the verses of God, for without attention they recite God where nothing can equal it, as this is from the essence of the heart. However, concerning that which relates to the spirit, the soul, and the essential substance, one must needs pay attention to the forms of knowledge, that the words may be revealed according to their proper limits and the repositories of their hidden and manifest realities. Dispute not with Him Whom God shall make manifest concerning such matters, for verily God is each day engaged in a fresh operation, and God's operation is to manifest man in the manifestation of His Self, and verily in what He manifests He shall be at the summit of perfection and the height of majesty.

The sublimity of glory, the exaltation of beauty, the transcendence of deeds, and the supremacy of self-subsistence and independence - who can describe Him by that which is attributed to Him? For every description is described through the manifestation of itself, and every attribute is attributed through the manifestation of its own nature. This is the mirror wherein none shall see God except God, before and after. There is no God but He, the King, the Most High.There is no doubt that perfection is manifest in itself to those who understand, and knowledge and wisdom are manifest to those who conceal or exalt. Therefore, pride not thyself in exposition through licenses, but veil thyself from them through verses and words from God, exalted be His glory, for this is what God loveth not. Fear ye God, O people of wisdom, that ye may prosper before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.The Third Chapter of the First Vahid of the Third Day of the Year concerning the knowledge of God's Name, the One, which hath four stations. The first is the unity of the Essence, wherein God reveals Himself to that Letter. In the name of God, the Most One, the Most One. Say: God is more singular than every possessor of oneness. None in the heavens or on the earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of His unity's sovereignty. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Unifying, the One, the Single.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth, and we are all prostrators unto Him. Glorified be He Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them praise, and we are all devoutly obedient unto Him. Glorified be He unto Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them are devoted. Say: All shall return unto Him.He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and unto God shall all be turned. He it is Who createth what He willeth by His command "Be" and it is. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day. Say: All shall return unto God. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto God shall all return. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them by His command. He aideth whom He willeth by His leave. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: He is the Knower of every soul. He knoweth what it hath earned and witnesseth what it earneth. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. He is manifest above His creation, and verily He is the Single, the Vivifying, the Most High, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.O Letter Vav! Bear thou witness that there is no God but He, the One, the All-Unifying, and recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest in truth, for all proofs are His, before and after. Thus doth God counsel you that ye may glory in the meeting with your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.Bear witness that the One by which God is mentioned, verily He cannot be mentioned by any besides Him. Glorified and exalted is He above what all mention. That One cannot be comprehended by any besides Him, nor can He be expressed by number, nor hath He any letters except His own Self. Glorified and exalted is He above what all describe, save those who describe God according to what hath been revealed in the Book. These are they who possess knowledge. These are they who describe God as He Whom God shall make manifest describeth Him, from what God hath taught him. Verily, He is the Truth, the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Most High, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.

Exalted is He above all that they describe, save those who describe God according to what has been revealed in the Book, for these are they who know - those who describe God as He Whom God shall make manifest shall describe Him, which God Himself has taught Him. He is verily the Truth, the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.And verily, the number that is mentioned in creation concerning the Unity reaches unto that Name, until it is mentioned among those stones as the number of Unity or without number. When ye make mention of the names of God, make not mention of them as ye mention them in creation according to their stations. And all that the First Unity has mentioned concerning creation points only to God their Lord, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Beloved.And verily that Unity can be known by none save Him. And if ye recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, then ye shall all find yourselves as the First Unity, without number, in the exaltation of the Cause. God hath appointed no path for anyone except unto Him. Say: From Him do all receive their change. Say: All through His command unto Him shall return. Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily, the similitude of the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest is like unto the manifestation of the Point of the Qur'an before you, that ye may comprehend. Like unto the Point of the Bayan, were all who are on earth to believe in Him at the time when God raised up Muhammad, or after one thousand two hundred and seventy years had passed and they had shown their faith in numbers which none can reckon save God their Lord, there would still be but one Command. And were all who are on earth to testify to the truth of the First Unity in the Bayan, like unto the Letters of the Living, then all would rejoice in the paradise of their Lord.Likewise, if ye show not patience in your faith in God your Lord, then ye shall not be veiled from the measure of separation in the fire. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! Were all who are on earth to gather together in His love and then believe in Him, God would not create any fire. Fire is created only when one loveth Him not after having loved Him in His previous Manifestation, and when one is veiled from His love in His subsequent Manifestation. Thus shall ye all be questioned.The command of God is none other than that God should manifest His proof and send down His verses unto Him. Then it behooveth you to believe in God and His verses, and then to act according to God's command. Say: His likeness is as the sun - if a number of mirrors face it, His manifestation is seen therein, and if a thousand thousand ones face it, likewise, and above that likewise, and below that likewise, then unto what cannot be numbered, likewise. Thus doth God set forth similitudes that ye may show mercy unto your own selves.Say: All names belong unto God, all do call upon them, but at every Manifestation ye recognize not the realities of the names except through the Temples that are made manifest through the verses of God from the Manifestor of His Self. Thus doth God teach you all knowledge that ye may fear Him.

But at each Revelation, ye shall not recognize the Essences of the Names save through the Temples that are made manifest with the signs of God from the Manifestation of His Self. Thus doth God teach you all knowledge that ye may perchance fear Him. Verily all the Names of the Gospel, on the day of the Prophet's Revelation, returned unto Ali, as he believed in Him, and there was no Imam with Him save him. Thus on that day was he all the Prophets, and all the Successors were he. Thus do ye in every Revelation draw your proofs. And whatsoever multiplieth according to the number of the Manifestations of the Cause from among the temples of creation - thus doth God acquaint you with the knowledge of the Book that ye may perchance fear Him.The Second Gate: Concerning the Letter Alif, on the Unity of AttributesIn the Name of God, the Most Unique, the Most Unique!In the Name of God, the Most Unique, the Most Unique!Glorified art Thou, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divine Essence, Thine the Strength and the Ruby, Thine the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. Thou givest life and death, then death and life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things, and a dominion that passeth not away, and a sovereignty that changeth not, and an Individual Who escapeth not, and a Justice that wrongeth not. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thyself, for there is naught beside Thee that can equal Thee, nor resemble Thee, nor be Thy peer, nor be Thy companion, nor be Thy likeness, and then by all Thy names and examples, for each one in its loftiest height and most sublime elevation from the manifestation of Thy revelation, Thou hast clothed it in the garment of Thy grandeur and arrayed it in the mantle of Thy greatness, and naught is seen in all Thy names except Thee, for Thou art the One not by number, and the Single that cannot be described by any, and the Eternal Support Who hath exalted Thyself in Thine Essence above all contingent things, and the Single Support Who hath distinguished Thyself in Thine Identity above all identities. Creation is Thy creation and the Command is from Thee and unto Thee, alone with no God but Thee.I beseech Thee by Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, for verily He is the Manifestation of Thy Self, and then by him who indicateth Him, for verily his heart is the Name which resteth in Thy shadow and goeth not forth from Thee unto Thy might. And Thou shalt surely teach, O God, every soul in its beginning and its end, by showing it the repository of Thy Command in what Thou hast willed for it and for others, for verily Thou dost make manifest all things through their causes, though some things are cut off from their causes by creation. For example, what Thou hast created of the heavens and the earth, the sun and the moon and the stars, the seas and the mountains, and what Thou hast created in them of the wonders of Thy creative work and the subtleties of Thy novel craftsmanship - for all these things, those souls perceive not their causes from themselves, even though all that hath been created by Thy command and brought into being by Thy creation, and for each one within its limit where none hath encompassed its knowledge save it. But what Thou hast ordained in that creation from the manifestation of that, Thou hast made the measures of its appearance by Thy power from themselves, or from whoso desireth to help Thy friend by himself - the repository of help should he seek to help. And like unto this are all conditions that appear from creation, or from whoso desireth for himself from among the posterity - Thou hast made for him measures in creation that appear not except through them \[...\]

And likewise are all the attributes that appear from creation, or from one who desires for himself progeny, for which measures have been ordained in creation that appear only through them. And likewise is the creation of all things, and their sustenance, and the death of all things, and their life, for all things appear through what the Manifestation of thy Self uttereth on the Day of Resurrection, or through what is uttered similarly until another Resurrection. These are the attributes of Thy grace, for with Thee are permission and exposition. And if Thou shouldst deny anyone Thy permission, how could he possess what he desireth from the treasuries of Thy Cause and creation? Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. All knowledge belongeth to him who knoweth Thee, even if he knoweth naught else, and all are bereft of knowledge who know Thee not, even if they know all things. This is Thy grace unto them that are nigh. And I testify that the knowledge of Thee appeareth only through the knowledge of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, for the attributes of creation in His knowledge follow the paths of Thy revelation. All are in the chambers of Thy paradise and the mysteries of Thy good-pleasure when they are for Him and not against Him, or whom He hath \[addressed\] through the Bayan - he is in Thy paradise, and verily the degrees of that paradise none can reckon save Thee. All, according to their stations and the loftiness of their understanding, delight in Thy remembrance and praise, and ask of Thy purpose and glory, and seek evidence of the exaltation of Thy majesty in the sanctuary of Thy bounty and Thy sublimity. Therefore Thou hast not desired that anyone should reject another except when he is veiled by something from Thy commandments, for then he is rejected by his companions but not from his religion, for religion remaineth firm for him when he believeth in Thee and then in Him Whom Thou hast made manifest with clear proofs, and followeth what Thou hast revealed in the Bayan, which none save Thee can comprehend. It is as though I behold with mine own eyes before Thee the degrees of the paradises of them that are in the Bayan at this time until the Day of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest - all are extinguished in their places and turned back from the heights of Thy grace to their dwellings of glory until Thou bestowest favor upon all things through the manifestation of Thyself and desirest to renew the creation of all things through the appearance of Thine innovation. For then whoso believeth in Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and followeth His verses - these are the companions of paradise and these shall abide forever in the paradise of Thy good-pleasure, whether they be the highest or lowest fruits of the Bayan. Therefore, O my God, bestow favor upon the earth and all that are thereon by causing them to enter, in that Manifestation, into Thy good-pleasure through making them know Thyself by what Thou hast sent down of Thy verses unto Him, that all who are on earth may follow one religion - that of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest - lest there remain on that Day anyone on earth who knoweth not his Lord or believeth not in His verses, and that all may be assured of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and His words. And even if on the day of His manifestation there be but one believer, that one would be the essence of all things, through whom Thou wouldst purify what Thou willest and multiply the guides to the sun of Thy love through the manifestations of what appeareth in creation. Verily, Thou art the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Exalted.The Third Gate. The Letter Ha. Concerning the Unity of Deeds.In the Name of God, the Most Unique, the Most Unique. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity. Know thou that this Letter is a divine Letter \[...\]

And whoso resembleth that One, wherein naught can be seen save the Primal One, know thou that such a Letter is a divine Letter, a celestial Name, an eternal Temple, and an infinite Symbol, betokening the unity of all deeds, that there is no God but God, Who is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, Who causeth all to die and all to live. His is the creation and the command, both before and after, and unto Him do all return. I testify that if thou doest naught save what the Point of the Bayan hath done and commanded, which is the very Deed of God in the realm of creation and the plane of invention, then verily hast thou attained unto that unity. I shall make known unto thee all the degrees of unity, for heretofore thou hast known naught but words devoid of reality. The Eternal Essence, exalted and glorified be He, hath ever unified, and will forever continue to unify, His Essence through His Essence, His attributes through His attributes, and His deeds through His deeds, and praiseth His own Self with that which befitteth His eternal exaltation and His primordial supremacy. No one among creation hath any way to comprehend aught of this, for therein the First is above the Last, and the Manifest above the Hidden. But if thou desirest, within the bounds of creation, to be illumined by the dawning-places of these Manifestations and to be enlightened by the radiance of these Daysprings, then look thou unto the Primal One. For in the manifestations of the abolition, if they be not conjoined with His manifestations, thou hast indeed comprehended the unity of the First. Then in the second, likewise, is the unity of attributes; then in the third, likewise; then in the fourth, likewise. But all this returneth unto that which hath appeared from the First Letter, or that which uniteth the Second Letter in the unity of the Essence - this is from the manifestation of His Essence; and that which uniteth the manifestations of praise - this is from the revelations of His attributes; and that which uniteth the manifestations of unity - this is from the revelations of His deeds; and that which uniteth from the manifestations of worship - this is from the revelations of His exaltation. And likewise from the similitude of these Manifestations. Look thou unto the appearance of the Bayan, for all that proceedeth from it and returneth unto it of the highest knowledge, or that endeth at the uttermost degrees, hath begun from it likewise. Thus bear thou witness in the appearance of the Point of the Furqan, then unto that which hath no end before it, then unto that which hath no end after the Point of the Bayan. For this is the mystery of all that is from God or from the Essence of God, which appeareth only through an Essence wherein naught can be seen save the Essence of God, which God hath related unto Himself, such that it indicateth naught but Him. Thus when thou mentionest God and His names, thou hast reached the ultimate of what God desireth for thee. And when thou art a manifestation of creation, or sustenance, or death, or life through thy love for Him Whom God shall make manifest, then art thou among the mirrors of that unity; else thou dwellest in the shadows of the fire. And whosoever hath acted after the appearance of Muhammad with His good-pleasure, verily he is the manifestation of His deed according to his existence and station, in the measure that he hath accepted His revelation. For were he not of the deed of the Manifestation of His deed, how could he be a unifier of God or one who guideth unto Him until the appearance of the Point of the Bayan?

Observe the order according to His manifestation, for if it were not from the action of the Manifestation of His action, how could one be a believer in the oneness of God or be guided to Him until the appearance of the Point of the Bayan? But the first manifestation of His action is that action, not the action that appeared before. If one acts according to the action of His previous manifestation, he has not recognized the unity of God in the station of deeds. However, if one acts in accordance with what God has manifested through the Point of the Bayan, then he has indeed recognized the unity of God through what has been revealed to him in the similarity of the action of the mirrors of His Self. All claim the stations of such unity, but when the realities appear, they remain veiled. Look upon the letters of the Name of the One as you would look upon the clay of the Kaaba. Remember in the first third the name of the Manifestation of the Essence, then in the fourth the name of the Manifestation of Attributes, then in the fifth the Manifestation of the name of Deeds, then in the sixth the Manifestation of the name of Worship. Similarly, observe the multiplication of these manifestations as you observe Him. Then look in the Quran how many recognize the unity of God in the Essence. Had they truly recognized Muhammad, Ali and Fatima before - who were the letters of those manifestations - they would not have been veiled. Then in the station of the manifestations of attributes, after those three names are four, then after that in the manifestations of deeds after that are six, then in the fourth manifestations after that are six. Had they been truthful therein, they would not have been veiled in that manifestation. All this is so that on the Day when God manifests the Manifestation of His Self through the One by which you in the Bayan seek proof, you may not be veiled. For on that Day, that One will be Him Whom God shall make manifest and the Letters of the Living. I mention the Letters of the Living because I see you have become attached to the Letters of the Living in the Bayan. Otherwise, were all the letters of His Cause to appear before Him, whether they be countless or countable, it would be the same. For example, in the manifestation of the Bayan, when the Point of Truth found that you had become attached to names, therefore I informed you of their return, or their manifestation, or their resurrection, or other such terms that you might comprehend. Otherwise, the Cause in the sight of God is not as you imagine. You must recognize every manifestation like the manifestation of Muhammad - did He have any Letters of the Living except Ali? Though the successors of Ali are exalted upon their thrones, rejoicing with their Lord. All this is so that you may not be veiled on the Day of His manifestation by this or that, but that you may look to the mystery of Truth. If you find therein the proof from God through clear verses that have rendered all the world powerless, and manifest words that have confounded all the discerning ones, then verily He is the Sun of Truth, His Divine Essence, His Lordly Reality, His Unitary Self, and His Eternal Identity. He creates through His word whatsoever He willeth of the primary Letters of the Living, and let not these names veil you. Look to the source of the Letters of the Living in the Bayan - were they anything without the word of the Point? Had He not spoken of their mention, would you have known them? And similarly on that Day, let it not veil you, for all names belong to Him from before.

Verily on such a day naught shall veil you, for unto Him belong all names, both before and after. Should all upon earth believe in Him, their essences would be but a name before their Lord, and their temples would be but manifestations of the outward through outward appearance and of the inward through inward reality. And were there but one, that would be all things, even as appeared in Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Likewise, God shall cause the essences of the Bayan to ascend in such wise that there shall appear before Him the Letters of the Living, then the Kingdom, then Justice, then Sovereignty, then Unity, when God so willeth - verily He hath power over all things. Then all names and similitudes shall be according to how God hath revealed Himself unto them through them. Let not a single station or place veil you, for from the first to the last Day of Resurrection, all who appear before Him, recognize Him, and believe in Him are among the guides of His Cause and the names of His glory, whether they be of the first or the last. But the nearest are the nearest: whoso recognizeth Him at the beginning of His manifestation is exalted above whoso recognizeth Him at its end. This is that ye may all recognize Him at the beginning of His manifestation. Your glory lieth in this, for were ye not to recognize Him, ye would not enter into faith. Yet verily He is independent of you and of all that ye comprehend. If no mirror were to face the sun, would aught be diminished from its radiance? Glorified be God above this! Similarly with you at His manifestation - were all upon earth to face the Sun of His manifestation, all would enter into faith; yet if only those whom God hath ordained face it, that is His grace, and the mirror of His manifestation is reflected therein. On that day the essence of all creation shall be those manifestations. This is what God, your Lord, hath enjoined upon you, that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection.The Fourth Gate concerning the letter Dal, regarding the Unity of Worship.In the Name of God, the Most Unique, the Most Unique.Praise be to God Who created the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them by His command, then revealed Himself unto all things through what He hath deposited in the likeness of His creation. He is the First before all things, yet cannot be known through firstness; He is the Last after all things, yet cannot be described through lastness; He is the Outward above all things, yet cannot be characterized through outwardness; He is the Inward beneath all things, yet cannot be comprehended through inwardness. He is the One, not from number nor likeness, and He is the Single, not from similitude nor semblance. The essential reality of the sovereignty of His Self-Subsistence hath been sanctified from the ascent to the atmosphere of His eternal might of the highest birds of the sanctified realm of glory, and the hidden essence of the camphorated, pristine reality of the King of glorious unity hath been sanctified and exalted above the ascent unto Him of the highest subtleties of the realm of contingent beings. He is as He hath ever been and as He shall ever be. Neither geometry nor conditions alter Him, neither similitudes nor indications change Him. He is the Dominant, the Manifest, the Excellent, the Resplendent above all things. He hath ever been through the reality of His holiness and shall ever be through the essence of His Self-Subsistence. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him; we all worship Him alone. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Soul and the Divine Temple and the Eternal Mystery \[...\]

The divine mystery, the lordly countenance, and the face of oneness, which hath planted the trees of unity in the realities of all beings through the manifestation of what was revealed unto them by itself, casting therein the likeness of its own essence. Thus everything that hath been brought into being through His creative act from His manifestation, or any essence that might exist - how could it not manifest Him before its own manifestation? This is the unique mystery in the proof of creation and the exalted one in the summit of invention. It glorifieth God, its Lord, as He hath described Himself, and praiseth its Creator through what He hath revealed unto it through His attributes, and professeth the unity of its Beloved through what He hath ordained for it from His presence, and worshippeth its Object of Desire through what hath shone forth upon it from the radiance of His bounty.Indeed creation hath gazed upon that through the eye of its Lord and witnessed the creation of all things through His exalted might. Then He chose from among creation servants who were guides of His Cause. Then He ordained measures from His presence and established such paths as God desired for His creation. He fixed the measures according to the heights He had ordained and fashioned the forms according to the loftiness He had designed. Then He established for creation from His presence an enduring proof until the Day of Resurrection, and appointed over it witnesses from among those who deviate not from the measure of a single letter - his testimony - and whoso ascendeth unto God in like manner \[...\] For this is among that which hath its evidence in His creation and a name from the manifestations of His Cause, until God shall return that creation to its Point. Then shall He do whatsoever He willeth, however He willeth, by the leave of His Lord. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted.Then witness in that letter that all letters multiply that Primal Unity. Observe in the Point that therein the letter Nun is the manifestation of transcription, Qaf the manifestation of praise, Ta the manifestation of unity, and Ha the manifestation of magnification. When the symbol in the Point is thus, then by the same token must thou infer regarding all letters and be inspired by them to the essences of the Most Unique of the unique - those letters. For the Primal Unity in the First is one, then in the Second Unity its manifestation unto them is beyond counting and endeth at the End of ends.In that Name the letter Waw is the pillar of transcription, then Alif the pillar of praise, then Ha the pillar of unity, then Dal the pillar of magnification. The conjunction of names with what balanceth and manifesteth their meanings is the measure of the alchemical components in words. Therefore have the alchemical components of all things multiplied and varied according to what appeareth, since in such a name its element of fire must be six measures, then its air one measure, then its water eight measures, then its earth four. Should any one of these be changed, the meaning of unity would not be manifest. Likewise in essential realities, until the matter endeth at the bounds of physical alchemy among its people. If thou knowest the conjunctions and the requirements of each thing according to its measure from those elements, there shall appear what God hath ordained therein of fruit. This is of God's grace and mercy unto whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily, He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth Gate of the First Unity from the Fourth Day of the Year, concerning the knowledge of the Name of Unity.

In the name of God, the One, the One! God, there is no God but Him, the Single, the One! Say: God is more singular than every possessor of singleness. None can withhold himself from the sovereignty of His Singleness, neither in the heavens nor on the earth nor what lies between them. Verily, He is the Most Singular, the One, the Unique.Glorified be He Who created the heavens and the earth and what lies between them by His command, and unto Him do all return. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them, and unto Him are all turned. Glorified be He Who ordereth all things by His command. His is the creation and the command, both before and after. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.God is our Lord and the Lord of our forefathers. God is our Lord and the Lord of our latter mothers. God is our Lord and the Lord of our manifest brothers. God is our Lord and the Lord of our manifest sisters.Say: God originates all things, and unto Him do all return. Say: God creates all things, and by His command do all glorify Him. Say: God provides sustenance to all things, and by His command do all praise Him. Say: God gives life and causes death, and verily He is the Living, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God aids whom He willeth by His command, and unto Him are all transformed. Say: God hath created in the depths of Names concealed pearls which, when ye behold them, draw you unto them. These are the exalted angels who glorify their Lord with praise and are devoted to Him. These are the cherubic angels who glorify their Lord with praise by night and day and are prostrate before Him. These are they who desire naught but God and are humble before their Lord. These are they who glorify their Lord with praise around the Throne and are detached unto God their Lord.God hath created nothing in Paradise like what He hath created in His Paradise of that Name, but ye know it not. Blessed is he \[...\]

And in their innermost hearts, their glances are drawn by those who look upon them by the command of God. Verily, He is the Transcendent, the Self-Subsisting. Say: They are sustained therein with the flesh of birds and with whatsoever they desire of God's bounties. Nay, God hath created therein maidens with eyes like rubies, who glorify their Lord with praise. They bow down before God their Lord and glorify with praise Him Who created them - the Lord of all worlds. Say: He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. All stand there by God's leave. Thus doth God create whatsoever He willeth in that Paradise. And they have angels who serve those therein by their Lord's leave, glorifying their Lord with praise, and they weary not night or day. God hath sent down no name but He hath sent down with it angels from heaven who glorify their Lord with praise for what He hath revealed unto them, testifying that there is no God but Him, the One, the Single. To God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return on the Day of Reckoning. And all that existeth in that Paradise hath been created of crystal - this is of God's grace unto whomsoever He willeth of His servants. Verily, He is the Protector, the Best-Beloved. We give thanks unto God, our Lord, the All-Merciful, therein in numbers and similitudes, and we praise God, our Lord, the Sovereign, therein at eventide and at dawn. We desire naught save God, for in Him have we placed our trust, and in God let all believers place their trust. A sun hath been created therein around which all circle, and in its shadow hath been created whatsoever God desireth for those whom He loveth, as a grace from His presence. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. It glorifieth its Lord with praise and boweth down before God Who created it in that form, fashioned by God's leave. Rejoice ye therein, for We are rejoicing. Await ye the meeting with God, for We are watching. God's is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Second, in the Yellow Light, in the Second Letter. In the Name of God, the One, the One. Glorified be God, the Lord of sovereignty and dominion. Glorified be God, the Lord of might and power. Glorified be God, the Lord of power and divinity. Glorified be God, the Lord of grandeur and rubies. Glorified be God, the Lord of dominion and humanity. Glorified be God, the Lord of glory and majesty. Glorified be God, the Lord of power and beauty. Glorified be God, the Lord of grandeur and independence. Glorified be God, the Lord of purpose and perfection. Glorified be God, the Lord of mercy and grace. Glorified be God, the Lord of authority and justice. Glorified be God, the Lord of metaphor and similitude. Glorified be God, the Lord of geometry and deeds. Glorified be God, the Lord of might and inaccessibility. Glorified be God, the Lord of strength and exaltation. Glorified be God, the Lord of joy and gladness. Glorified be God, the Lord of tribulation and detachment. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the creation and the command, in the past and the future. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single Who escapeth not, the Just Who oppresseth not. Thou createst Thy creation \[...\]

Thine is a justice that oppresseth not. Thy creation and command come from Thee and return unto Thee. There is none other God but Thee. All that dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify Thee, and all that abide in the realms of command and creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them praise Thee. From time immemorial Thou hast existed before all things, and wilt forever remain after all things. Thou hast ever been and ever wilt be above all things, and wilt continue in Thy Being after all things. The dwellers of Thy earth and heaven bow down before Thee, and the Manifestations of Thy Cause and creation turn in complete detachment unto Thee, by reason of Thy transcendent sovereignty. Thou hast ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Abiding, Self-Sufficient, Ever-Enduring, Ever-Dependent. Thou hast taken unto Thyself neither consort nor son. Who is able to make mention of Thee when Thou art exalted above all mention and utterance? Who can praise Thee when Thou art sanctified beyond all praise and description? Glory belongeth unto him who knoweth Thee and followeth the commands of Thy sovereignty, for all else is as naught in Thy sight and in the sight of them that carry the fragrance of musk. Glorified art Thou! There is none other God but Thee. Thy command hath ever held sway over all created things and Thy prohibition hath been made clear in what Thou hast revealed in the Book. By Thy glory! I find no command save through Him Whom Thou wilt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection with Thy signs, and no prohibition save for those who are veiled from Him by any of the manifestations of Thy similitudes. Were I to possess all glory yet fail to comprehend this, Thou wouldst render me abased, and were I to possess naught yet come to know this, Thou wouldst bestow upon me all glory, for I have ever been certain of the permanence of Thy Cause and have awaited Thee with the eyes of the most sincere among Thy creation. Glorified art Thou! There is no God but Thee. Thou art the One worthy of worship in truth and the One sought after in certainty. All derive their relationship from their connection to Thee, and all attain glory through seeking Thy good-pleasure. Therefore, O my God, I turn toward Thee through Thee, then through Thy Most Beautiful Names that are pleasing and well-pleasing, and through Thy Most Exalted and Transcendent Examples, beseeching Thee to send Thy blessings upon Him Whom Thou wilt make manifest and upon those in whom naught can be seen except Him, for besides this none is worthy of mention nor hath any station in the eyes of those who know Thee, that they should glorify him. Glorified art Thou! There is none other God but Thee. I bear witness before Thee and all things that were I to find Him before He maketh Himself known to me on the Day of Resurrection, and were His good-pleasure to be dearer to my heart - nay, to my breast - than all good things, how much more so when I know Him! For that is a horizon without equal, and I have known no ultimate goal besides Thee, no final end save Thee. Therefore, O God, single me out for this and cleanse me from the limitations that veil me from it, for on that Day I see creation as naught but the essence of understanding and certitude, and naught but a bare truth in a perspicuous Book. They desire but numbered days, while I desire Thy eternity and everlastingness. Glorified, glorified art Thou! \[I am exalted\] above regarding their limitations or being veiled from their Limited One. Rather, through Thee shall I glory, and in the shadow of Him Whom Thou shalt manifest have I found shelter, elevated above all created things with steadfast certitude and exalted above all existing things with clear evidence, for I have indeed gained possession of eternal glory and Thine everlasting bounty through this, while all others besides me have perished in their names and their traces have been obliterated, and all remember me since I have stood firm in this.

Praise be to Him Who hath created the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them in their essential realities, and glory be to Him Who hath brought all things into being and established them through His own Self, depositing within them His signs in their very essence. Sanctified be He Who hath been established upon the Throne through His all-merciful nature before the creation of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, casting therein the examples of His power in their abstract form. And light be unto Him Who hath illumined the creation of all things and stood firm upon the carpet of His might through the manifestation of that which hath shone forth from His hidden treasure upon that which hath been revealed through His holy signs to those in the kingdom of His earth and heaven.And majesty be unto Him from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He hath created in all things their own reality that they might be guided to what He hath ordained therein through their knowledge thereof. Exalted be His names and sanctified be the proofs of His examples. He hath ever been before all things through the existence of His Essence and will ever remain after all things through the purity of His Being, after creating a treasured essence, a pure reality, an essential being, and an impregnable selfhood. He revealed Himself to it through itself, and thus it was astounded by the astoundment of its station, was glorified by the glorification of its nearness, was beautified by the beauty of its Creator, was magnified by the greatness of its Originator, was illumined by the light of its Fashioner, was brightened by the radiance of its Former, was elevated by the loftiness of its Sovereign, was empowered by the sovereignty of its King, and was advanced by the inaccessibility of its Master.Then from the heights of its manifestation and the depths of its concealment it proclaimed that which gleamed forth in its primary horizon and shone forth in its ultimate heights - that there is no God but Him, and that His Essence cannot be comprehended, His Being cannot be described, His Reality cannot be characterized, His Uniqueness cannot be likened, and His Oneness cannot be resembled or depicted. For all upon which the name of a thing other than Him hath fallen hath been brought into existence through His creation, realized through His invention, formed through His fashioning, determined through His origination, and brought into being through His production.Exalted be the essential reality of the manifestations of His Cause above the highest flights of the contingent beings toward the heaven of its holiness, and sanctified be the signs of His primordial holiness above the most abstract of essential realities. He is as He hath ever been, and like unto what He shall ever be. The existence of His eternity is like the manifestation of His origination, and the existence of His origination is like the existence of His eternity, for all things are a mystery in \[...\] through His creation. Verily He is, hath ever been, and will ever be eternal in antiquity and sublime in perpetuity. All His names are exalted and all His examples are elevated. The heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them are filled with His light, and the earth and all that are thereon shine with His radiance. He beareth witness, and all His creation, that there is no God but Him. There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Subtle, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. Moreover, the Essence of the Seven Letters is with Him, which He hath created as His Word wherein He hath cast the signs of His power and through which He hath established what He hath willed for it in the kingdom of His heaven and the dominion of His earth of authority, and thus did He manifest it \[...\]

His authority manifested Him when all were in veils and blindness, and all were in remoteness and delusion. Through His light was guided whoso was guided, through His support was exalted whoso was exalted, through His good-pleasure was satisfied whoso was satisfied, and through His glory was glorified whoso was glorified. Indeed, ere could be counted the number of the living upon the first earth, all turned unto Him. Then through His radiance were illumined those who were illumined, from the most exalted to the most lowly, until His signs appeared and His evidences were perfected, and truth was distinguished from aught else, and separation was made between His servants. And whoso likened himself through his own desires in his worship of his Lord, verily the meteor of the light of His authority became fixed upon the horizon at the highest point possible to be fixed, and the lightning of the sun of His manifestation shone forth at the loftiest height possible to shine forth. He called all things unto God their Lord and desired that all should be detached from whatsoever might veil them from meeting their Creator. He strove in God's path with the utmost striving and endured with perfect patience for the elevation of His Cause. God bestowed upon him and upon those who descended upon him such prayers as had no equal in creation, no likeness in invention, no peer in origination, no companion in innovation, and no similitude in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Through him were guided the guided ones, through him triumphed the sincere ones, and through him were banished the veiled ones until the Day when all shall be brought before God their Lord. The Fourth in the Crimson Light in the Fourth Letter: In the Name of God, the One, the One! Praise be to God Who created all things by His command, and verily unto Him do all return. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon those who are guided and follow. And then I address thee, O Letters of that Most Exalted Name and Most Glorious Symbol, that God, exalted and mighty be He, created you only that ye should glorify Him, praise Him, proclaim His unity and magnify Him. There is no glory save in knowing Him and His good-pleasure, and naught else but the veiling from His countenance. Observe ye the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Verily the beginning of what speaketh is through the words "There is no God but God," and when elevation ceaseth from thee it is through the words "There is no God but God," and between these two all is cut off through this Word. And thou art the point of transition between negation and affirmation. And since thou wert the Letters of the Name of God, thou hast ever been beneath the shadow of affirmation and exalted above negation. From the beginning of every Manifestation to the beginning of the next Manifestation, thou seest in every moment what shineth forth as the source of sustenance and the dawning-place of signs from God, the One, the Single, Who hath no peer, no likeness, no companion, no equal, and no similitude. What God hath ordained for every soul in its life is fulfilled for it, whether it be what it loveth or what grieveth it. But there was in exaltation no abasement therein, and in might no lowliness therein, and in joy no sorrow therein, and in wealth no poverty therein, and in resistance no submission therein. For all this is at the time of thy guidance unto God and thy giving tidings of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For if thou shouldst attain unto His Manifestation, thou wouldst attain unto wealth wherein is no poverty \[...\]

And as for your inquiry about Him Whom God shall make manifest, if thou shouldst attain unto His Revelation, thou wouldst attain unto a wealth beyond which there is no poverty, and thou wouldst witness a glory beyond which there is no abasement, and a joy beyond which there is no sorrow, and an independence beyond which there is no weakness, and a power beyond which there is no submissiveness. Look not unto the limitations whereby men are veiled, but rather look unto that which His Revelation merits, whether all in creation fulfill this or fulfill it not. For at the time of His appearance, His true merit, which none can reject, is that every possessor of glory should turn unto Him, and every possessor of wealth should seek Him, and every possessor of power should prostrate before Him, and that none should be veiled from Him, even by their own existence, much less by aught else, and that all things should turn unto Him, even if by the highest that they possess. For this is the sign of humanity which God bestoweth, and thou must needs meet that Day. Be thou therefore among His guides, that thou mayest be among the letters of His oneness, which have ever guided unto Him and will ever guide unto Him. For His likeness is as the sun - if thou makest thine essence as mirrors, the sun of thy oneness will shine within thee. Yet there is One there, not thyself. And verily what thou inferrest is thy portion in creation and thy share in invention, which nothing can equal. And if thou fulfillest thy covenant, thou shalt find that all abasement hath possessed all glory in the sight of one who knoweth not God, while he who knoweth thee is worthy of glory through thy guidance unto God. If none fulfilleth this, such are among those who are veiled, and when all are cut off from their veils, they shall not find thy glory worthy of glory, for thou hast guided unto God in the name of oneness and hast inquired about the Sun of God's Manifestation, having truly followed His verses. This is the essence of knowledge and wisdom \[...\]

In His name there are four stages. The first is in the pillar of transcription, in the first letter: "In the Name of God, the Most Living, the Most Living. God, there is no God but Him, the Most Living, the Most Living. Say: God is more living than every living thing. None in the heavens or on the earth or between them can withhold himself from the sovereignty of His Living dominion. Verily He is the All-Loving, the Beloved, the Best-Beloved. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth, and unto Him do all return. Glorified be He before Whom all in the heavens and the earth stand in devotion, and unto Him do all come back.Say: He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them by His command 'Be!' and it is. He is the One Who aids whomsoever He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Loving. Believe ye then in God Who created all things by His command, for verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not. And believe ye in God Who ordained the creation of all things by His command, for verily He is the King Who passeth not away. And believe ye in God Who fashioned all things by His command, for verily He is the Just One Who wrongeth not. And prostrate yourselves before God Who created all things by His command, for verily He is the Sovereign Who changeth not. And glorify ye the praise of Him Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life, for verily there is no God but Him, the Single One Who faileth not.Say: God is the Creator of all things. Will ye not glorify Him? Say: God is the Sustainer of all things. Will ye not sanctify Him? Say: God causeth you to die and then giveth you life. Will ye not proclaim His unity? Say: God sufficeth you above all things if ye be of them that believe with certitude in God. Say: Nothing can suffice you apart from God, your Lord, if ye behold the creation of all things. All create and originate by God's leave. Will ye not see? He it is Who created all things by His command, and verily He is the Self-Subsisting Who passeth not away. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him do all return.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and unto God do all return. God giveth sovereignty to none save that they should prostrate themselves before Him Whom God shall manifest and be assured of His signs. Say: Your beginning is from God, if ye would see. Say: Your return is unto God, if ye would know. Say: In God's hands lie your ultimate return and your dwelling place. Will ye not be thankful? His are all that dwell in the night and the day, and unto Him do all return. God's are the treasuries of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. All work for God.If ye were to look upon those on earth, ye would find all moving and dwelling for God's sake, as all return unto God. None possesseth anything in truth except God, and whatsoever is beneath Him possesseth by His leave. Would ye have God possess anything when He it is Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die and giveth you life? Is there any possessor besides God who possesseth such creation? Say: Glory be to God and exalted is He above what ye mention. Say: He is the Knower of every soul. He knoweth what it hath earned and witnesseth what it earneth. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. He is the One Who originateth what He willeth by His command 'Be!' and it is. Say: Verily that Name indicateth God \[...\]"

He is the One besides Whom there is no God, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. He is the One Who creates what He willeth through His command "Be" and it is. Say: Verily this Name doth indicate God and speaketh from His presence and desireth none but Him, as though it seeth none beside Him. Thus doth God reveal Himself unto whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily He is the Quickener, the Self-Subsisting. God hath created in that Garden whatsoever your souls desire - will ye not then be thankful? Say: Therein are living creatures of every kind; when ye gaze upon them We shall speak unto you. Thus doth God create whatsoever He willeth - will ye not then be thankful? Say: Therein is everything for which there is no equal - all belong to God. We shall show you the origin of your creation that ye may witness that it is from God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, Lord of all things, Lord of the seen and the unseen, Lord of all the worlds. When God doth not permit one to be joined with what was created for him, can he be joined? Say: All are from God, but the people know not. And when he desireth to be joined, he desireth naught save God's good-pleasure, and he verily loveth to act for God his Lord. Thus doth God create thee - verily He is the Creator, the Subtle One. Then from your beginning until the time ye know yourselves \[...\] God hath sanctified His servants - verily He is the Bestower, the Generous One. Then when thou hast known thyself, thou shalt find nothing in thy actions save what thou lovest for God's sake. Thus doth God create all things - do ye not see? If thou desirest gold, thou shouldst love to gain strength through it, and thou lovest not to gain strength through it save for what returneth in thyself unto God from what thou hast desired, lest thou be abased before anyone. Thus doth God show you all your deeds that ye may be assured that ye cannot go beyond God's power. Ye desire nothing save for God's sake, though ye acknowledge it not. And if ye recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, He shall make you all for Him, for ye shall desire yourselves for Him within yourselves, if ye but observe. God hath created nothing except it desireth its own essence for His sake, whether in the heights above or in the earth below, for without this no thing would be created and ordained \[...\] in the creation of your own selves, which is the greatest of creations with God, that ye may understand in all things. Therefore all are God's, all are from God, and all return unto God. And whatsoever of His creation reacheth unto God shall on the Day of Resurrection reach unto the Manifestation of His Self, if ye but knew. Otherwise all belonged to Him before and after - an ant taketh not the measure of anything save for God's sake, how much more so one greater than it! Thus doth God set forth parables that ye may understand. He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He created you when ye were not yet cognizant upon the earth. He sustaineth you when ye were not yet existent upon the earth. He causeth you to die and giveth you life and turneth you over from a beginning that hath no beginning to an end that hath no end, that ye may be assured of God and His signs on the Day of Resurrection. This is what beareth fruit from you; otherwise your deeds appear from your own selves according to what God hath ordained for you aforetime.

Otherwise your deeds will appear from your own selves according to what God hath ordained for you before and after. There is no God but Him; all glory in His command. Ye shall believe in God, unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, He is the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. All build up the earth for Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all labor for God. None possesseth anything save by God's leave; all are His servants and unto Him shall all return.The Second Gate concerning the Pillar of Praise, in the Second Letter:In the Name of God, the Most Living, the Most Living!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the rulership and the realm of humanity. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. I testify, O my God, that the signs of Thy sovereignty shine resplendent in the kingdom of Thy earth and heaven, and the manifestations of Thy Self-Subsistence glow luminous in the essences of those whom Thou hast created by Thy command and creation. Thou art manifest above all things in sovereignty and independence, Thou art triumphant over all things in dominion and majesty, Thou art exalted above all things in might and glory, Thou art inaccessible above all things in grandeur and beauty, Thou art elevated above all things in similitude and example. Sanctified are Thy names and exalted are Thy similitudes. Thou orderest the creation of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them through the wondrous crafting of Thy wisdom, and Thou determinest the creation of all things through the manifestations of Thine eternal novelty. Thou hast exalted Thyself above all things through Thy might and made Thyself triumphant over all things through Thy grandeur. In Thee are fulfilled all attributes in their essences, and in Thee are confounded all similitudes in their realities.I shall glorify Thee beyond all that the contingent beings have glorified, and I shall sanctify Thee beyond all that the essences have sanctified. Thy blessings have ever been more than any of Thy creation can reckon, and Thy bounties exceed what any of Thy servants can mention in remembrance. Thou bestowest favor upon whomsoever Thou willest through the manifestation of Thy might and glory, and Thou raisest up whomsoever Thou desirest through Thy power and sovereignty. Unto Thee be praise throughout earth and heaven, and unto Thee be glory as long as all geometry and names shall shine forth.O God! Do Thou send down upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest of every glory its most glorious, of every majesty its most majestic, of every beauty its most beautiful, of every grandeur its most grand, of every light its most luminous, of every word its most perfect, of every name its most great, of every might its mightiest, of every will its most compelling, of every loftiness its most penetrating, of every power its most potent, of every utterance its most pleasing, of every sovereignty its most enduring, of every dominion its most glorious, of every love its most attractive, of every affection its nearest, of every exaltation its most exalted. For Thou hast rolled up the cycles and revolved the ages for the Day whereon He shall make Himself known, and all things shall know Him as the Primal Unity, wherewith no similitude can compare \[...\]

Praise be to Him Who hath caused the cycles to revolve unto the Day whereon He shall make Himself known, when all things shall testify that He is the Primal One, with Whom no similitudes can compare, and the Eternal, Ever-Abiding Living One, with Whom no equals can be likened. Thou hast created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them in honor of the splendor of His countenance, and Thou hast brought into being the whole of creation that it might enter beneath the shadow of His Cause, for He is the Best-Beloved in all creation and the Ultimate Purpose thereof. For were it not for His manifestation, who would be able to manifest Thy oneness, exalt Thy glory, magnify Thy greatness, and make evident that which Thou didst ordain in Thy creation through the decree of Thy handiwork? Therefore, O my God, after Thou hast perfected the creation of that Manifestation in His revelation - for none besides Thee can know the true measure of His revelation nor the loftiness of His might, power, sovereignty and dominion - do Thou send down upon Him from His kingdom that which shall please Him and even more than what shall please Him. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent in the hereafter and the former times, and the All-Powerful in the kingdom on high down to the primal atom, according to what Thou lovest and art pleased with.The Third Pillar in the Third Letter of Divine Unity:In the Name of God, the Most Living, the Most Living! Praise be to Him Who is detached from His creation, exalted above the mention of His servants, and sanctified beyond the praise of all else but Him. He is the First, and there is no first before Him; He is the Last, and there is no last besides Him; He is the Manifest, and there is none manifest before Him; and He is the Beholder, and there is no beholder besides Him. He hath shown His might through the essence of His sovereign Self-Subsistence, before Whose loftiness all contingent things bow down in submission, and He is unique in the kingdom of His holy eternity, before Whose exaltation all existing things humble themselves. He is the One Who existed before all things in independence, and the Creator of all things in majesty, transcendent above all things in His inaccessibility, and the Fashioner of all things in His sublimity. He is the One, not by number, and the Eternal, having neither likeness nor duration. He hath ever been living before all things, living after all things, living above all things, living beneath all things, living with all things, living when no living thing existed beside Him or apart from Him, living never deriving life from any other living thing, living creating life for every living being that can be described as living, living not characterized by attributes, giving life to every living thing by His command and bringing into existence whatsoever He willeth through His supreme craftsmanship. He is the Ever-Living Who endureth after the extinction of all things and the All-High Living One Who existed before the formation of all things. He hath sanctified Himself through the loftiness of His sovereignty \[which is\] inaccessible in its inaccessibility above every height and exaltation, and He hath glorified Himself through the loftiness of His essence \[which is\] sanctified beyond all mention and exaltation, above all joy and gladness. He beareth witness, and all His creation beareth witness, that there is no God but Him. He hath ever been the One God, Single, Eternal, Unique, Living, Self-Subsisting, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Dependent. He hath taken unto Himself neither consort nor son. He hath manifested the essence of all creation from the inmost heart of creation and the pure one who createth by command at the pinnacle of invention, that He might cause to speak what is with Him and might cause to tell what is within Him, concerning that which His utterance hath concealed about God's establishment upon the earth, and that which hath veiled Him from declaring concerning God His Creator the conditions of what He placeth upon Him of creation. Indeed He hath arisen through God, knowing \[...\]

Nothing can veil Him from receiving knowledge from God, His Creator, save the affairs laid upon Him by creation, for He stood forth knowing through God, spoke truthfully through God, and called all creation to the straight path of God. He gave glad tidings to all things of fresh knowledge of their Creator and warned all things against being bereft of knowledge of their Beloved. He testified, and all creation with Him, that through Him the camphor-like essences were renewed, the pure realities dawned forth, the essential personalities shone bright, and the abstract identities gleamed - such that He filled the pillars of all things at His appearance with the exaltation of His glorification, the inaccessibility of His praise, the transcendence of His unity, and the sublimity of His magnification and the independence of His Self-Subsistence. How exalted is His right over all who were or will be created! How glorious His bounty to all who were or will be brought into being! God's favor be upon His first and last, His outer and inner aspects, upon those guided by His guidance, those who follow His fear of God, those who are led to the heights of His glory, and those who seek knowledge of the mystery of \[that which\] befits His sanctified and sublime station. Through Him the glorifiers were strengthened and the veiled ones vanished. Through Him the sanctified ones appeared and the consulters perished. Through Him the unitarians were confounded and all others entered the shadows of negation. Through Him the magnifiers were magnified while all who belittled God's Cause returned to their own diminishment. How ripe are His gardens with those adorned and refined essences, whereby every branch of His garden was adorned with a unique name extolling His sanctity and majesty, His glory and perfection - that there is no God but Him, the Most Great, the Most High.The Fourth \[Gate\] concerning Magnification in the Fourth Letter: In the Name of God, the Most Living, the Most Living. Glory be to God, the Lord of Might and Majesty. Praise be to God, the Lord of Power and Perfection. There is no God but God, the Lord of Beauty and Countenance. God is Most Great, above all who possess strength and deeds. Verily the glory from God is upon the First One in the heights of sanctity and the summit of similitude, and upon whoever resembles the First One wherein naught is seen save the First Word that indicates God - that there is no God but Him, the Most Holy, the Most High. Thereafter, We gave thee to drink from a most pure crystal cup, water of sublime glory whereby God was unified in His Essence \[-\] that there is no God but Him, the Most Mighty, the Most High. Then from a green crystal cup that which unifies God thy Lord in His attributes - that there is no God but Him, the Lord of Might and Majesty. Then from a green crystal cup red wine without finding intoxication in its stupor or bewilderment beneath its praise, as thou wouldst unify God in the apex of certitude and height of exaltation - that there is no God but Him, the Single in Power and Independence. And then We shall give thee to drink from a red crystal cup, as I found not with thee that day a ruby cup - else would it have been living waters and purified honey in a paradise wherein such a Name should have before it a ruby cup. Therefore thou shalt shine forth with the effulgences that shone from the dawning of the Sun of Firstness, for what thou findest in mirrors of reflections - whether white, yellow, green or red - is naught but through the manifestation of what shone forth and the rising of what illumined from the horizon of that First One, the Lord of Might \[...\]

Look at the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - not at this time, for on that Day all who possess truth will attribute themselves to the Point of the Bayan. The Paradise of Names has been adorned - all proclaim: "The Name is within me, I am the Name, all stand through me." The Manifestation of Divinity proclaims what God has ordained within Him of the exaltation of His loftiness and the elevation of His inaccessibility, that all make mention through Him. Then the name of Unity and Oneness and all names in their highest exaltation and loftiest growth proclaim: "We are all mirrors of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and we all point to the Point of the Bayan, and we all return to it in our return." But what has been written at the end of the manifestation of the Bayan is like what was written at the end of the manifestation of the Furqan (Quran). For all that came into being in that Dispensation came into being through Muhammad's manifestation in twenty-three years - all those infinite glorious multiplicities and diverse glorious conditions of the manifestations of Paradise and shadows of the Fire were brought into being through that divine Point, for had He not appeared, this would not have been. For had God not made Muhammad manifest until the appearance of the Bayan, none would have remained alive on earth except \[...\] Ali. Therefore observe how all that came into being after and with Him, whether living or otherwise, whether high or low, when God made Him manifest to gather the fruits of what He had planted - all are veiled by something, as if they were unaware of the source of their existence and heedless of what brought their beings into reality. The sun of His knowledge has dawned among the learned, yet observe how many solar reflections in mirrors say "I am, I am!" Say: Away with you! What are you and your knowledge? Had you not existed afterwards you would not have been created, so how about your knowledge? Look to Him through Whom you were created and be not veiled from the fruit of your creation. For your knowledge of things does not bring you near to what God has commanded. Do you not see all religions - do you find their knowledge with you or your knowledge with them? These draw near to God through knowledge of what has been ordained for them, while you draw near through what God has explained to you of His Cause. Similarly has He caused the glorious manifestations of knowledge to descend in their mirrors, such that if you look to the furthest existence you see it saying "I am," not realizing that its reality comes through the appearance of Him Who has appeared, O Most Upright of the upright! Without Him this would be nothing. Then observe on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - all act for the sake of the Point of the Bayan's manifestation, yet remain veiled from Him Who made them manifest for His own manifestation, Who is Him Whom God shall make manifest. By Him Who created the seed and formed the breath! If anyone attributes himself to the Point of the Bayan yet recognizes Him and hears of His manifestation but remains veiled to the extent of saying "nay," God's most binding decree upon him is that he should annihilate himself lest there remain on earth any who believe not in God his Lord \[...\]

And among the most imperative decrees of God upon him is that he should utterly efface himself, lest there remain upon the earth anyone who hath not believed in God, his Lord (unless he return unto Him and repent before God, his Lord). For I have not planted that tree without fruit, nor do I desire aught but for His sake. How can one subsist on the provision of his Lord from the beginning of that Revelation until the day of His Manifestation, yet fail to fulfill God's covenant with Him Who created him, sustained him, caused him to die, and brought him back to life? And all who are in the Bayan are certain until the day of His appearance. And verily, similar words were spoken by Muhammad to those who were Mine, and similar words were spoken by Muhammad concerning His future manifestation, for in the Quran there was nothing less than this. But none remember save those endowed with understanding. Beware, beware lest thou find thyself lacking in any aspect pertaining to the manifestation of My Self. Were God not to manifest Me in that Revelation, I would be as nothing. Likewise is all that was brought into being through the manifestation of Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Look not upon it with the eye of sudden transformation, for such transformation doth not occur in the countenances of those who appeared in the First of the First, who is Muhammad, and who shall appear in the Last of the Last, who is Muhammad. His likeness is as the sun - consider its rising as His manifestation and its setting as His ascension. When it rises, God creates through it creation as He had created before. How many different sects dost thou see in that day, each claiming adherence to God's religion? Yet none hath any right to claim relationship with God save those who follow God in the manifestation of His innovation and the revelation of His newness. This is what I have counseled thee and all the worlds.The sixth chapter of the first Unity, concerning the sixth day of the month, regarding the knowledge of the name Al-Qayyum, which hath four stations. The first concerneth verses in the first letter:In the Name of God, the Most Steadfast, the Most SteadfastIn the Name of God, the Most Steadfast, the Most SteadfastSay: God is more steadfast than any possessor of steadfastness. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereign steadfastness. Verily, He is the All-Steadfast, the Sustainer, the Righteous. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and unto God shall all return. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. He it is Who giveth life and death, and unto God shall all return. He it is Who createth what He willeth by His command, and unto God shall all return. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and unto God shall all return. He it is Who giveth life and death, and unto God shall all be raised. The earth trembleth before the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, and all faces humble themselves before the Living, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is the Creator of all things, and unto Him shall all return. His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day. Say: All are His worshippers. Say: Verily, that Name is the Joseph of Names. God hath made their numbers identical, that ye might thereby draw nigh unto God. Say: All that ye describe by that Name was not yours before \[...\]

Say: Through this unique One ye draw near unto God. All that ye describe by means of this Name had no existence before nor shall it exist thereafter. But God hath ever been, and verily He standeth over every soul, knowing what it hath earned and what it shall earn. And verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. This is the Name through which ye attain unto all good. This is the Name through which ye free yourselves from all sorrow. This is the Name through which ye shall possess all that ye love. Should ye make the mirror of that Name He Whom God shall make manifest, then shall ye determine all that hath been determined, envision all that hath been envisioned, decree all that hath been decreed, and judge according to all that hath been revealed. Say: Verily this is the Name of God Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And should it be mentioned without its first letter, it is like the sun's reflection in mirrors. Thus do ye draw evidence from all names. Say: This is God's remembrance of His own Self, that there is no God but Him, the Living, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that ye may through it recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest by His command and arise by God's command. Say: All besides God was created by His command and there is no God but God, the Lord of the worlds. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. This is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: God is your Deity and your Sustainer, then your Lord and your King, then your Creator and your Sovereign, then your Fashioner and your Ordainer, then your Originator and your Former. His indeed is the creation and the command, before and after. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Put your trust in God, the Living, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, if ye desire to grieve not. Within every name dwelleth countless creations, even as ye behold this day. How then can what dwelleth beneath the shadow of God's Name be numbered? Say: Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe. To God belongeth the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is naught but glorifieth its Lord with praise and prostrateth itself before God, its Lord. And verily the glory from God resteth upon all names, now and before and after.The second, regarding communion in the second letter:In the Name of God, the Most Steadfast, the Most SteadfastGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thou hast stood over all things through the sovereignty of Thine eternal might and dominated all things through the essence of Thy holy dominion. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Living, Self-Subsisting. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. The heavens and all therein glorify Thy praise, the earth and all thereon sanctify Thy remembrance, and all between them speak Thy praise. I therefore bear witness, with all things, that Thine is the might and majesty, Thine the power and perfection, Thine the presence and beauty, Thine the countenance and perfection, Thine the grandeur and independence \[...\]

I testify that Thine is the independence, and Thine is the power and action, and Thine are the similitudes and examples, and Thine is the might and justice, and Thine is the mercy and grace, and Thine is the glory and invincibility, and Thine is the dominion and exaltation, and Thine is the joy and gladness, and Thine is the affliction and detachment, and Thine is the earthly sovereignty and the Kingdom, and Thine is the majesty and omnipotence, and Thine is the power, and Thine is the sovereignty over the human realm, and Thine is all that is seen and unseen from the highest heights to the primal atom. Sanctified are Thy names, exalted are Thy examples, glorified are Thy manifestations, and beautified are Thy mysteries. Thou art the First and there is naught before Thee, and Thou art the Last and there is naught after Thee, and Thou art the Manifest and there is naught besides Thee, and Thou art the Enduring with all things.I beseech Thee by all Thy names, and by those most mighty with Thee and most enduring before Thee, for naught is seen in Thy names except Thee, and none in Thy examples save Thee. I have beseeched Thee by the source of all Thy names and the end of all Thy manifestations, that Thou mayest send down upon the First Unity and upon him who hath guided to Thee and become established in Thee - who seeketh naught from Thee save Thy glory and speaketh naught except what is within Thyself - Thy names, the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, the Nominal and the Essential, the Unity and the Oneness, the All-Merciful and the Most Upright, and whatsoever Thou hast concealed, O my God, for all are Thy names and Thy proofs.I beseech Thee by him whom Thou hast sanctified above all Thy names and through whom Thou hast opened the gate of the creation of all things, when Thou didst find him prostrate before Thee through Thy signs, and upon all the manifestations of Thy names and the proofs of Thy sovereignty until the Day wherein Thou shalt manifest Thyself and send down from the Manifestation of Thyself Thy proof whereby Thy favor hath been perfected upon all created things and Thy sovereignty hath appeared unto all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven - that Thou mayest make the entire Bayan and all who are therein as words affirming him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, where no letter of sorrow shall be witnessed from Thee. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest and mighty over what Thou desirest. There is no might nor power except through Thee, and unto Thee is the final return.The Third in the Sermons, concerning the Third Letter. In the Name of God, the Most Upright, the Most Upright! Glorified be He Who hath ascended above the heights of all things through the loftiness of His Essence, and glorified be He Who hath risen above all things through the exaltation of His Being, and glorified be He Who hath subdued all things through the dominion of His Omnipotence, and glorified be He Who hath possessed all things through the sovereignty of His Oneness, and glorified be He through Whom all things are guided by the lights of the radiance of His Face. He is the One, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, Who hath ever been and ever shall be, and the Living, the Eternal, the All-Holy, without geometry or decline. He hath ever revealed Himself unto all who are in the kingdom of His earth and heaven through the wonders of the manifestations of His Self-Subsistence and the dawning-places of the conditions of His Eternity. He is the First - there was nothing before Him; and He is the Last - there shall be nothing after Him; and He is the Manifest - there is nothing above Him; and He is the Seeing - there is nothing beyond Him. He is the Sovereign, invincible in might and omnipotence, and the King, sanctified in power and divinity. He hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them through the lights of the wondrous manifestations of His sovereignty. Then He established Himself upon the throne of His power through the appearance of His revelation unto it through Him, speaking of what He hath ordained in creation and bearing witness to what shall come to pass in invention, that there is no God but He, the Lord of might \[...\]

And as witness to what shall come in creation, that there is no God but Him, the Lord of Might and Majesty, the Possessor of Power and Perfection, the Lord of Grandeur and Independence, the Sovereign of Glory and Splendor, there is no God but Him, the Great, the Most High. He hath chosen from among His creation a treasured gem, a subtle camphor essence, an eternal archetype, a pure and holy reality, an everlasting exemplar, and revealed Himself to it through itself that there is no God but Him. Then He created all things through it and ordained the measures of all things according to what He had ordained therein. It is the First Word, the Most Exalted Paradise, the Pure Leaf, the Greatest Sign, the Supreme Countenance, the Most Glorious Face in the beginning and the end. Its verses have been made manifest, its words have shone forth, its revelations have dawned, its evidences have been perfected, and its words have been made firm. There is nothing that can be mentioned as having existence except that it hath been brought into being through its creative act and through the letters of its life, then through all the letters of its names - through the glory from its Lord, then the majesty from its Creator, then the beauty from its Master, then the grandeur from its King, then the light from its Fashioner - exalting all who are guided by its guidance in its loftiness, its elevation, its exaltation, its inaccessibility, and its joy in the self through the grace of its Lord and by virtue of the bounty of its Revealer. Therefore, bear witness at this moment with a testimony numbering the heavens through His grace, the earth through His bounty, and all that lies between them through His favor, that there is no God but Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and on earth and between them glorify Him, and verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved. The Fourth, concerning the interpretations of the Fourth Letter: In the Name of God, the Most Steadfast, the Most Steadfast. Praise be to God, the Lord of all things, to the number of what can be counted and beyond what is pleasing. And verily the glory from God be upon the first letters according to what multiplies in His knowledge from the last to the first. And then thou shalt bear witness through thine own reality and the essence of thy being that the Divine Essence can neither be known nor indicated, and that all that each one understands of unity in Essence, Attributes, Acts and Worship is but what God hath revealed to each one through Himself, even as He revealed to the Primal Point, the First Will. But when thou desirest to sail upon the sea of knowledge and wisdom, the conditions of creation and the mystery of reality, it behooveth thee to be knowing of God, exalted be His glory, and encompassing all that hath been sent down from His presence with His sanction - not in terms of finite forms and limited examples, but rather through thy vision of the essence around which words revolve and the pure reality about which indications circle. Thou shalt regard all manifestations from the beginning of revelation until the appearance of the next as balanced manifestations, and shalt see in each manifestation an exalted station. For the later manifestation is exalted through the appearance of knowledge and wisdom, and is elevated through the revelation of the mystery of reality \[...\]

The guidance unto God, its Lord, hath encompassed and moved about that which hath shone forth from its presence. Thus dost thou observe in the Bayan how many divine philosophers and heavenly divines appear therein, yet all soar by virtue of what the Primal Reality hath caused to soar, and all journey according to what the Sun of Divinity hath established by its Lord's leave. Verily the essence of the knowledge of the Bayan shall be made manifest at the end of the manifestation that is manifested through the appearance of that Pillar who shall extract the mysteries of the Bayan. Those around Him shall witness the realities of clear vision, and all shall prepare themselves for the day of meeting their Lord. For there shalt thou see each one saying "I am a follower of God's will and an awaiter of His countenance." But when God manifesteth the Primal Reality, then each one followeth. And if thou seest no one in the Bayan, then find him holding fast to what God hath revealed, that perchance on that day thy foot may not slip at the end of the Manifestation, and that the signs of that hiddenness may not veil thee from attaining the presence of that for which thou wast created. For at the end of the Manifestation, the gems of knowledge and wisdom shall be gathered, and abundance shall be perfected to the extent possible, and the Word shall be exalted as befitteth it. Verily that is the day of gathering gems from creation and beholding the essences of the Manifestations unto him who looketh to the Source of the Cause. Therefore on that day hold fast unto God, exalted be His glory, and look not to who was a believer in the Bayan. And whosoever heareth thee, O Most Splendid of the Splendid Ones, speaking most excellently of God - follow him. For He Whom God shall make manifest shall appear with such transcendent glory as hath no like in creation, and with such resplendent exaltation as hath no semblance in invention. All that thou hast revealed for thyself cannot follow the words of thy Lord, and all that groaneth and reposeth in the knowledge of the hidden is like the manifest Manifestation, that perchance thou mayest find a way unto God. Otherwise, all on that day shall claim His good-pleasure and nearness, of all who follow the Bayan, but none shall attain unto Him save those possessed of insight. Even as if thou wert in the dispensation of the Furqan - God had ordained that all who believed in it were awaiting the appearance of Him Who was promised by Muhammad, the Messenger of God, yet how was it that none attained unto Him save the pure and sincere ones? This was only due to their exalted capacity to bear the Cause of God and their sublime vision toward God, while those beneath them were unable to bear it, nay, they wrongfully judged that such glory and exaltation was not by God's leave. Beware, beware lest thou be exalted through vain imaginings or be uplifted through mystical abstractions, for on the Day of Manifestation thou shalt not be able to ascend unto God, the Lord of Names and Attributes, nor take shelter in the shadow of God's Cause, except that thou look to the essence of proof in the clear verses without asking "why" or "how." For similarly before, thou hast witnessed how many servants were exalted in knowledge and wisdom such that none equal to them could be seen upon the earth, yet they comprehended not that for which they were created. Rather, they were veiled by what they knew. Following what was revealed in the Bayan in the ways of the spirit and delight shall profit thee not \[...\]

The fragrance and repose in the repository of utterance shall endure until the Day when God shall cause the Sun of Truth to shine forth through the manifestation of His Self and the recognition of all His names and attributes, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Sovereign, the Most Exalted. Beware of the multitude of veils arising from matters of learning, for they shall profit thee not. Rather, if thou art learned in the essence of divine ordinances and attentive to the reality of their purpose, thy knowledge shall benefit thee on the Day of Resurrection when Truth is made manifest, and thy knowledge of God shall enable thee to attain unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, independent of all learning and wisdom, if thou art to be numbered among the rightly guided.The Seventh Gate of the First Vahid of the Seventh Day of the Year, concerning the knowledge of the Name of Glory (Bahi), which hath four stations. The first, regarding the words "There is none other God but God," in the first letter. In the Name of God, the Most Glorious of the Most Glorious. God - there is none other God but Him, the Most Glorious of the Most Glorious. Say: God is more glorious than all who possess glory, and none in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can withstand the power of His glorious sovereignty. Verily, He hath ever been supremely glorious and resplendent.Glorified be He Whom all in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them do glorify. Say: All are submissive unto Him. Glorified be He before Whom all in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them do prostrate themselves. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Glorified be He Whom all in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them do praise. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.He it is Who hath created all things by His command, and verily He is the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He it is Who determineth the measure of all things by His command. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is powerful over all things. Unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day, and verily He is the Single One, the Inaccessible, the Impregnable.That is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. He it is Who createth what He willeth by His command "Be," and it is. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all return. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and in the day. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth the origination of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All shall return unto Him.Say: Were ye to observe the glory of all things, then would ye not be veiled from the command of God. I shall show you the glory of your own selves, if ye can comprehend, from the first moment ye were created by God's command until the last moment ye shall be mentioned. Work ye for God, that God may accept it from you - this is the essence of the glory of all your deeds, could ye but understand. This shall not be made manifest except through a Book sent down by God unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. What aileth you that ye remain not wonderstruck? And were ye to observe the glory of all things, then would ye not be veiled from the command of God. Should ye possess all things yet believe not in God and His signs, would any glory be yours? Say: Glory be to God above what ye mention! For then would all glory be cut off from you, when ye believe not in God. But should ye believe in God, though ye possess nothing, then would all glory from God be yours, if ye be of those who \[...\].

Possess nothing, for then will all glory be yours from God, if ye be of them who believe in God and His signs. Think not this to be imaginary, for verily it is more evident than all else, if ye be of them who are assured of God and His signs. Should someone possess all the glory that is on earth, yet believe not in God, would it profit him? And when God's Cause is made manifest, We shall strip from him whatsoever glory he possesseth on earth - this is a truth which all can grasp, if they would but reflect a little. However, should one possess nothing, yet believe in God and His signs, God would bestow upon him the glory of all things as a bounty from his Lord. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.This is before ye enter the Bayan; then ponder ye thereon. All who do not regard the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest as equal to their own selves or their possessions - should they turn unto Him, they are honoured servants of God. And if guidance be not decreed for them, they have no glory in His sight. Fear ye God, then fear Him. For verily, whoso beholdeth the glory of all things, nothing shall withhold him from his Lord's good-pleasure. Thus hath God counselled you that ye may attain unto all good.We shall indeed remove the veil from your inner sight that ye may be assured of God and His signs. Circle ye round the House, then follow him who is most learned among you in what he relateth of your Imams' words. Let him make his own glory and knowledge naught but the word commanded by a mighty and exalted Imam. Then if ye consider the loftiness of his station and what he hath related, it returneth to Muhammad's word, for this is all his glory, if ye would but understand. Then whatsoever Muhammad hath related - his glory returneth to what God hath revealed of verses. For were this not from One whose word is to be followed, then all glory would belong to God's word, but ye do not remember.And verily God's word is established only when all on earth are powerless to produce the like of what God hath revealed. Then is it proven to be from God - this is the glory of all that is in your religion, but ye do not reflect. This is like unto countless jewels known only to God. Then all their glory equalleth six red rubies, then God maketh their glory as six green emeralds, then God maketh their glory as four yellow topazes, then God maketh their glory as two white pearls, then God maketh their glory as a single gem. Then in that One is the glory of all those pieces and what lieth beyond them of countless jewels. This is a similitude of Him Whom God shall make manifest - do ye not desire to understand?And verily your knowledge is like unto this in whatever glory it possesseth, if it be for God, since all that ye have learned is to attain what God hath commanded you. Thus the glory of all your knowledge is what ye know of God's Cause, for all return unto God. And naught shall give life to people on the Day of Resurrection save the knowledge of glory, whereby they shall be cut off from multiplicity \[...\]

Nothing shall bring people to life on the Day of Resurrection save the knowledge of Baha, whereby they shall be cut off from multiplicity and return to the splendor of all things. Then shall you perceive that Primal Essence, then shall you perceive that Primal Essence, then shall you perceive that Primal Essence. And if you possess the knowledge of Baha, it shall save you on the Day of Resurrection, if you return to the knowledge of Baha. But you pay no heed. Verily your path, from the beginning of your lives to their end, will weary you. You say: "Perhaps something of God's Cause and His Book is veiled from us," knowing well that if you were to look upon that splendor, you would say: "Perhaps God will be pleased with us, for we were not created in vain." Then when you are asked how God's good-pleasure with you is made manifest, you instantly reply: "Through that which was revealed unto Muhammad, the like of which none in all the worlds can produce." When the Manifestation of His Self speaks from His presence, that indeed is what God hath spoken in truth, and unto Me shall ye return. And likewise unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, but ye understand not. God counseleth you regarding the knowledge of Baha, if ye would but turn unto it. That which God hath commanded you - verily on the Day of Resurrection ye shall be saved thereby, for on that Day all who are in the Bayan shall see everything. They desire to act in such wise as to attain the good-pleasure of God, but they shall not attain it save through attaining the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest. And all besides them are veiled from the command of their Lord, if they would but see. Were they to look upon the splendor of their own creation, they would seek the good-pleasure of God through His Word, which standeth above all the worlds. This is the splendor of all things, if ye would but understand. For nothing besides this shall profit you, while this shall profit you above all things. This is the splendor of God, attributed unto His Self - ye look unto the face of God. Look ye therefore to what was before that Manifestation, for verily the splendor of all that God created in the Gospel was not made manifest until after God had manifested Muhammad and 'Ali believed in Him. For were it not for these two, how would ye have entered into that Faith? Then look ye unto the manifestation of the Bayan, for all the splendor of the Qur'an returned unto the Primal Point. For had He not manifested Himself by His Lord's command, how would ye have comprehended that Faith? Then after Him, the splendor of all the Furqan belonged to those who believed in Him, then to the first ones, then to those most ancient. Thus hath God made all the splendor of the Bayan to belong to Him Whom God shall make manifest, then to those who believe in Him, then to those most ancient - they are the most ancient ones. But ye shall be separated from that Essence, for verily on the Day of Resurrection ye shall be veiled. For if ye were to find the splendor of the Bayan, it would suffice you above all its letters. But this is difficult for you - to cut off your gaze from all the Bayan and look unto all its splendor. But ye shall trust in God, your Lord, and look unto the Point of the Bayan, that perchance ye may be able on that Day to see. And God loveth no knowledge like the knowledge of Baha, for thereby is known the worth of all things. All the dominion of the earth whereon ye dwell and return - were ye to reckon its splendor, it would perhaps not equal a ruby's weight, though no limit can be set to such a measure.

Limitless indeed is this boundary in the eyes of that Balance, yet all this doth revolve around that center, if ye be of them that understand. Even so doth all knowledge revolve around the Command of God. Thus do ye comprehend the splendor of all knowledge, lest the books of the Bayan veil you from the utterance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye desire salvation on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, He shall manifest the splendor of all things in two words - if ye utter them ye shall be saved. Bear ye witness that there is no God but Him, and that He Whom God shall make manifest is the splendor of all that God hath created or will create. Thus do ye comprehend, through God's command from His presence, every command.The Second, in remembrance of the Point of the Bayan in the Second Letter:In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Glorified art Thou, O my God! Thou art the Creator of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, the Subduer of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou hast ever been supreme above all contingent beings, manifest above all existing things, inaccessible above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, exalted above all created things, transcendent above all atoms, and sovereign over all who dwell in the realms of names and attributes. Thou hast ever been sanctified through might and omnipotence, glorified through grandeur and divinity, exalted through dominion and might, possessed of all things through sovereignty and glory, and elevated above all things through sublime holiness and the manifestations of might and the unseen. All creation is in Thy grasp. Thou wert before all things, and Thou shalt be after all things. I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, the might and the grandeur, the power and the glory, the sovereignty and the earthly realm, the majesty and the beauty, the countenance and the perfection, the greatness and the independence, the similitude and the examples, the glory and the inaccessibility, the joy and the gladness, the trial and the detachment, the bounties and the favors, the guides and the names, and all that hath \[emanated\] from the treasuries of Thy Command and the manifestations of Thy creation. Thou hast ever been one God, single, eternal, unique, self-subsisting, everlasting, endless, dependable, inaccessible, exalted, transcendent, sanctified, mighty, resplendent, magnificent, luminous, and sovereign. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life. Verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Just Who oppresseth not, and the Unique Who escapeth not. Within Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Make known unto me, O my God, in every condition the splendor of all things, lest I be veiled on the Day of Resurrection from the manifestation of Thy Self, for I would surely prostrate in that Resurrection before that which Thy creation possessed not the knowledge of splendor, thus are all veiled from the most exalted by the most lowly. Therefore make known unto me and unto all Thy creation, O my God, in such wise that they may believe in Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, even though they possess all things, for their possession of all things shall profit them not, but if they are guided by Thy guidance it shall profit them, and if they choose Thy good-pleasure it shall cause them to endure in Thy Book. All act for Thy face and Thy good-pleasure, for that is the essence of essences and the splendor of all splendor, yet none pay heed to this save Thy chosen ones.

But none understood this save Thy chosen ones, and none recognized this save those who are guided by Thee, for all know not the Essence nor are able to grasp it. And verily I find the knowledge of Thy creation to be of the stations of all things, for no knowledge guides except through the existence of the known, nor is there glory save for those who follow Thee in every Manifestation. Therefore, O my God, make my knowledge to be of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, for my knowledge of all things profiteth me not except that Thou make my knowledge to be of Him, for that verily profiteth me. And before His appearance, make my knowledge to be of what Thou hast revealed in the Bayan according to the essence of Thy purpose, for verily He is the Primal Point. And I know not of my following Thy commandments save for the exaltation of His Word, nor of my abstaining from what Thou hast forbidden save for the protection of His loftiness. Therefore, O my God, aid me to attain Thy good-pleasure - Word \[which is\] Thy Paradise and Thy good-pleasure, and that is Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and the first to believe in Him, and besides this and that I desire not to make mention. Therefore, O my God, raise me up through the dominion of Thy holy oneness, and strengthen me, O my God, through the sovereignty of the might of Thy singleness, and cause to descend, O my God, in Thy Most Glorious Name, all Thy glory, and make it, O my God, to transcend every glorious thing through Thy glory, for verily I seek Thy forgiveness for mentioning Thy glory through the glory of Thy creation, for the glory of all things besides Thee profiteth me not in relation to Thy glory, and Thy glory sufficeth me beyond the glory of all things. And I have found no glory more glorious than what Thou hast manifested in the Point of the Bayan, and Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection as Thou willest, or after it the Letters of the Living shall be glorified through His glory and all names shall be exalted through His glory. And likewise on the Day of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, all who are brought into being through His manifestation are examples of His glory, until the numbers of His manifestation multiply until Thou fillest Thy heavens and Thy earth and what is between them with His manifestation, where none is seen except Him and none is seen besides Him, for naught is seen in Him save Thee and in His mention save Thy presence. Therefore, O my God, store up for Him from the treasuries of Thy Cause what beseemeth the loftiness of Thy holiness and bounty, and from the treasuries of Thy creation what is worthy of the court of Thy grace and favor, for verily Thou art the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful.The Third \[Gate\] concerning the Divine Unity, in the Third Letter: In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God Who hath singled Himself out through might and majesty, and sanctified Himself through holiness and beauty, and elevated Himself above likeness and similitudes, and transcended resemblance and deeds. He hath ever been and ever shall be before all things without geometry or decline, and He shall ever be and ever remain after all things without geometry or transition. He is the One manifest above all contingent beings and the One dominant over all existing things, and He is the Most High above all essences and the One who abideth after the passing of all created things, and He is the Sovereign over all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He hath transcended through the loftiness of His Being above all mention and exposition, and been sanctified through the sublimity of His Essence above all geometry and explanation. He beareth witness, and all His creation, that there is no God but Him, the One, the Bestower. The sovereign realities of His dominion have ever shone forth upon all that hath been created through origination, and the essential qualities of His holy and eternal dominion have remained inaccessible to all in creation. He created naught save through His command, and He hath been exalted above all possessed of existence through the sovereignty of His justice. He is the One, matchless in numerical calculation \[...\]

He hath risen above all things through the sovereignty of His justice. He is the One, without parallel in number, and the Most Glorious, without likeness among opposites. All must worship Him according to the essence of what He hath created and will create, all must acknowledge His oneness based on the reality of what He hath brought into being and will bring into being, all must sanctify Him according to the nature of what He hath established and will establish, and all must glorify Him according to the identity of what He hath ordained and will ordain. He is the One Who hath borne witness unto His own Self by His own Self, and Who is sanctified from association with aught else through the loftiness of His names and attributes. He beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and all are His worshippers. Furthermore, He testifieth that the One manifest in every Manifestation is from Him, and the One concealed in every concealment is from His presence. He is the Primal Will and the Most Exalted Word, through which God hath caused His splendor to shine forth through its own self, and hath cast into its essence the example of its revelation. He hath manifested it in every dispensation through the utmost of what is possible therein, until the manifestations culminated in what God hath revealed in the Point of the Bayan, and the concealments ended in what God hath caused to speak in the Point of the Bayan. Through His manifestation, our realities have testified that He is the One manifest in every manifestation and concealed in every concealment, transcendent above all things yet near unto all things. God beareth witness unto this, as doth His own Self, and those who are guided by His guidance from among all things that can be named, that He is the First in all manifestations and the Last in all revelations, the Outward in the kingdom of earth and heaven, and the Inward in the kingdom of names and attributes. We have believed in Him at the time of His manifestation with our entire being, our realities, our souls, and our identities, and we shall prepare ourselves for His next manifestation according to what God hath ordained for us from His presence, and for those whom He hath ordained for us from among the pathways of His holiness and the embodiments of His Cause. We have no power except by God's leave. In Him do we place our trust, and in God let the faithful servants place their trust.The Fourth, concerning the Fourth Letter, concerning \[the Shi'ih\]:In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God Who hath created all things by His command. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Indeed, the glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon those who resemble that Unity wherein naught is seen save the First Outward One. Furthermore, ye shall bear witness that the creation of a thing is not complete until it culminateth in the four stages which God hath ordained for it. Verily, fire doth not complete its manifestation except through air, nor air except through water, nor water except through base clay, which is the pillar of life, as it appeareth not save in these six primary \[elements\], multiplying until God, exalted be He, numbereth them. However, thou shalt see naught in the first, nor the second, nor the third, nor the fourth, save God Who createth all things and provideth for them, Who causeth all things to die and giveth them life. For verily, that which is manifest in the First Unity is none other than the Point, and in all numbers the First Unity is manifest. No night or day dawneth except that the First Unity is alive as it was on the first day, but thou shalt not know what hath been decreed for each one in the Book until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For on that Day, whosoever accepteth the Cause of God from His presence, verily he shall be the place of manifestation of those lights \[...\]

No day hath been ordained in the Book save the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for on that Day whosoever accepteth the Command of God from Him - He verily is the Source of the effulgence of those lights and the Treasury of those mysteries. Even as God initiated the creation of the Bayan through them, so shall He cause the creation of the Bayan to be renewed through them. God will bring forth the next creation through the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest as He pleaseth. And in every Revelation the degrees of His manifestation are not perfected except through these ranks, as We have explained to thee repeatedly concerning the mention of the Point, that thou mayest comprehend the mystery of unity in the uttermost degree of multiplicity, and that thou mayest behold the splendor of the Manifestations of that Name. For each one hath according to what they have earned, even as thou observest in fruits how God hath preferred some above others.Thus doth God cause the Command to return to human temples and divine essences that shine forth, deriving their being from the One, the Pre-existent, the Ancient of Days. If thou didst wish to observe the fruits of the Quran before the advent of the Bayan, then look and thou shalt see fruits that were borne from Muhammad's Revelation - some were fruits of the tree of affection and love, like the companions of the Most Exalted Paradise, some were fruits of paradise and obedience, and some were fruits of the word of obedience, wherein thou seest the degrees of that creation, each one according to the manner of his obedience to God's Messenger. For if they behold in all fruits the Water of Life, therein is God's Command from Muhammad, the Manifestations of His Cause and the gates of His grace. Therefore it behooveth not the lofty to reject the lowly, nor the lowly the lofty, for both are in their stations. But glory and splendor belong to him who beholdeth the beauty of all those fruits, since all this returneth to the knowledge of God and His Manifestation in the name of His concealment.Therefore have the companions of that Paradise taken the virgin gardens of the Paradise of the Bayan, for with them is the beauty of existence, while those beneath them remain bound by limitations. Though they had beauty in their sphere before the Manifestation, their beauty was according to their station. Consider the beauty of ten thousand mithqals of iron - it equalleth one mithqal of gold. Likewise, ten thousand worlds wherein was the beauty of knowledge would equal the beauty of that mithqal of gold in a world where there was knowledge of God and the Manifestation of His Self. And We show thee this that thou mayest witness with thine own eyes. Though thou perform all the deeds of Pharaohs, yet watch that not an atom's weight be considered equal if thou art following thine Imam. Look at all thy labor in thy deeds, for the essence of that Word, then look at the fruit of following thine Imam, for it is the command of thy Messenger, then the command of thy Messenger for it is God's command. Therefore that Word is the essence of all thy deeds.Hence on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, all that thou hast done will be annulled by a single command from Him, for it is a divine command, and all thy deeds will be confirmed by a single command from Him. Observe on that Day the learned who study limitless sciences to understand His words - this is the fruit of all they possess. Were they to look upon that fruit they would not know a single letter, for the sake of following the command of their Messenger, and the command of their Messenger for the sake of the words of their Lord. Thus doth one comprehend the words of his Lord \[...\]

Their Messenger commanded them for the sake of the words of their Lord. Thus, whoever comprehends the words of their Lord and holds within his grasp the essence of all things should bestow the best teaching like unto this - but God is exalted above this. Therefore, on the Day of Manifestation people are veiled by the knowledge of the Baha, for from the first day of the revelation of the Bayan, all who follow the Quran act according to what was revealed therein, and all have acquired every knowledge to comprehend the eloquence of the Quran, that their religion might rest upon the clear evidence of the inability of all on earth to produce its like. Yet this is the fruit of all their knowledge: they hear the verses of God but pay no heed to that which would profit them from what they have acquired.Therefore, look to the splendor of all that is within your grasp, for this is what will save you on the Day of Resurrection, not attention to the conditions of your multiplication. Verily, from the beginning of his life to its end, the servant strives with utmost endeavor that nothing should proceed from him save what he imagines to be the good-pleasure of God - though God's good-pleasure is not imagined, but rather His good-pleasure with the servant is the good-pleasure of the Manifestation of His Self, for this is an actual reality, even as God hath revealed: "We were well-pleased with Him Whom We shall make manifest."Therefore observe that the good-pleasure of God is an established and verified utterance, judged by one who knows it, and if everyone possessed of knowledge judges it, O Most Exalted of the exalted ones! At times the Manifestation of God's good-pleasure appears, yet the one who strives for God's good-pleasure pays no attention that all his deeds are for the sake of that Word, that God would reveal His good-pleasure with that servant in respect to whom He desires. But since he does not look to the splendor of all his deeds, he pays no heed and sees it after his death. Exalted is God above this! How could God be pleased after death with one with whom He was not pleased on the Day of His Manifestation?By Him Who splits the seed and creates the soul, from the beginning of that Manifestation until now, I have seen no one look to the splendor of what they do. Some circumambulate, some perform pilgrimage, some pray, some give alms, some fast - none can count their numbers save God. Yet they are veiled in their deeds which profit them not, for they perform these that God might be pleased with them, while God has manifested the Source of His good-pleasure and desires to be pleased with them, but they desire it not. From this it becomes evident that they do not act for God that He might be pleased with them, but rather their souls have become accustomed to performing acts of which they are unaware.Therefore, O thou Ninth Word and Mystery concealed within the Secret of Reality, thou hast never ceased and wilt never cease to look to the splendor of knowledge and deed. For verily, if one performs no deeds from the beginning of his life to its end, but on the Day of Resurrection - the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - He says "I am pleased with thee," that one has attained the fruit of all deeds and reached the summit of all glory. But if one has strived in his deeds yet does not abandon his ways and watch over his soul lest he be veiled from Him to the extent of an atom, and on the Day of Resurrection He Whom God shall make manifest does not say "I am pleased with thee," all his deeds are nullified as though he had done nothing, for all that he did possessed no splendor.

Verily on the Day of Resurrection if He Whom God shall make manifest does not say "I am well-pleased with thee," all one's deeds shall be rendered null, as though one had performed nothing, for they shall possess no glory. But prior to the Day of His Manifestation, let all observe carefully the precepts of the Bayan. For thou desirest that He Who beholdeth thee should be pleased with thee - He Who knoweth thee while thou knowest Him not. Therefore be not veiled by anything from what hath been revealed in the Bayan, for the eye of divine good-pleasure hath ever been extended towards such creation.The Day of Resurrection is with the creation, but with God all conditions are as one condition. The Primal Reality seeth each and what they have earned, and is pleased with those who follow His commandments in the Bayan and are not veiled by anything before recognizing Him. For the first recognition is on that Day of Resurrection, whereupon thou must acquire the glory of all thy deeds, for that is but a single word. Look not at that word merely, for within it is everything. For instance, if on that Day thou wert to possess all things but didst not acquire the glory of thine existence through that word, judgment would be passed upon thee and all thou possessest in favor of one with whom God is pleased, for in thy existence no fruit would remain after being veiled from His glory - how much more so with what thou possessest!Therefore, observe the greatness of that word, for whether its decree becomes manifest or not, it stands at the same exalted level. All this is that thou mayest turn to the glory of all thy deeds and be among the saved ones on the Day of Resurrection. This is like two men who desire to trade - one toils from the beginning of his life until its end to acquire what he loves, while the other remains in his house and God sends down to him what he loves. This is like the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest - one strives diligently in the Bayan to attain God's good-pleasure, while at the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if one is sincere in his deeds to attain God's good-pleasure but recognizes Him at His appearance without having known anything and wins His good-pleasure - their glory is equal at the time of the Manifestation and before it with Him. But among creation, undoubtedly one who has strived and acquired all knowledge to attain God's good-pleasure is more honored than others, though before God they are equal, for He, glorified be His praise, looks to the glory of each thing and not to its multiplicity. This is of God's grace unto the worlds.The Eighth Gate of the First Unity from the Ninth Day of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Most Sublime," which has four ranks. The first, regarding the first letter: In the Name of God, the Most Sublime, the Most Sublime. God - there is no God but He, the Most Sublime, the Most Sublime. Say: God is more sublime than every possessor of sublimity. None in the heavens or the earth or what lies between them can escape from the dominion of His sublime sovereignty. Verily He is the All-Sublime, the Most Sublime, the Magnificent. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth, and unto God do all return. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and what lies between them by His command "Be!" and it is. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation \[...\]

Between them through His command "Be!" and it is. Say: He is the All-Conquering over His creation and the All-Manifest above His servants, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belongeth whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and unto God shall all return. Say: Whatever God willeth; there is no power except through God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Such is God, your Lord - His is the creation and the command; there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. He is the One Who createth whatsoever He willeth through His command "Be!" and it is. His is whatsoever dwelleth in the night and the day, and unto God shall all return. Say: He is the All-Conquering over His creation and the All-Manifest above His servants, and verily He is the Single One, the Inaccessible, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him, for this is a straight path. Hesitate not in what ye read, for God shall verily cause the letters to emerge from their places - why do ye not fear? Work ye such deeds as will save you on the Day of Resurrection, for this is what will profit you with God. Say: Verily we believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Watch ye over these words of yours, for ye do understand, yet on that Day ye shall not fulfill what ye say unless God willeth it for you - do ye not see? How many servants awaited in the Gospel the appearance of Ahmad, then when He came to them with guidance and clear proofs, they are still waiting unto this hour! And how many servants awaited in the Furqan what was promised them aforetime by Muhammad, the Apostle of God - and He came with guidance and clear proofs that rendered all the worlds powerless - yet unto this hour all are sleeping, save those who followed the Truth and are certain of God's signs. Make ye these two Manifestations the focus of your eyes, that perchance on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest ye may believe in Him and be certain of God's signs. Otherwise your deeds shall be rendered void as though ye had done nothing. Have mercy upon yourselves and show mercy. Say: God hath created the name of Glory for Himself that ye may be glorified on the Day of Resurrection. Say: God is not mentioned except there is remembered before Him how ye speak when ye mention the name of God - exalted be His glory - in the Book of God. Will ye not prostrate yourselves before God? Those who are glorified by the glory of their Lord - these are they who in the Book of God are called "the glorified ones." Whosoever mentioneth God by that Name, God will exalt him and clothe him in garments of glory from His presence - all who spend of His gift. Verily ye look unto the Essence of Glory. For on that Day, all that your knowledge encompasses regarding the glory of your religion hath previously been made manifest through the word of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, that ye might see all of that now in His utterance, and thus do ye look unto the splendor of the Cause. Otherwise ye have not understood aught of the exaltation of God's Cause, and your understanding of God's Cause is only according to what appeareth in the kingdom - why do ye not comprehend? All that ye observe of the glory of the House, with seventy thousand circumambulating around it - all of that was created beforehand through His word, when He ordained that should those upon earth circumambulate around it - in His word ye look unto the exaltation of the Cause. And if ye observe the elevation of places that have been raised above the earth - all of that, according to Muhammad's word, containeth of God's glory higher than what ye observe, for were places to be raised above this, verily its essence in that Cause \[...\]

And if you behold from the height of a place that hath been raised above the earth, all that is seen at the utterance of Muhammad wherein is the glory of God is more exalted than what you behold. For if that place be raised higher still, its essence would remain in that same matter, but you are servants who comprehend not. Magnify the Cause of God according to what appeareth before you, else whoso looketh upon the glory of God seeth in His Word all glory - do you not perceive? By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest, I behold glory in whoso is upon the earth according to what you reckon. Let not the one who hath believed in God be veiled by the veils of creation nor by that which riseth not above the earth - this is the essence of the matter, if you behold the splendor of all things. And verily this, when it hath not been manifested, ye are not able to comprehend. But look ye to what hath appeared before, for the glory of what existeth upon the earth according to what ye discuss - how will it be on that Day in your sight? And verily on that Day, were it to be like that, then ye would be beholding the splendor of the Cause. Otherwise, what ye know of glory is the glory of gold, not the glory of one who is slain in the path of God. What aileth you that ye understand not and comprehend not? And if ye behold Him Whom God shall make manifest seated upon a throne with all who are on earth prostrating before Him, how would the transcendence of God's glory appear in your eyes? Similarly on the Day when He shall be alone, if naught changeth you, then ye are looking upon the glory of God. Otherwise, according to what changeth you, associate not anything with God, your Lord, if ye are of those who are certain. For that is according to what is possible, and were God to create the like of what is on earth until it cannot be counted, and make them all exalted, and all to prostrate before Him, verily He is worthy of it, and before His glory all these would be humbled. And if ye were to recognize the glory of God like this and then fulfill it, then ye would be beholding the glory of God. Otherwise, the splendor of your glory is according to what ye comprehend, for ye humble yourselves before this. For whoso magnifieth Him after seeing nineteen ones before Him, and likewise did not magnify Him before seeing one before Him - such a one hath not truly magnified Him, but hath magnified other than Him. This is what God hath counseled you, for this is of that which ye associate, if ye be of those who acknowledge. For if ye glorify Him according to what His own Self deserveth, how would the number of the one in the one change you, or similarly were it to be one? This is the pure religion of God which all are commanded to follow. And God hath created nothing in the sight of Him Whom God shall make manifest more remote than one who changeth his attitude toward Him, for such a one hath associated with Him in that station whence he perceiveth not. All have been created to magnify Him according to what His own Self deserveth, for all things were created for Him within their own limits - do ye not see? And verily those who are able on the Day of Resurrection to pass over this path, these are they who are the unitarians.

But you have made His seat of glory a seat of abasement in your estimation, though your own selves would not be content with this, and the glory of God will never change in the sight of those who believe in Him and in Whom you profess belief. Verily a ruby, if it be with another ruby, is still a ruby, and if it be placed with a stone, it remaineth a ruby unchanged in its beauty in the sight of those who recognize it. And whosoever deemeth it otherwise hath not truly known it, else would he not have so judged. Thus doth God set forth similitudes and reveal the Supreme Similitude which hath no equal even unto the utmost limit of singularity, that ye may understand. Otherwise, glorified be God above this! How can that which is beneath God be mentioned in His presence when all before His glory are prostrate? Verily glory itself prostrateth before Him by night and by day and is among the humble ones. Therefore in all things look to the Essence of essences and the Beauty of all beauty, if ye be able to comprehend. For that is none other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who will speak to you the two words whereby ye shall comprehend all beauty. Say what was revealed aforetime: that there is no God but He, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, and that He is the One represented by the Seven Letters in the Bayan, Who ordaineth as He pleaseth from God's presence - there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And verily that which will make you recognize that Name in your midst, ye shall in that Day become certain through God's command, through that Name. Otherwise what is mentioned by His own most exalted Name is, in the sight of God and those who know Him, that Name of Him Who hath appeared from His latter manifestation. Therefore understand this and become certain through God's signs from His presence. Then observe on the day of His manifestation upon earth every glory, for verily He hath appeared through the manifestations before Him among the worlds. If all peoples were to recognize Him as their Prophet, how could they be detached from Him? That is a mention of God's glory on that Day, if ye comprehend. And verily He would not be content to appear under the name of any previous Prophet, rather all follow what is revealed from His presence and all act according to His command. Therefore observe the glory of Him Who hath appeared in the Bayan, that all may be detached unto Him. Thus have they found the Most Exalted Glory, and if they are veiled by anything, it behooveth not those who know God and His names to make mention of them. O servants of God, fear ye.The Second in the Second LetterIn the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify before Thee and before all things that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, and Thine the might and the sovereignty, and Thine the power and the dominion, and Thine the grandeur and the human realm, and Thine the might and the glory, and Thine the authority and justice, and Thine the countenance and beauty, and Thine the direction and perfection, and Thine the power and deeds, and Thine the likeness and similitudes, and Thine the might and invincibility, and Thine the loftiness and exaltation, and Thine the authority \[and radiance\]. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who perisheth not, and the Sovereign Who oppresseth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. I testify that before Thy glory all who possess glory are submissive and humble \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God, Who has exalted Himself through the sovereignty of His Self-Subsistence above all created things, and raised Himself through the sublimity of His holy dominion over all realities.I testify that before Thy majesty, all that is majestic boweth down in humility, and before Thy grandeur, all that is great standeth in reverent prostration. All things worship Thee through their essence, their reality, their soul and their being. Thine is the most glorious glory above all glory, and the most beauteous beauty above all beauty.How can I comprehend Thy majesty, O my God, when I behold Thy Beloved and see countless possessors of majesty in His shadow - those endowed with sovereignty, knowledge, loftiness and elevation? Yet all of this, before the majesty of Thy Beloved, is as naught, for He prostrateth Himself before Thee and worshippeth Thy Being. How then can I know Thy majesty or reckon Thy grandeur?Glorified art Thou! Glorified art Thou! To whom can the majesty of the Bayan be elevated, and to whose beauty can it visibly ascend among those possessed of sovereignty and knowledge? By Thy might! All who are invested with majesty are but as a tiny speck before the majesty of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. When all in the Bayan prostrate themselves before Him at His appearance, they will have fulfilled that which reduceth all their majesty to nothingness before His majesty.Thou didst not create the majesty of those in the Bayan except to show their lowliness before Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, for He is with Thee and within Thy grasp. How then can Thy majesty be reckoned or Thy beauty comprehended? All the majesty Thou didst create from the time of Adam until Muhammad was meant to be as naught before Thy Beloved, that His supreme majesty might be made manifest.All the majesty Thou didst create as Thy manifestation in Islam was intended solely that they might bow before Him Whom Thou wouldst make manifest on the Day of His appearance - Thy Qaim, Thy Proof, Thy Light, and Thy Word. By Thy might! I have seen no fruit of what Thou didst create except His paradise \[...\]

He hath risen with the sublimity of His Most Holy Sovereign Lordship above all essences, and is even as He hath ever been and shall forever be - the One God, Single, Self-Subsisting, Living, Self-Sustaining, the Ever-Enduring God. He hath taken unto Himself neither consort nor son. Verily He shall forever remain as He hath been - the Eternal Divine One, the Everlasting Lord, the Perpetual Sovereign, the Praiseworthy Master, the Manifest Subduer, the All-Knowing Judge, the One, the Single, the Self-Sustaining, the Supreme. All worship Him with the utmost elevation possible in creation through His grace, and all prostrate themselves with the highest reverence merited in existence from the fountainhead of His might. He hath called Himself and all His creation to witness that there is no God but Him - a testimony that filleth the heavens and their pillars with awe of Him, and the earth and all that glorify Him therein and thereon with reverence of Him, and the mountains and seas and whatsoever lieth concealed in the void and whatsoever is hidden between earth and heaven through the radiance that hath shone forth from the splendors of His might - a testimony that causeth the dwellers of the highest paradise to enter the heaven of His presence, and to abide upon the carpet of His knowledge and delight in His remembrance and names, the prostrators of His earth and His trusted ones.I testify that He hath ever been God and none is worshipped but Him, Lord and none is lorded over but Him, Sovereign and none is sovereign but Him, Creator and none is created but Him, Hearer and none is heard but Him. For the worshipped one remaineth ever within the bounds of creation, and his eternity within his limits shall never transcend nor be mentioned with the Most Ancient of Days. The lorded over remaineth ever within the bounds of invention, the one sovereign in all conditions within the limits of origination, the created one at all times among the manifestations of temporal things, and the heard one in all that is named a thing within the limits of that which taketh on existence through Glory. Glorified, glorified, glorified, glorified, glorified, glorified be He above all that the glorifiers have glorified, and above all that the sanctifiers have sanctified, and above all that the unitarians have unified, and above all that the magnifiers have magnified.Truly do they glorify Him who perceive His manifestation and exalt His Manifestation above all that beseemeth not His sublime bounty. They sanctify Him who know the Manifestation of His sanctification and follow the First One through the letters of His praise. They unify Him who declare His unity above all that beareth the name of a thing and are guided by the guidance of the letter of His unity on the day of His manifestation. They magnify Him who prostrate before Him on the day of His manifestation through the gates of His glorification. They extol Him who prostrate before Him through the merit of His Essence, though there be none possessed of majesty with Him, and after all possessed of majesty are joined with Him, this shall not change Him.These are atoms created all for His manifestation, and all are given existence in such wise that were they asked, they would be able to answer as all things are given existence - if one desireth to be given existence in truth like those given existence in Islam and those given existence therein have been given existence through the prophethood of Him Who manifested that religion through His manifestation with the verses which God hath sent down upon Him, and these are in the Qur'an. Upon this have all in Islam been created, and therefore were they asked "Am I not your Lord?" Then those who would answer Him are those who were given existence, all their religion, through the verses. "Yea!" None but God could send down His Gate, and verily We have been created upon that, that We might answer God concerning that for which He created us, or what We believed in our religion hath been established with us from the beginning of the manifestation of our religion, which is the manifestation of Muhammad through the verses which God hath sent down upon Him\[...\]

Verily We have been created to give answer unto God concerning that whereunto He hath created us and that wherein we have believed in our religion. From the beginning of the Manifestation of our religion, which is the Manifestation of Muhammad, it hath been established through the verses which God hath sent down unto Him, and we found no proof besides these verses. Thus shall we give answer unto God, even as Muhammad hath spoken aforetime, when they asked concerning the First Covenant. He spoke according to what they asked and they answered, or thus were they questioned before and gave answer unto God. And at that time God will question concerning all things, and those who have recognized Him and whose proof of religion hath been established through the verses of their Lord shall respond unto God. Then shall God question through the tongue of the Point of the Bayan, saying: "O all things! Am I not your God and your Lord Who hath created you, sustained you, caused you to die and given you life, that ye may respond on the Day when I make Myself known unto you?" And lo, the first to answer the Point of the Bayan shall say: "Yea, glory be unto Thee, O my God! There is none other God but Thee. Thou hast created me. Thou art my God and the God of all things. Verily Thou art my Lord and the Lord of all things. Verily Thou art my Creator and the Creator of all things. Verily Thou art my Sustainer and the Sustainer of all things. Verily Thou art He Who causeth me to die and Who causeth all things to die. Verily Thou art He Who giveth me life and Who giveth life to all things. Thou didst create me and all things according to the proof of the verses of the Qur'an, for the Day when Thou wouldst question me and all things, that I and all things might answer Thee. Lo, I have believed from aforetime that the Qur'an is Thy Book and Muhammad is Thy Messenger, and whatsoever He hath uttered is from Thee - that utterance concerning the guardianship of Thy martyrs, the proof of the lights of Thy glory, Thy chosen ones, and all that He hath spoken. Therefore shall I look to the essence of every proof before Thou createst the reality of revelation, and establishest the prophethood of the Prophet upon the word of glorification, and manifestest the expressions of reverence through the revelation of Thy Most Glorious Name, testifying that the verses which Thou hast sent down upon the Point of the Bayan are Thy verses and Thy words, and they are verily the verses of Thy Book, and they are more manifest in their manifestation, more exalted in their exaltation, more eloquent in their utterance, more impregnable in their impregnability, and more elevated in their elevation than the manifestation wherewith Thou didst manifest Thyself unto me aforetime. I take Thee and all Thy creation as witness that there is none other God but Thee, and all who are like unto me, were they to look upon that whereunto they have been created, would answer Thee when questioned that there is none other God but Thee, the Lord of all things and their Creator, the Sovereign of all things and their Ordainer, the King of all things and their Fashioner, the Originator of all things and their Quickener. Thine is the creation and the command, both before and after. There is none other God but Thee, the King, the Illuminator, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy, the Holy, the Most High. Then shall I testify that Thou didst take from the First Covenant the pledge of faith in Thee, in Thy verses, and in the Letters of the Unity from all Thy creation, that perchance the people might look unto this and, on the Day of Thy Later Manifestation, might glorify Thee and not be veiled by aught. Glory be unto Thee! There is none other God but Thee. Whosoever on the Day of Thy Manifestation looketh upon Thy proof, Thy words, Thy verses and Thy clear tokens, shall bear witness, and all things with him, that Thou art God, there is none other God but Thee, and shall glorify Thee before being questioned 'Am I not your Lord?' while uttering 'Yea, glory be unto Thee, there is none other God but Thee, my Lord and the Lord of all things. I have believed in Thee.'

O Lord of all things! I have believed in Thee and in Thy verses, and have followed the Letters of Unity according to Thy command. I have magnified what Thou hast magnified and abstained from what Thou hast forbidden, according to what was ordained by the Tongue of the Point of the Bayan. Upon this I die, live, am resurrected, gathered, and will present myself on the Day of Resurrection before Thee as one who knows Thee, prostrates before Thee, worships Thee, remembers Thee, is grateful to Thee, and patient in Thy path. There is no glory except in knowing Thee, and no exaltation except in Thy remembrance and praise.O God! Bestow Thy mercy upon all who are in the Bayan by answering them at the time of Thy Manifestation, for verily all on that day will be drowned in the sea of multiplicity and veiled from the primal Unity, save those whom Thou hast created for Thyself, chosen for Thy Cause, selected for Thy Revelation, accepted for Thy good-pleasure, and singled out for Thy love. These are the essences of the Bayan and the splendor of all that Thou hast created aforetime through Thy verses. Perchance no one recognizes them, nor do they possess what others possess, nor can anyone comprehend the knowledge of Thy decrees.And all who have been martyred in that Resurrection, each from a land without name or wealth or such conditions as people pride themselves upon before Thee - O God, exalt those whom Thou hast chosen for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, that they may attain what Thou lovest and art pleased with, and the heights of what Thou willest and decreest. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the Last and the First.The Fourth in the Fourth Letter: In the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious! Praise be to God, the Lord of Might and Majesty, from all eternity, and what the knowledge of God encompasses of the sublimity of Glory and the exaltation of Beauty at all times, as befits the loftiness of His sanctity in the heights of independence and the summit of majesty. And verily the Glory from God is upon the Letters of Glory and those who glorify them in every condition with might and majesty.And after - O Manifestation of Glory in the Bayan! I counsel thee to look upon the splendor of all Beauty, Glory, Perfection, Deeds, Example, Grace, and Justice, for verily it is a single soul that none can comprehend on the day of its manifestation. Blessed art thou and whoever understands this. But if one cannot recognize His glory at the time of His manifestation, let him look upon the glory of those who are in the Bayan, for all have been kindled for the manifestation of His Point, and verily He in His latter manifestation is more exalted than His former manifestation.And verily on the day of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, thou shalt see in the Bayan as thou seest in the Furqan. How many glorify the glory of Islam through Muhammad, the Messenger of God - may God's blessings be upon Him and His family - can it be counted? Likewise on that day, the source of all glory of the Bayan is the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest in the temple of the Point of the Bayan. If anyone is veiled by His glory, how can this be permissible for him when He is from Him?And verily all that hath appeared in the Bayan, make its likeness as the likeness of one who comes to His workers from what He trades for them. Then on the day of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, He desires to take from all His workers what they possess, and verily what is in the Bayan are His rightful workers, and verily what is on all the earth are His workers, but without right. However, He desires not to take what they have except that He wishes to give them more than the first and more exalted, for God does not abrogate from any community except \[...\]

God does not abrogate a people except that He creates its like, and verily that is better than it. Therefore, look ye unto the Day of God's Manifestation, for all that ye possess of your lives and all that profiteth you of your possessions - ye must be as the trustees on earth and return unto their owner the deposits placed in your care. The Bayan is a trust with you - return it unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and His Letters. Were I to mention your stations, it would not be possible, for within you is majesty beyond counting, and beauty likewise, and perfection likewise, and all this is but a branch of your existence, and verily it is from Him. How much more so that which brancheth from you! Therefore, ye must believe in God if ye be among the people of religion. Verily He, the blessings of God be upon Him, taketh naught from you except that He giveth you better than it, and He shall make you His servants even as He made you in the Bayan, and likewise in the Furqan, and before that in the Gospel, and before that beyond counting. For on the day of His manifestation ye possess the majesty of sovereignty, the majesty of knowledge, and the majesty of wealth, each according to his measure. Beware lest ye be veiled, O most mighty ones, and withhold this from its Owner, for whatsoever can be designated by the name of a thing hath been created solely for Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is the essence of what ye possess, if ye desire to render your deeds unto God; otherwise, yours is what ye have - ye shall die and not be remembered. Let this word be distinguished, for its like on the Day of His Manifestation, when one of the divines of the Bayan possesseth majesty due to his knowledge of the Bayan, may perchance prevent him from attaining His presence. But the animal perceiveth not that his majesty hath withered through the appearance of his first manifestation, and verily He is more exalted in His latter manifestation than His former manifestation, such that He accepteth nothing from His former manifestation after He willeth to raise up and send down whatsoever He pleaseth, and likewise that which is above it and that which is below it. All that ye possess from Him is for the manifestation before Him, from your existence unto whatsoever its mention endeth with you. Be not veiled by anything from the meeting with God, lest your deeds be rendered void while ye perceive it not. And likewise are all your conditions, if ye would reflect upon them and act according to them, then verily ye shall be saved on the Day of Resurrection. \[...\]

In the Name of God, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved! He is the One Who creates what He desires through His command "Be!" and it is. He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and unto Him shall all return. Say: All derive their might from God's might, for all might in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them belongs to God. Do you not see? Verily, might belongs to the Primal One and to whoso believes in God and His signs and is numbered among the devout. Say: All might belongs to Him Whom God shall make manifest - do you not desire to attain unto might? And then to whoso believes in Him. Thus did God create might for Him before the creation of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them. Do you not perceive? Should He take His seat upon the dust alone, all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them would prostrate before Him, whether they recognize Him or not, for all who prostrate in the Bayan prostrate only as commanded by the Primal Point for the glory of the Ultimate Point; thus are all submissive unto God. That Mirror reflects naught but God, and the letters of His Self are guides unto Him - all are created by His Word, all derive might from His might, all derive majesty from God's majesty. God has created no name mightier than this whereby you derive your might, for all who are mighty are mighty through His might. Do you not see? Look in the Qur'an and you will find all your might, for after God manifested Muhammad through His Self, likewise was the essence of might in His grasp. Do you not perceive? Verily the mightiest might belongs to Him Whom God shall make manifest, then to those nearest, then to those next nearest, until it reaches the minutest degree of might. Say: All derive their might from His might. And all in the Bayan, should they glorify Him on the Day of Resurrection, will have submitted to God and prostrated to His might; otherwise their deeds are rendered void and counted as naught in God's religion. Fear God, O people of might, on the Day of Resurrection, that you may prostrate before God's might. For the likeness of all earthly might compared to His might is as the suns in mirrors compared to the sun in heaven - all depend upon it. Likewise do all names depend upon God's Name, and all seek guidance from God their Lord. When God describes Himself with might, He creates the Manifestation of that Name, and similarly all names. Before being described, none can comprehend His might save Him, nor what He describes Himself with besides Him. Thus does God teach you in the Book that you may remember. Say: All prostrate before God's might. Say: All are devoted to God's might. Say: All are humble before God's might. Say: All are submissive to God's might. Say: Such is God's might that were the veil to be lifted from all on earth, they would all, from their mightiest sovereign to their lowliest subject, submit before Him as befits His station, whether they exalt themselves or not, for He alone merits might. This is God's command, that on the Day of Resurrection you may not look to outward forms. For one who knows God and believes in guidance on the Day of Resurrection is mightier before God - even if possessing nothing - than one who possesses all things. Therefore fear God, for that is the might of the Book before God, could you but comprehend it.

And if one hath naught, it is as though he hath all things if he feareth God. Indeed, this is the glory of the Book with God, did ye but understand. God shall raise up servants in the Bayan who shall make mention of every name that is mentioned in a book, in such elegant ways as can be expressed. This shall be among the most glorious of books in the sight of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore prepare yourselves for the day of meeting with Him, that ye may be rewarded. Verily, the most glorious of creatures in the sight of God are they who comprehend the knowledge of the Bayan; all else are but shadows beneath its shade. God shall cause to descend upon such a one that which distinguisheth all things, would ye but be assured. Unto God belong the most exalted similitudes in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved.The first name that was established as the name of the Identity after negation on the Day of Resurrection - that is the Name. Will ye not remember? This is God, your Lord. His are the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus was it formed in its essence. Thus doth God teach you the knowledge of the Book that ye may be God-fearing.Verily on the Day of Resurrection, every name that He Whom God shall make manifest reciteth according to its nature - that is the nearest of names. Do ye not desire to call upon God thereby, that ye may respond? God verily createth one of the names even as He createth your essences, but that whereby God is described cannot be created. He is your Creator and your Provider, He causeth you to die and giveth you life, and He shall raise you up. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: In the sight of all save God, the most glorious thing is every thing, but in God's creation, the glory of God is he whom He shall manifest. Do ye not desire to respond to him whom God hath glorified and who is more glorious than all things in His creation? How can one who grieveth him glorify God, his Lord? God verily loveth that he be glorified, exalted, made manifest, given dominion, made to prevail, and made victorious over all things through His word. He is indeed the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.Say: God is truth and all else beside God is creation. That is the ocean of the Divine Essence, but between the ocean of creation no third ocean shall be placed. Ye are assured of God and then His signs. Unto God belong the most exalted similitudes in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: That which hath been revealed concerning the ocean of the Divine Essence is like the mention of the Kaaba. Exalted is God above the mention of all things, for all things have been created by His command and cannot be mentioned without Him. Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe. The similitude of this is like unto the Kaaba, the House of God - that Word unto itself is its glory from its Lord, that ye may glorify Him on the Day of Resurrection. Ye glorify the House because it is attributed to God, how then do ye not glorify God and him whom He hath created the House through His word? What aileth you that ye understand not?Ye pray and prostrate yourselves before God for it, as God hath commanded you, how then do ye not prostrate yourselves before God on the Day of Resurrection? The example of this command is that if He willeth, the Manifestation of His Self could utter a thousand utterances in every moment - what aileth you that ye understand not? By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest, verily nine times nineteen minutes of the Day of Resurrection are better than the entire night, for the entire night in its length circumambulates around what hath been ordained for the Day of Resurrection.

I swear by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest that ninety-nine minutes of the Day of Resurrection are better than all the night, for throughout its length the night revolves around what is ordained for the Day of Resurrection, even if it be but twenty-nine minutes thereof. Should God so wish, He would expound all your religion on that Day more swiftly than you could return to your own selves the knowledge of your own selves through what He Whom God shall make manifest mentions concerning all religion unto Me. Why then do you not perceive? Say: Such is the power of God's Word that it hath not been created from aught else. Behold then your night: were it not for what God hath created in religion, all who dwell on earth would neither move nor rest save as God causeth them to move or rest on the Day of Resurrection. Why then do you not remember? But God createth whatsoever He willeth through His command 'Be!' and it is. Verily the Mirror of God, He Whom God shall make manifest, createth through His Word whatsoever He commandeth you, and if ye truly desire the Truth, ye shall act upon His command in that very instant, for whatsoever was done before was done by His command, all according to what was ordained in His religion. Is there any Ordainer before the before, during the during, and after the after except Him? Say: Glory be to God! That is the Primal Point - all inscribe themselves as belonging to Him. Verily He hath caused Himself to be known through His own Self, and verily He causeth God to be known through His Essence, and all created things find their creation through His appearance on the Day of Resurrection, through what was ordained for His manifestation, if ye be of them that are certain. Perchance He will appear and ye will hear yet not remember, even as came to pass regarding Muhammad aforetime, then regarding Ali before Muhammad thereafter, and ye shall witness the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then shall ye be convinced.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most MightyGlory be unto Thee, O God! I and all things bear witness that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Grandeur, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Sovereignty and the Mortal Realm, Thine the Glory and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Might and the Justice, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Loftiness and the Transcendence, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Trial and the Detachment, Thine the Similitude and the Examples, Thine the Glory and the Exaltation, Thine the Gift and the Bounty, Thine the Inaccessibility and the Power, Thine the Guardianship and the Victory, Thine the Strength and the Triumph, Thine the Conquest and the Dominion. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Unique, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, and an everlasting God, Self-Dependent. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring. The heavens and all therein glorify Thee, the earth and all therein sanctify Thee, and whatsoever lieth between them magnify Thee. There is no God but Thee, the Sovereign, the Most Exalted. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Unique Who perisheth not, and the Just Who wrong not. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command and bringest into being what Thou desirest by Thy leave. Never hast Thou been obeyed save through Thy knowledge, and never hast Thou decreed save through Thy power. For were it not that Thou didst create that creation through Thy power, who could withhold himself from Thee? And were it not that Thou didst know, after Thy recognition, those sincere unto Thee, who could make himself known thereby unto Thee? All are from Thee and unto Thee. There is no God but Thee. I beseech Thee by the Bayan and what Thou hast revealed therein until the Day of Resurrection of Thy invincible Manifestations \[...\]

And whatsoever hath been revealed therein until the Day of Resurrection of Thy transcendent Manifestations, Thy mighty Words, Thy ancient proofs, Thy subtle verses, Thy exalted conditions, and Thy delicate transcendent signs. I beseech Thee to bless the Seven Letters, then the First Letters through dominion and the Kingdom, through might and omnipotence, through power and divinity, through strength and the ruby, through sovereignty and the human realm, through glory and majesty, then through the Countenance and beauty, then through the Face and perfection, then through mercy and bounty, then through authority and justice, then through similitude and parables, then through geometry and deeds, then through glory and transcendence, then through joy and gladness, then through power and exaltation, then through trial and detachment, then through grandeur and pride, then through ascendancy and might, then through whatsoever Thou lovest and approvest in the highest horizon unto the primal atom. And ordain all of this on the Day of Resurrection for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest, that nothing may exist before an hour that is Thine or after an hour that is not Thine, for all who are in the Bayan at the time of His manifestation are Thine alone - there is no God but Thee. If aught be His, verily it is Thine in the manifestation of Thy creation, and if it be not His, all connection is severed from it and it is attributed to what is other than Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy might, before which all the mighty have bowed down, all the great have feared, all the lofty have submitted, all of radiant countenance and glory have been cut off from all else, and all of authority and power have prostrated themselves - to cause all who are in the Bayan to return unto Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest on the Day of Resurrection through Thy word, Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy subsistence and Thy transcendence, lest what Thou hast planted in the lineage of Thy love for His Day should come to naught. For they are prostrate before Him that He may look upon the word of creation and judge them. And should the word of faith appear from any part, it shall profit none save those souls who have manifested it. Therefore, O my God, preserve what Thou hast planted in the hearts of them that love Thee, the spirits of them that are sanctified, the souls of them that profess Thy unity, and the bodies of them that magnify Thee, and whatsoever is related thereunto of Thy right hand and Thy bounty, then Thy generosity and Thy benevolence and Thy grace. For through Thee have I become independent of all else besides Thee, and through Thee have I become sufficient apart from all Thy creation. I have seen no glory save in the loftiness of Thy verses and the exaltation of Thy words, and my knowledge of them in the darkest night, and my detachment from all things on the Day of Resurrection through the manifestation of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest through Thy most evident light. For on that Day the Cause shall return to the Essence of essences. Naught shall profit me save the word of testimony that there is no God but Thee, and the word of Prophethood, as Thou lovest not that any should be mentioned for Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest and whatsoever proceedeth from Him of the conditions of divine authority (and love?) and the stations of command and prohibition in the paths of Truth. Therefore, O my God, bestow this upon me. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Mighty. Glorified be He Whom the heavens praise through their loftiness and the earth through its lowliness and whatsoever is between them through what He hath ordained therein, and the mountains through their elevation, and the seas through their waves, and the trees through their growth, and the leaves through their verdure, and the fruits through their ripeness, and the fish through their swimming, and the birds through their soaring and their ranks, and the pens through their being, and the tablets through their recording, and the ink through what floweth by leave of its Lord, and the words through what descendeth from the treasury of their mystery - all glorify God through what is in them and upon them and before them and after them and above them and beneath them and unto them and with them. Glorified and exalted be He above all that the contingent things have glorified or shall glorify. Glorified be He \[...\]

Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever the existent things have sanctified or may sanctify! Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever the created things have unified or may unify! Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever the atoms have multiplied or may multiply! Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever the essences have magnified or may magnify! Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever the individuated beings have glorified or may glorify! Glorified and exalted is He above whatsoever those in the kingdom of earth and heaven have thanked or may thank!He is the One, and all who declare His oneness are but what He hath created by His command, limited by His leave, ordained by His decree, fashioned by His sanction, and determined by His power. He is the All-Compelling, the Compeller, possessed of compelling force and grandeur. He is the Manifest, the Manifester, possessed of manifestation and might. He is the Helper, the One Who giveth victory, possessed of triumph and loftiness. He is the Illuminator, the Illumined, possessed of illumination and majesty. He is the Powerful, the Empowered, possessed of sovereignty and dominion. He is the Subjugator, the Subduer, possessed of subjugation and ascendancy. He is the Ordainer, the One Who determineth, possessed of determination and power.Exalted, supremely exalted is His transcendent glory above the ascent of the most elevated essences of the adorned ones, or the rising to His holy atmosphere of the ethereal substances of the manifested ones. He is the Being through the essence of His Own Self, the All-Knowing through the knowledge of His Own Reality, the All-Hearing through His Own hearing, the All-Seeing through His holy vision, and the Most Subtle through the subtlety of His Own identity.He hath created this creation from nothing by His power and hath deposited within the essences of every manifestation signs of the sovereignty of His oneness, that all may be guided in every dispensation to the truth that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Powerful Ordainer, the Sovereign Manifester, the Revelator. Until the creation reached \[...\]

Verily shall he behold the fruits of that which was planted in the first life. Blessed is he who, from the first day of the manifestation of the Bayan until the time of His ascension, shall each one manifest that which God hath bestowed upon him through the manifestation of the Primal Point in His first appearance before His last through the manifestation of His last after His first. These are they whose essential realities and deeds shall not be rendered void before their Lord, and these are the God-fearing. Upon them rest the blessings of God, their Lord, at all times when they are brought before Him.The Fourth in the FourthIn the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most MightyPraise be to God Who hath ever been mighty in the might of His sovereignty and exalted in the kingdom of His holiness and grandeur. He hath created the essence of might in the First Unity, and through it hath He strengthened the manifold numbers as He willeth, how He willeth, through what He willeth. He is the Self-Exalted, the Most High.Furthermore, bear thou witness that might by right and grandeur in independence beseemeth none save God, exalted and mighty be He. Whosoever draweth nigh unto Him through any of the manifestations of His nearness, he is the nearest in might besides Him. Observe then that whereby the mighty ones seek might, for this is the essence of knowledge and wisdom in every path that God hath established. The might of knowledge and wisdom belongeth to none save God, exalted be His glory. Look thou therefore upon the earth - is thy knowledge on that Day according to what God hath ordained in the Bayan for thy might by right, even were it at the utmost perfection? Nay, thou art not before God and before him who knoweth Him, for might on that Day is cut off from all save God, and no thing's thingness is manifest for God except that it be for the Manifestation of His Self on the Day of Resurrection.All that is seen in the manifestations of might are partial manifestations in the kingdom, all of which have derived their might from the Sun of Reality and the Divine, Impregnable, Pre-existent Manifestation. That which profiteth thee in the night is might through pure truth. If thou art mighty before God and before him whom He desireth, even wert thou alone, without that thy might would not be by right. After the limit of night hath passed, then all thy might through thy knowledge of the Essence of Might and the Repository of Grandeur, the Point of Reality, is the same whether thou findest it in the heights of might or in the loftiness of unity. For its might at its manifestation through itself setteth not, and if one seeketh might through it without it, then he hath not known its truth and hath not upheld the right of its might. Rather, he hath sought might apart from it, and this is cut off in the estimation of the unitarians and forbidden by the mystics.For all the partial might thou findest in the kingdom is but a drop from the ocean of His might. Look at all who are on earth - each one seeketh might through attributing himself to something of his Lord's good-pleasure. Yet all attributions on that Day are true might except attribution to Him, and all good-pleasure after His manifestation is pleasing might except for him who is in His good-pleasure. They are veiled by partial manifestations from the Universal Essence, and all might thou findest with one possessed of might is from the ocean of His might, if it be true; and if it be not so, then that \[...\] is not attributed to Him nor doth He love it. This is the source of all might and the highest of all heights. Take shelter in the shadow of might that hath no abasement with it in all eternity, for this is the might of the Point of Reality in every manifestation.

And above all loftiness, seek shelter in the shadow of a glory that hath never been accompanied by abasement throughout all eternity. For this is the glory of the Point of Truth in every Manifestation. Cut thyself off from all glory through humility before It, for all who remain veiled are veiled only by the glory they possess from a previous Manifestation, whereby that partial nature remaineth veiled from the universal oceans. If thou wishest to discover Its glory, then consider: were all on earth to recognize Him, how they would humble themselves before Him, acknowledging His inherent worthiness and transcendent reality - though He Himself is submissive before God and humble before His glory. For there is no glory except through humility and submission before God, exalted be His glory, O Most Beautiful of the beautiful! And no grandeur except through yielding and humbleness before God, exalted be His might! Since the Divine Essence is sanctified and exalted above the mention of aught else, when one attaineth unto the Point of Truth, one hath attained unto Him. Then whosoever belongeth to It is from the manifestation of Its revelation until the completion of the First Unity, and the multiplication of that which none can reckon. Glorify all creation of God, yet see not creation except in the Bayan, for the spirit of humanity is therein and not elsewhere. This is from the glory of the Point to the first moment of Manifestation. Therefore, glorify nothing, not even thyself, unless thou findest it believing in Him Whom God shall make manifest. For God hath created glory only for submission to Him, and grandeur only for humbleness before Him. Whoso remaineth veiled from Him hath no worth before God, even to be mentioned. Therefore seek glory through God, for all glory belongeth to God, and all shall return unto God their Lord.The tenth chapter of the first Unity, concerning the tenth day of the year, regarding the knowledge of the Name "The Beautiful," which hath four stations. The first of the first:In the Name of God, the Most Beautiful, the Most Beautiful. God, there is no God but He, the Most Beautiful, the Most Beautiful. Say: God is more beautiful than every possessor of beauty. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can withhold himself from the dominion of His beauty's sovereignty. Verily, He hath ever been the Beautifier, the Beautiful, the Comely. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, and verily unto God do all return. He it is Whom glorify all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and verily unto Him do all turn. He is the Subduer over His creation, the Self-Subsisting, the Supreme. He is the Manifest over His servants, the Mighty, the Beloved. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them by His command. Lo! His is the creation and the command, before and after. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Every beauty that God can bring into being from the manifestations of affirmation, through it ye gaze upon God your Lord. And whoso believeth in the First Unity hath verily fashioned his heart, spirit, soul and body in the image of man, and whatsoever is below that is beneath the most exalted form. Will ye not see? And verily what ye perceive of your forms is beneath the forms of your bodies, souls, spirits and hearts. Were the forms of any of God's signs to appear in your forms, then would ye all be drawn \[...\]

And were the forms of any of God's signs to be manifested in your forms and hearts, then would ye all be drawn unto them, and according to what hath appeared in your temples of that which was created of the Beauty of the Point - do ye not behold? Beauty hath been cut off, and all that can be attributed to glory and perfection, from every possessor of remembrance except for those who enter into the Bayan, for all the forms of beauty that ye find upon the earth have been endowed by the Primal Point in the days ordained for its manifestation, and all these have been cut off save what was endowed in the Bayan - thus do all return unto Him. All the beauty that ye love is in the Bayan, for naught else exists in the Most Glorious Temple - do ye not perceive? And verily nothing else exists in form except in human form - do ye not see? And if ye desire to know the Beauty of God, then look ye unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, for then shall ye comprehend all beauty through His verses. And God hath not created His beauty save for those who believe in Him on the day of His manifestation, then for those whom He commandeth, for on that day the human forms shall be cut off from those who are in the Bayan, and none shall possess beauty except they believe in Him. Therefore fear ye God that ye may not flee on that day. And if beauty were as ye behold it, then ye would find this upon the earth - and how do ye not see it as animal? Nay, your souls desire not to be cut off unto it, for within it exists not the form of the One in Whom is the Beauty of God through which God hath manifested His Self. Say: O servants of God, fear ye Me! And God shall create in the Bayan manifestations of all His names, each one having no equal, no peer, no likeness, no partner, and no similitude - this is what hath been created from the manifestation of the Point, through which ye all comprehend every excellence. Therefore be ye cut off unto that Beauty which cutteth off from every possessor of beauty who believeth not in His beauty, for this is the Beauty of God by which all are drawn. Do ye not see how every possessor of beauty is cut off unto the Primal Point and what He hath commanded? This is what hath been ordained in the beauty of His Cause - do ye not perceive? And verily all that ye love in the Bayan is from the beauty of His Cause, wherein He hath commanded you - how then do ye comprehend the beauty of His Self, which indicateth naught but God, his Lord? Say: Glorified be God and exalted above all that ye comprehend! When God desired to create beauty, He said unto it: 'Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.' Then did He fashion it in the garments of beauty in such wise that were all the worlds to gaze upon it, their spirits would be severed from their bodies. Thus doth God create what He willeth - verily He is the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Therefore behold ye everything at the height of its beauty, for God loveth that all should attain unto the summit of His bounty - verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved. And verily that which falleth short of that crimson thread, that falleth short of His beauty.

All praise be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things testify, that Thou art God, and there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the grandeur, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the majesty and glory, Thine the loftiness and exaltation, Thine the sublimity and detachment, Thine the greatness and majesty, Thine the dominion and magnificence, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the awe and justice, Thine the exemplars and parables, Thine the power and perfection, and Thine are the most beautiful names. All that dwell in the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify Thee according to Thy reality, and all that abide in the realms of command and creation and whatsoever is beneath them sanctify Thee according to Thine essence. All things proclaim Thy unity according to Thy camphor-like purity, and all things magnify and extol Thee according to Thy transcendent nature. All things glorify Thee according to Thy grandeur, and all things prostrate before Thee according to the sovereignty of Thy dominion. All things are severed from all else save Thee according to the power of Thy radiant might. Thou art He Who hath clothed all things according to their capacity to receive Thy revelation of beauty, and through this they adorn themselves, both in their own estimation and in the eyes of all things, through Thy bounty alone. Nothing existeth save through Thee, the One besides Whom there is no God. Nothing is there, O my God, that doth not bow in adoration before Thy greatness according to the path Thou hast ordained for it, and that is not humbled before Thy Self-Subsistence according to the attributes wherewith Thou hast revealed Thyself unto it. On that Day all shall be cut off from all save those who recognize Thee through the Bayan and bear witness unto Thee through the divine Point according to what Thou hast revealed unto them in the heights of existence. Who is able, O my God, to comprehend the beauty of Thy countenance or the splendor of the holy manifestations of Thy Self-Subsistence? Verily, I behold within Thy dominion all those endued with beauty prostrating themselves before the gate of but one of those whom Thou hast mentioned, and turning in devotion unto him whom Thou hast raised up as Thy proof. By Thy might! I bear witness, as do all things, that were the veil to be removed from the eyes of all upon the earth, they would assuredly turn with devotion unto him whom Thou shalt make manifest as the source of Thy majesty and the dawning-place of Thy beauty, for Thou hast created none like unto him before him, nor shall any authority be seen after him. All that resideth within his heart is manifest and present through Thy love and knowledge, not according to what beseemeth Thyself or what Thy Being deserveth, for Thou hast ordained the treasuries of all things within their bounds, and hast made reality the treasury of Thy love and knowledge, and the repository of Thy affection and glorification, wherein naught can be seen except Thee. I beseech Thee by the beauty of Him Whom Thou hast created, by virtue of Whose manifestation all that are possessed of beauty must needs turn unto Him in accordance with His right \[...\]

I ask Thee by the Beauty which Thou hast created - whereby all beauty at the time of its appearance must needs be drawn unto it by virtue of its merit, and must needs be severed from whatsoever they possess in favor of that which it possesseth, by reason of its exaltation, its sublimity, its majesty, its beauty and its perfection - to send down, O my God, upon it and upon the Letters of the Living, then upon all the letters of its names and its likenesses, that which Thou didst send down of all Thy goodness upon the First Unity in the Bayan and upon them that resembled that Unity wherein naught can be seen except Him Who is manifest through Thy Manifestation and hidden through Thy concealment - Thy Most Exalted Name and Thy Most Luminous and Most Splendid Remembrance. For I, O my God, have believed in Thee, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, the One, the Single, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal, the Independent. Thou hast no equal, nor any peer, nor any likeness, nor any partner, nor any similitude. Sanctified be Thy name and exalted be Thy examples. And I believe in what Thou hast sent down upon the Tree of Thy love of Thy verses and Thy words, and in what Thou hast made the station of Thy Manifestation in the worlds of Thy creation and Thy command, and in what the Letters of the Living have indicated, and all who have no reality except His reality, for verily it is the essence like unto His might and the essence of might unto His Word.I beseech Thee, O God, to send down at this moment upon me, upon the Tree of Thy love, its root, its branch, its twigs, its leaves and its fruits that which befitteth the sublimity of Thy generosity, the exaltation of Thy grace, the elevation of Thy bounty, the inaccessibility of Thy favor, and the independence of Thy mercy in the kingdom of Thy command and creation, and that which befitteth the sublimity of Thy sovereignty and the exaltation of Thy power. For Thou art the Subduer of all things, the Sovereign over all things, the Inaccessible above the height of all things, the Most Exalted above the elevation of all things, and the Manifest above the manifestation of all things. Thou hast exalted Thyself above all things, made Thyself inaccessible to all things, manifested Thyself above all things, risen above all things, and demonstrated Thy power over whatsoever Thou hast created or wilt create by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third in the Third: In the Name of God, the Most Beautiful, the Most Beautiful. Praise be to God Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them through the effulgences of the lights of His Countenance of Self-Subsistence, then before the Throne upon the water through the glances of the lights of the faces of the Sun of the garment of His Beauty, that all things might attain unto the presence of His face on the Day of His Manifestation, for that is the ultimate goal for all from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end. And He hath ordained for all things therefrom a state and an ascent unto Him, that they might achieve His good-pleasure on the Day of His Manifestation, that they might meet Him in obedience to what is with Him and what He hath ordained for them from the treasuries of His Command and His Mystery. He hath called all His creation to witness that there is no God but Him. He was the Knower of all things before their existence and after their existence, Powerful over all things before their formation and after their formation, Mighty over all things before their designation and after their designation, Exalted above all things before their essence and after their essence, Inaccessible above the height of all things before their conception and after their conception. He is the One, the Single, the Alone, the Subduer, the Eternal, Who begetteth not, nor was begotten, and there is none like unto Him. He created that creation in the most exalted manner possible from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hath no end.

And there is none like unto Him. He hath created that creation in the most exalted manner possible from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end. And He desired not from their creation, nor from their sustenance, nor from their death, nor from their life, nor from their resurrection, save that they should glorify Him and sanctify Him and testify to His oneness and render thanks unto Him and magnify Him and exalt Him over all that He hath brought into being by His command and caused to exist by His word, though He was self-sufficient in the eternity of eternities above all His creation and independent, and will ever be, of all His servants. For this is the fruit of their existence - that they should know their Creator and Sustainer and the One Who causeth them to die and giveth them life and Who will resurrect them, the like of Whom there is nothing, and He is exalted above all things. He is the All-Hearing, the Single, the All-Seeing, the Holy, the Subtle, the Illuminating, the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, the Most High Judge. All faces bow down before Him and all necks humble themselves before Him and all hearts tremble in fear of Him by what He hath cast into them. All things began by His command and all things return to His word, that they who see with clear vision may perceive as they began when they return unto Him on the Day of Resurrection. And He hath appointed for them the length of night, which with Him is from sunset until the first light of dawn, that they may find solace in His signs and be uplifted by His words and be perfected by His manifestations and turn toward that which pleaseth Him and be detached unto the exaltation of His Cause and His glory on the day of His appearance, lest any soul be veiled from the radiance of His countenance. How lofty is the excellence of His grace and bounty! If He had willed, He would not have granted them respite in the night. Who is able to still them, inasmuch as He hath ever been manifest above His throne? In every moment His creation knoweth the appearance of His Self through His signs. And this is naught but the perfection of His favors and the completion of His bounties, that the believers might repose upon the carpet of His grace and benevolence, and that they who testify to His oneness might find solace in the manifestations of His glory and bounty, lest anything be deprived of that for which it was created in terms of its faith in God and His signs on the day of His appearance. O all things! Verily ye have been created from a beginning that hath no beginning until this your day that ye might believe in God and His signs on the Day of Resurrection as before, yet ye have been veiled from the fruit of your existence. Therefore prepare yourselves for the Day of God's appearance once again, for that is a day awaited by them who are nigh unto God, and on that day shall the hearts of the sincere ones be healed in such wise that were anyone to have lived from the day that hath no beginning until the time of His appearance, and no thought entered his heart save the good-pleasure of God, and he believed in all His commandments and in His appearance in all His manifestations from the beginning that hath no beginning and from the time of Adam until then - at that moment all that he hath wrought would be as naught, for all that was for the sake of God's word "thou hast worked for Me and I am pleased with thee," and this is not possible except from Him Whom God shall make manifest, Who speaketh from God as He willeth whatsoever He willeth. Thus hath God created that creation for the Essence of Beauty in His countenance and the Pure Glory in His visage, and were they who know to recognize His appearance, each would be severed from his totality and the essence of all things in order to reach Him and attain unto His presence\[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Beautiful, the Most Beautiful!Praise be to God Who hath known His Own Self through His Self, and hath sanctified Himself above the mention of His creation through the transcendence of His exaltation, and hath risen above the heights of all things through the sublimity of His essence and His power. He is the One, not of number, and the Exalted One, too high to be described by any likeness or peer. He hath created the First One from naught and hath appointed for it letters from the numbers of that Name wherein naught can be seen save the Spirit of the One in the One, which indicateth naught but the One. Then did He reveal Himself through it unto all His creation, both that which He hath brought into being and that which He shall bring into being, that nothing might possess its own identity except in its indication of God, its Lord, that there is no God but Him. His are the most beautiful names. All that are in the heavens and all that are on earth and all that lie between them glorify Him, and verily there is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Most Exalted.Consider thou how the beauty of the Pillar of the Greatest Name proceedeth only from the beauty of the Pillar of Divine Unity, and the Unity only from the Praise, and the Praise only from the Glorification. Such is the beauty of the essences that shine forth from the Eternal Beauty that hath ever been and shall ever remain, lofty, transcendent, inaccessible and elevated. Verily, whatsoever thou perceivest of beauty in that Temple proceedeth from the beauty that hath shone forth from the light of the Morn of Eternity upon the temples of hearts, until the revelations of Truth have descended to the level of physical limitation.Therefore, when thou beholdest any beauty in the Bayan, it behooveth thee to attribute it to God, for it is of God and from God, ever abiding in its primal reality and divine countenance that shineth forth from His eternal essence. God indeed loveth to gather within each soul all perfection from His presence, all beauty from His bounty, all majesty from His grace, all deeds from His favor, and all justice from His command. However, this is within the limits set forth in the Bayan until the Day when He Whom God shall make manifest appeareth. On that Day, it beseemeth not that any praiseworthy attributes of those who are in the Bayan or beneath it be mentioned in His presence. Knowledge hath encompassed His vicinity, and all praiseworthy attributes and beloved similitudes in the Bayan seek shelter beneath the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Such as these are created for God, and any others are for aught else but God, for were they for God they would return unto Him.Therefore, shouldst thou attain unto that Day, thou shalt behold the Essence of Glory, yet pay no heed to His glory when thou art in His presence, but rather look to the supreme glory of His worthiness. Then wilt thou be a knower of glory, but should it occur to thy heart \[...\]

And if you recognize Him, you have indeed veiled yourself? After this, none deserves forgiveness from its Source, nor mercy from its Creator. Similarly, in beauty, if a being of unparalleled beauty in the Bayan were to be compared with Him Whom God shall make manifest, and you look upon that being for what you perceive in it, you have veiled yourself from the beauty of God, for the beauty which you see therein is but a reflection of the previous Manifestation, and that is created from the beauty of His Essence. Therefore, God's decree upon you is that you shall be expelled from the company of the unitarians unless you return unto God and be of the penitent. Likewise with all attributes and qualities such as wealth and glory, and all that is praiseworthy whether of God or His creation. Observe how precise and keen this path is, and commune with your soul in the dark of night, that on the Day of Resurrection you may be numbered among the unitarians and not be veiled by anything from God, your Lord, for He is the Protector of the God-fearing. This is the word of truth if you can walk therein, not what you find among creation. Thus are souls elevated to the supreme horizon and the most glorious heights, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection you may find deliverance. Similarly, what the Beauty revealed in the First Wahid: if you find a being of unmatched beauty on earth compared with the Last Letter, and you look upon it and are veiled by it, you have veiled yourself from the beauty of God, for this perfection was created by Him, and its essence is with Him and in His countenance. Thus must you comprehend all names and attributes if you desire to be among the unitarians. But verily the matter is difficult on the Day of Resurrection when you see all creation desiring to turn to one of the Letters of the First Wahid, and perhaps on that Day you will find that Letter recognized by none, just as it was on the previous Day of Resurrection. Yet if you have insight in your religion, you will not be veiled, whether all creation recognizes Him or not, for you look with proof at the Word of the Lord. He made the Wahid before the Wahid of the Day of Resurrection. That Word with God is manifested only by Him Whom God shall make manifest. How then do you find all the Words of God in the excellence of the Bayan, how do the doers pride themselves therein? If you find the excellence of the Word of Him Whom God shall make manifest to be higher than that, then you have indeed recognized the Cause of God, for what excellence you have seen in the Bayan will not be accepted on that Day. Rather, His Cause will be accepted however He speaks and wills, whether those in the Bayan at that time obey Him or some remain veiled. For the glory of God's Cause is in itself, not in the souls of creation. Thus how do you find today a command from among the commands of Muhammad, peace be upon Him, how all Muslims follow it and pride themselves over each other thereby? If on the Day of Resurrection you act upon the command of Him Whom God shall make manifest in like manner, and your solitude does not change you, then you are indeed among the victorious. Otherwise, what has been ordained for you by God when you entered the Bayan without insight, for what makes the Bayan the Bayan on that Day is with Him Whom God shall make manifest. Blessed are they who believe in Him from the beauty of that great Day - these are they who have been made victorious through the lights of His Cause.

Otherwise, that which hath been ordained for thee by God when thou didst enter the Bayan without insight, for that which maketh the Bayan to be the Bayan on that Day is only through Him Whom God shall make manifest. Blessed are they who believe in Him in the excellence of a mighty Day - they who have been aided by the lights of His Cause and illumined by the radiance of the dawning-places of His glory, and they who believed in the Bayan aforetime - these are they who fear God.The twenty-first chapter of the first Unity concerning the twenty-first day of the year, regarding the knowledge of the Name "The Most Great", which hath four stations. The first of the first: In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. God - there is no God but He, the Most Great, the Most Great. Say: God is greater than every possessor of greatness. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the sovereignty of His greatness. Verily, He is the All-Great, the Most Great, the Supreme. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them - we are all prostrate before Him. Glorified be He before Whom are devoutly obedient whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth - verily unto Him do all return. Glorified be He before Whom are devoutly obedient whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them - verily unto Him are all transformed.There is no majesty nor greatness save through submission and humility before God, exalted be His glory. And since the Divine Essence is sanctified and exalted above the reach of any thing's mention, then what reacheth the Primal Point reacheth Him, and then whoso belongeth to Her is from the manifestation of Her effulgence, except that the First Unity be completed and magnified beyond what any knowledge can encompass, and every creation of God be exalted.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. He is the One Who created all things by His command, and verily He is the Creator, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. He it is Who provideth you from the heaven of His mercy. Is not His the creation and the command, both first and last? There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And unto God prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth. Say: All are prostrate before Him. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Believe ye then in God Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command "Be!" and it is. And prostrate yourselves before God Who knoweth what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what lieth between them, and verily unto Him are all transformed. Say: God knoweth the measure of these verses, but people know not. These are verses which God sent down aforetime upon the Primal Tree, whereupon one swooneth away for God his Lord, and by them the earth is cleft asunder and the mountains move, submissive, and all creation, in the heights wherein it dwelleth, prostrateth before them. These are verses revealed aforetime over twenty-three years as ye find with you today, but God now revealeth as He willeth by His command. Is not His the creation and the command, both first and last? There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Most Holy. Say: The greatness of God is with Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye wish to show forth greatness. Say: All that ye comprehend of greatness is but a creation there.

And thereafter, there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Holy One. Say: The greatness of God is with Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye desire to magnify yourselves. Say: All that ye comprehend of greatness is but a creation there, and prostrateth itself before God, its Lord. How is it then that ye understand not? Say: When God desireth to exalt the mention of a name, He shall cause it to attain unto the ocean of greatness. Do ye not behold? We shall verily recompense you with a recompense that was deemed great in the Mother Book, and We shall verily grant unto whomsoever We will a mighty dominion. And likewise, were ye to reflect upon the creation of your own selves, ye would find all this with God, your Lord, and unto God do all return. There is no God but God. Say: All are His worshippers. Say: All bow down before Him. Say: All are submissive unto Him. Say: All are humble before Him. He it is Who determineth the measure of all things by His command. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Best-Beloved. Ye shall surely perceive the essence of greatness on the Day of Resurrection with God, for all shall return there. And whatsoever ye find of the mention of greatness in creation, that is what hath been created by God's command, but ye know not. God knoweth what He hath sent down from His presence, and in His grasp is the kingdom of all things. There is no God but Him, the Ever-Living, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Unto God belong all the most excellent names. All that are in the heavens and on earth glorify Him. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Say: God will relieve you of all your grief - will ye not then be thankful? Say: Whatever partial deed is in your grasp is as naught compared to what is with God - that which is with Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do ye not see? And verily the partial that is with you existeth only by virtue of what was sent down aforetime from His Primary Will, but ye know not. Whomsoever God exalteth, all creation cannot bring low, and God is supreme over His servants. He causeth to prevail whomsoever He willeth by His command. He is verily the Strong, the Powerful, the Mighty. And whomsoever God abaseth, creation cannot exalt, and God abaseth whomsoever He willeth among His servants. He is verily the Strong, the Powerful, the Loving. Whomsoever He Whom God shall make manifest exalteth, that is he whom God hath exalted through His word, and whomsoever He abaseth, that is he whom God hath abased. Therefore fear ye God on the Day of Resurrection that ye may be saved. And whomsoever He Whom God shall make manifest magnifieth, that one's essence hath indeed magnified his Lord, else all merely magnify according to their desires, and what their hands have wrought shall profit them not. God hath magnified him before his manifestation through His word, and whoso magnifieth him, God will exalt in the life to come and in the first life. He is verily the Most High, the Most Great. This is so that ye may call upon God by what hath been sent down in the Book of His most excellent names. His is the most sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. His is the most glorious similitude, transcending the most sublime, in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most GreatGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee.

And all things attest that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone without peer. Thine is the Kingdom and the heavenly dominion, Thine the might and the celestial realm, Thine the power and the divine realm, Thine the sovereignty and the human realm. Thine is might and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the vision and perfection, Thine mercy and bounty, Thine dominion and justice, Thine the likeness and the examples, Thine the station and glory, Thine victory and triumph, Thine exaltation and ascendancy, Thine honor and invincibility, Thine joy and gladness, Thine tribulation and detachment, Thine grandeur and pride. Thou hast been exalted through the sovereignty of Thy Self-Subsistence above all contingent things, and elevated through the dominion of Thy sanctified might above all created things. I shall praise Thee beyond all praise that contingent things have offered or shall offer unto Thee. I shall sanctify Thee beyond all sanctification that created things have rendered or shall render unto Thee. I shall unite Thee beyond all unity that entities have proclaimed or shall proclaim of Thee. I shall magnify Thee above all magnification that things have declared or shall declare of Thee. I shall glorify Thee beyond all glorification that beings have expressed or shall express toward Thee. I shall honor Thee above all honor that essences have shown or shall show unto Thee. And I shall thank Thee for all that Thou hast created or shalt create, as befitteth the sublimity of Thy sanctity and the exaltation of Thy glory. Thou art high above all loftiness and elevation, transcendent above all who possess sublimity and radiance, sanctified above all who possess might and invincibility, exalted above all who possess grandeur and ascendancy. Verily Thou art the Almighty above all who possess might and power. All who possess grandeur and pride have bowed before Thee, and all who possess awe and invincibility have humbled themselves before Thee. Thou art the Subduer Who cannot be subdued, the Vanquisher Who cannot be vanquished, the Manifest Who cannot be manifested, the Invincible Who cannot be resisted, the Exalted Who cannot be surpassed, the Omnipotent Who cannot be challenged, the Sovereign Who cannot be equaled. Forever have Thy creatures been Thy creatures, and the Command is from Thee and unto Thee, alone with no God but Thee. Therefore, O my God, shower down at this moment through Thy generosity and grace, through Thy bounty and kindness, Thy mercy and benevolence and beneficence, upon the Tree of Thy love and all that pertaineth unto it of every good thing which Thy knowledge encompasseth, and upon that which is beneath the Tree of Thy love that which \[...\] and shall leave no trace. Verily Thou art the Lord of the First and the Last. Thy power extendeth over all contingent things, Thy sovereignty prevaileth over all created things, Thy Self-Subsistence transcendeth all beings, Thy sanctity is exalted above all atoms, and Thy perpetuity is manifest and supreme over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. I testify that there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner, and that the First One is the first of Thy creation, and that His numbers are the manifestations of Thy Cause, and that those who resemble this are among the dwellers of Thy Paradise and the guides to Thy Self-Subsistence. Therefore, O God, assist Thy friends with all Thy assistance, enrich all Thy loved ones with all Thy riches, grant victory to all Thy chosen ones with all Thy triumph, elevate all Thy martyrs to the heights of Thy exaltation, and deliver through the sovereignty of Thy might and Thy Self-Subsistence all who are sorrowful from their sorrow \[...\] was Thine and unto Thee, alone with no God but Thee. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. Not an atom escapeth Thy knowledge in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them, and verily Thou encompasseth all things. The Third in the Third. In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all things through that whereby He hath brought them into being from naught at the manifestation of His revelation.

Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself unto all things through that which He hath created out of nothing at the manifestation of His revelation, and hath fashioned all things according to what He hath ordained therein of the manifestation of His Cause and the repository of His mystery, that they may testify at the time of the appearance of their Lord that there is none other God but Him, the Possessor of the greatest signs, the mightiest evidences, the most excellent proofs, the most exalted manifestations and the most glorious tokens, whereby all things bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He hath been exalted through the loftiness of what He hath created above all things, and elevated through the sublimity of what He hath brought into being above the height of all things. He is the Most High before all things in the loftiness of His exaltation, and He is the Enduring after the passing away of all things in the sublimity of His elevation. All things bear witness unto Him even as His Own Self hath borne witness unto His Own Self, and He is sanctified above the description of aught else through the loftiness of His essence, and hallowed above the attributes of all else through the sublimity of His Being. He is the Almighty Who hath ever been and ever shall be, and the Manifest above all things without measure or decline. He hath created all things through His Will, magnified them through His Purpose, established them through His Power, elevated them through His Decree, caused them to follow His Execution, subdued them through His Term, and given them dominion through His Book, through the might of His sovereign power and the exaltation of His glorious dominion.Then He chose from among His creation a Hidden Essence, a Treasured Purity, a Camphorated Glory, and made it the Sun of His Countenance, the Garment of His Face, the Reality of His Oneness, and the Object of His Eternal Self-Subsistence, and the Splendor of what hath shone forth and illumined, then risen and ascended from the horizon of His holy grace. He made it the Primal Point, the Most Exalted Paradise, the Most Glorious Summit, the Greatest Sign, and the Most Evident Countenance.Then He chose for it Luminous, Essential Letters, rising, shining, radiant, prophetic, indicative of the loftiness of their elevation, the sublimity of their exaltation, the height of their ascension, the inviolability of their protection, the joy of their gladness, the power of their might, and the victory of their triumph. He made them the Letters of the Living Being and the Guides of Glory in the Bayan.Then through it He created whatsoever He willed of creation and revealed Himself through it unto creation as He pleased. Thus were the heavens filled in the hearts of the exalted ones, and the earth in the realities of the great ones, and what lieth between them of air and water in the spirits of the holy ones and the souls of the unitarians, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Possessor of Glory and Sovereignty and Dominion, the Possessor of Might and Power, the Possessor of Strength and Splendor, the Possessor of Force and Divinity, the Possessor of Rule and Humanity, the Possessor of Power and Exaltation, the Possessor of Protection and Detachment, until the pillars of all things were filled with the loftiness of His elevation and glory, and the sublimity of His exaltation and splendor. Thereby have all the sincere ones ascended and all the veiled ones become enriched. In like manner shall all be tested on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Blessed are they who believe in Him and in what He shall utter by God's leave.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. Praise be to God, there is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting. Verily all glory from God be upon the First Unity Who pointeth to none save God, Who there is no God but He, the Guardian, the Holy \[...\]

Glory be unto God and upon the First Unity which indicateth naught but God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Supreme, the Most Holy. I shall impart unto thee the essence of utterance and the glory of that which shall profit thee in all matters. Verily, all majesty belongeth unto God and unto him who believeth in Him. And if majesty pertaineth to matters of learning and worldly affairs, then look upon the earth from east to west, and thou shalt find therein all manner of outward majesty. Yet before God - exalted be His majesty and His power - these have not the worth of an ant's wing, for true majesty belongeth to whoso recognizeth God in His wondrous Manifestation and believeth in God and His signs. All else abideth not beneath God's shadow.O Most Luminous of the luminous ones! How can majesty revert to aught else, even though all things at their creation were created for God and return unto Him? Yet in every new Manifestation, they who were created in a former Revelation become veiled. Verily, on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, all majesty shall be His and shall belong to whoso worshippeth God through Him, even if he be seated upon the earth with but one person before him. For in very truth all majesty belongeth unto Him. Therefore, whatsoever majesty thou findest in the Bayan was created for His previous Manifestation, that it might return unto Him. For it belongeth unto God, else it would perish in negation.If thou desirest faith, then look to the essence of majesty and its glory, else I shall not address thee with a word. God is the Protector of those who prostrate themselves, who bow down before Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of His appearance, and who behold all majesty and all attributes within His grasp, whether or not all that is on earth returneth unto Him. This is the essence of majesty and the pure glory for them that understand.Verily, the majesty, its glory and its essence are with Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then all mirrors that face that true Sun shall be characterized by its attributes according to the measure of its effulgence of majesty and might. God hath ordained the number of all things to be the letters of the Basmala in the name of the Unity. Should there emerge on the Day of Resurrection, which is the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the letters of Unity, that would be the glory of all things. And if all emerge, then blessed are they. And if not a single letter emergeth from the Bayan, that would be through God's grace upon all His creation.But look to the Day of Muhammad's Manifestation, for on that Day He was a mirror reflecting God, and all the Most Beautiful Names of God that were in the Gospel found their repository in none other than Ali. Nay, look to the Proof unto whom all proof returneth, if thou findest Him. Then He is thy companion and thy Lord. Hold fast to the Most Firm Handle that is with Him, for therein lieth all majesty, and all that ye behold was created through Him, and all subsist through Him \[...\]

He hath four stations. The first among the first:In the Name of God, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous! God, there is no God but Him, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous! Say: God is more luminous than every possessor of light. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can resist the sovereignty of His light. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Illuminating, the Light-Giving, the Resplendent. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth, and unto God shall all return. He it is Who createth what He willeth through His command "Be!" and it is. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and unto Him shall all be turned. He it is Who originateth what He willeth through His command, and by His command do all subsist. Say: He is the Knower of every soul, aware of what it hath earned and what it shall earn, and verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: He is independent of all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and all are created by His word. He it is Who created you by His command - will ye not then see? And He it is Who sustaineth you from heaven by His command - will ye not then be thankful? And He it is Who causeth you to die and then giveth you life by His command - will ye not then perceive? And He it is Who hath appointed for you in the Book the measures of all things, that ye might determine according to what He hath ordained. Say: He is the Subduer over His creation and the Manifest over His servants, and verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He is the Light above every possessor of light - all are guided by His light. Say: He is the Light before every possessor of light, and all bow down before Him. Say: He is the Light after every possessor of light, and all shall return unto Him. Say: He is the Light in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them - ye are guided by the signs of God. Say: God cannot be described by reference to light, for indeed every light is illumined by His command, and verily He is the Illuminating, the Beloved. He it is Who created you by His command, and verily there is no God but Him, the Gracious, the Beloved. Say: He is the Truth, there is no God but Him. He turneth you about by night and by day while ye behold Him. Say: God originateth you, then causeth you to return - will ye not then fear? Say: God originateth you in every Manifestation by His command, and verily God shall cause you to return after the first Manifestation by His word - will ye not then see how We originated you through the Furqan and shall cause you to return through the Bayan? Then We originated you therein once again, whereupon all shall arise, and the earth shall shine with the light of its Lord, and all shall be brought before God, their Lord. And when the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them are filled with the light of God, will ye not then be guided thereby? Look ye unto the numbers of the Illuminator, then shall ye testify through the guides that verily there is no God but Him - all shall enter Paradise through His light. And as for those who are not illumined by His light, these have no knowledge, nor do they know. Were they to know, they would surely turn unto God their Lord and would then be illumined by His light. Say: God is the light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. And the likeness of what He hath ordained of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp enclosed in glass, the glass as it were a glittering star, lit from a blessed tree by the leave of its Lord. Thus doth God set forth parables in the Book that ye may be assured of God's command. He causeth the night to pass into the day \[...\]

And verily the similitude of what hath been ordained of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp in crystal, crystal within crystal, lit by the leave of its Lord, as though it were a star in heaven within heaven. Thus doth God set forth parables in the Book that ye may attain certitude in the Cause of God. He causeth the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night, and He bringeth forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and He provideth whom He willeth through His grace. Verily He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Such is God, your Lord. His is the creation and the command. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: All that ye behold of every thing hath been created by the command of God. This is the command of Him Whom God shall make manifest in the temples of His Self before His manifestation, that ye may not be veiled from him who speaketh therein. For these temples from after Adam, then from the day of Adam until now, in every Manifestation speak from God their Lord that there is no God but Him - all are devoted unto Him. Unto God belong the most excellent similitudes in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All shall return unto God their Lord. And verily God extendeth all things through the Primal Point - can ye not see? All that beareth the name of anything in Islam God hath numbered unto Muhammad aforetime. Thus doth God create what He willeth. Then He hath numbered you in the Bayan through him upon whose breast the verses were sent down, who reciteth from God as He willeth. Is not His the creation and the command? There is no God but Him, the Great, the Most Exalted. Verily the martyrs are the light of God though no trace of self remaineth in them that would keep them from God their Lord, and verily what sustaineth them are their bodies which have been cut off for God. Thus doth God make mention of them through His light that ye may be guided by the light of God. Unto God belong the most excellent names, before and after. Say: All begin from God. Say: All return unto God. Say: All labor for God. Say: All are devoted unto God. Unto Him have submitted all who are in the heavens and the earth. Say: All shall be cut off from aught else but God their Lord.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art the Light of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and that Thou wert Light before all light and Light after all light and Light with all light and Light above all light. I beseech Thee by Thy light wherewith Thou hast illumined the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, that Thou wilt send down upon the Manifestations of Thy light that which beseemeth the loftiness of Thy holiness and the sublimity of Thy glory. For I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, and Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, and Thine the Power and Divinity, and Thine the Power and Glory, and Thine the Sovereignty and the Realm of Man. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing, neither in the heavens nor on the earth nor whatsoever is between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things. The seven heavens praise Thee \[...\]

The seven heavens and whatsoever is within them, and the earths and whatsoever is upon them, and whatsoever lieth between them and beneath them, all glorify Thee. All are Thy servants and within Thy grasp. Thou hast exalted Thyself through Thy might above all contingent beings, magnified Thyself through Thy grandeur above all creation, elevated Thyself through Thy greatness above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and raised Thyself through Thy loftiness above all created things. Through Thy sovereignty Thou hast subdued all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Thou art He Who hath illumined all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them through Thy light, and hast brought whomsoever Thou willest among Thy creation to their portion and their gathering. Thine is the most exalted transcendence above every transcendence and glory, and Thine is the most resplendent supremacy above every supremacy and splendor. O God, send down at this moment upon the Tree of Thy oneness and upon those who seek shelter beneath its shade that which befitteth the loftiness of Thy bounty, the sublimity of Thy grace, the exaltation of Thy generosity, the inaccessibility of Thy tenderness, and the expansiveness of Thy mercy. Verily, nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them escapeth Thy knowledge, and nothing in the kingdoms of Command or Creation or whatsoever lieth beneath them can frustrate Thee. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be unto Him Who created the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them through His light, and Who hath risen above every exalted one through His manifestation. All who dwell in the kingdom of His invisibility and visibility bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Lord of might and majesty, the Possessor of beauty and perfection, of grace and bounty, of power and justice, of mercy and generosity, of glory and grandeur, of sovereignty and dominion, of strength and action, of awesomeness and unfailing purpose. His are the most beautiful names, the most exalted attributes, the most glorious splendor, the most evident favors, the greatest trials, the mightiest signs, the ultimate revelations, and the most elevated manifestations. All faces bow before the sovereignty of His might, and all ages submit to the power of His Will. He hath ever been ancient in the eternity of eternities, and everlasting without measure or decline. He gazed upon the kingdom of His heaven and earth, then chose from among His servants those whom He found recognizing Him, free from the desires of their souls or the imaginings of their hearts. He revealed Himself to them through them and made them know Him as the One besides Whom there is no other God. This hath ever been His way in every manifestation - that whosoever desireth to meet Him and worship Him according to His good-pleasure shall not look with his eyes toward the hiding place of His invisibility and the loftiness of His Cause, nor shall he traverse the sea of vain imaginings, nor be veiled during the time of concealment by the radiance that shone forth from His previous manifestation. He ever desireth Him as He appeared before and awaiteth His meeting as He was revealed before. Exalted be God, the Sovereign King, the Supreme Judge, the One, the Single, the All-Glorious, above being comprehended in the outer aspects of His manifestations by the dwellers in His invisibility and His revelation. He hath chosen in that manifestation mirrors for Himself and revealed Himself to them through them by themselves, and made them the sun of His knowledge. Then He chose for it mirrors of glory extending to the Day of Resurrection wherein naught can be seen except Him.

He made it the sun of His knowledge, and then chose for it, from the mirrors of might, those that would be limitless until the Day of Resurrection, wherein naught is seen save Him, and none can indicate aught but Him. And if these mirrors match the mirrors of the First in their Last, then they are established; otherwise they are separated from that which is within them and raised from them in another manifestation. Let then the sincere ones seek Him, and let the mystics who are certain that God did not create them in vain draw nigh unto Him. Indeed, He created them that they might await the Day of His Manifestation and watch for the days of His concealment - that which He has ordained for them from His hidden treasuries and bestowed upon them from the affairs of His Cause. Then God and all His names bestow grace upon whoso is guided by His guidance in every manifestation, according to His bounty and exaltation. Verily, He is the All-Compelling, the Most Exalted.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Luminous, the Most Luminous. Praise be to God Who created light through light, then established Himself upon the throne of manifestation through what was revealed unto His Lord with the water from the fountain of camphor. Indeed, the glory from His presence is upon the repository of manifestation and upon the guides to His Self in the concourse of might and the unseen. And after thou hast known the water of life in a name, thou must know \[it in spirit\]. If thou learnest the words for themselves, thou art veiled from God's purpose in them; and if for their spirits, this is like the first case. But when thou regardest them as God wished thee to regard them, then thou art in God's good-pleasure as long as love endureth therein. Otherwise, on the Day of Resurrection thou wilt not be able to lift thy gaze from them and wilt be veiled by them, for thou didst not enter into them according to the essence of what God intended. Hadst thou done so, thou wouldst have been among the monotheists in His presence and among those who seek tidings in the shadow of His good-pleasure.Say: When I saw glory in knowing them, I learned them, and when I saw exaltation in believing in them, I bore them. Therefore look to thyself and to every soul, for the dwellers in the sea of reality are elevated above regarding anything besides God, and if they do regard anything, it is not for its own sake but for what God has deposited therein of His Cause. Thus on the Day of Resurrection, quicker than the twinkling of an eye, they detach themselves from what they possess and turn to God with what He possesses. Nothing veils them from meeting God, and nothing prevents them from Divine Unity after recognizing Him, nor from acknowledging His justice after His grace.If all the knowledge thou hast acquired and all that thou hast comprehended of matters unseen from the air of thy heart - if thou shouldst apply all of these to the Point of Reality on the day of His manifestation, then thou art truthful; otherwise thou hast worshipped God according to thy fancy and art as nothing before God. For example, thou sayest "O God, Thou art the Light." If thou findest the Manifestation of Reality to be light and no thought of the opposite of light, which is darkness, crosses thy mind, then thou art truthful. But if thou speakest through fancy, it profiteth thee not, for all creation speaketh such words innumerably, each according to what God has ordained in their religion. But when they are veiled from the seat of the Cause, which is the Manifestation of Reality, then it profiteth them not and is nullified as though they had neither acted nor spoken.Observe the limit of creation: without doubt man's human essence is more glorious and noble than what is below it. Therefore observe in the kingdom how one who possesseth that form glorieth in what is beneath him, each according to his station - one thou seest glorying in his possession of land \[...\]

Look upon the kingdom, and behold how he who occupies that temple is exalted by what is beneath him, each according to his station. One you see exalted by possession of land, another by possession of water, one by possession of trees, another by possession of jewels, some by possession of bounties, some by possession of animals, and some by possession of gold. Yet if you were to look into the inner reality, you would find them all veiled from true glory. If they knew their own worth, they would not seek exaltation through that which is beneath them, for they possess the human temple, while a piece of ruby is but mineral matter. See how one who stands at the human level seeks glory through it - this is because the light of reality has not shone within him. Otherwise, the lofty would never seek exaltation through the base. Therefore, the people of truth see creation in other than human form. He who seeks glory through rubies reveals himself to be lower than they, thus his temple becomes that of the lowest mineral. Look then upon creation - none possess the light of reality save those who seek glory through God alone, for their essence must be exalted through God, as the essence of the Tree of Reality is above them, like the sun reflected in mirrors. Similarly, you see each within his bounds - for example, one whose existence is at the second level, if he seeks glory through the first level, this comes from the light of reality within him. Otherwise, were he to seek glory through what is beneath him, how could the light of reality be in him? By Him Who splits the seed and creates the soul, I have found the light of reality in none save those who seek glory through God, for in them has shone the light of reality, and they deserve to be called human. Otherwise, look at people - their inner realities take the form of that through which they seek glory. Were the most high to shine forth... and you shall await the first and what lies between them and above them - praise that fills the pillars of all things with manifestations of His glorification, appears in all things through manifestations of His sanctification, rises above all things through signs of His oneness, transcends all things through attributes of His greatness, and shines above all things through the glorious lights of His countenance. Praise Him with praise unlike any offered by those before or after, praise that fills the heavens and earth and what lies between them with His generosity and grace, and brings all things to the ocean of His kindness and favor. Praise through which the sincere ones sail, which the God-fearing manifest, through which the believers ascend, by which the unitarians rise, and toward which the detached are drawn. Praise that multiplies the sun's radiance in its celestial height, then the light of the moon and stars in their rising and setting, brings forth from earth the blessings ordained therein, forms in the seas the pearls concealed within them, and causes trees to yield diverse fruits each reaching unprecedented heights. Praise such that when the wing of His mercy is spread, no sorrow remains in creation, and none behold Him save to detach themselves unto Him with their entire being, essence and reality \[...\]

All praise be to Him - praise that surpasseth every other praise and transcendeth all glory - praise that enableth every created thing to attain the summit of its existence through the bounty of its Creator, the grace of its Worshipped One, the favor of its Intended One, the bestowals of its Beloved, and His gifts. Praise unto which the counselors turn, and toward which all believers are drawn, leaving naught in the kingdom on high nor in the earth below nor in what lieth between them save that which worshippeth God thereby, maketh mention of Him, glorifieth Him, sanctifieth Him, magnifieth Him thereby, and is wholly devoted to Him. Praise that hath no equal, no peer, no likeness, no companion, and no similitude - before which every mighty one boweth down, every great one is humbled, every powerful one fleeth in fear, every virtuous one is awed by His justice, and every sovereign one is drawn to His grace, for less than this beseemeth not God, exalted be His glory, and naught else is worthy of His holy court, glorified be His majesty. His is the praise in what He pleaseth and beyond what He pleaseth, in what He loveth and counteth. Verily He is the Protector of whosoever praiseth Him or shall praise Him in the Hereafter and in the former times.The Fourth in the Fourth. In the Name of God, the Most Ancient of the Most Ancient. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Ancient of the Most Ancient. And verily the Glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon those who are the letters of His number or correspond to those numbers wherein naught can be seen except the Primal Unity. Know thou in that Pillar that every word hath an essential reality. For example, that Name hath manifestations with God - some are guides to its Qaf, some are guides to its Dal, some are guides to its Ya, some are guides to its Mim. Yet all are guides unto Him, that there is no God but He, the One God, Single, Unique, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling, Self-Dependent, Who begetteth not nor is begotten, and there is none like unto Him.That which thou hast known of Reality or shalt come to know - thou canst not find shelter therein, for Reality, O most perfect of the perfect ones, is the essence of all things, as God hath commanded all to know it. The fruit thereof is that nothing findeth its own essence except through it. The example of the manifestation of the Primal Reality in that creation is like the manifestation of Muhammad aforetime, wherein whoso knoweth Him seeth the reality of his own being as a form subsisting through Him, like the subsistence of what appeareth in mirrors through that which is reflected therein, even as Ali knew Him and was wholly devoted to Him, seeing naught of self.Then after that Manifestation, observe the Bayan, for all that thou hast learned of the manifestation of eternity and the dawning of pre-existence - all that is the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan in the temple of the Seven Letters. For whoso knoweth that He is the Reality, like the first to believe in Him, is wholly devoted to Him such that no essence remaineth to himself save through Him. For this is the fruit of knowing Reality, not mere forms of knowledge and words. For the example of Reality is as the sun - were it not to exist, nothing would exist in mirrors. Therefore be fair in God's name - had God not manifested Muhammad, the Sun of Reality, wouldst thou have any knowledge of God, or His Self, or the Imams, or the Goodly Leaf, or the Imams of Guidance, or anything of God's commands? Likewise all that was created in Islam consists of forms in the presence of the sun of His manifestation \[...\]

Speech is like unto the truth which may be likened to the sun - were it not to exist, nothing would appear in mirrors. Judge thou fairly: had God not manifested Muhammad, the Sun of Truth, wouldst thou possess any knowledge of God, or of His Self, or of the Imams, or of the goodly Leaf, or of the Imams of guidance, or of aught pertaining to God's commandments? Similarly, all that was brought into being in Islam was but shadows cast by the sun of His Revelation. And likewise in the Bayan. Consider how all that cometh into being in the Bayan are but shadows in mirrors before the Sun of the Point. Had He not appeared, no mention of shadows in mirrors would exist. God hath commanded all His creation to know the Truth, and whoso knoweth Him Whom God shall make manifest hath known the Truth, since all stand through Him and nothing possesseth existence save through Him. But make this thy work that I may teach thee, for on the Day of Resurrection, at the hour of thy glory, thou shalt find for thyself glory in having known the Truth. And likewise are all thy conditions, whether in thy religion or thy worldly affairs, in thy first or thy last estate, for all subsist through Him. Whoso knoweth Him is veiled by naught, and God hath created naught save for His knowledge and for detachment from all that hath being through union with the Dawning-Place of His certitude. He accepteth naught from creation save the essence of essences, even were it but a single word in their knowledge of Him and His good-pleasure with them. Let not the books which have been composed in the Bayan, nor the Bayan itself, contend with thee, for all that was for belief in Him, and this is manifested through the word "yea" and its acceptance from that soul is its faith, and this is manifested through His word or through a sign from His presence - these two are the fruit of existence from the creation and with Him. Be not veiled by aught else, that ye may be saved on the day of His manifestation.The twenty-fourth chapter of the first Vahid of the twenty-fourth day of the year concerning the knowledge of the Name the Perfect, which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. God, there is no God but He, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. Say: God is more perfect than every possessor of perfection. None in the heavens or on the earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His perfecting power. Verily He hath been the Perfecter, the Perfect, the All-Perfecting. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, and unto Him do all return. And unto God belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Subduer, the Inaccessible, the August. He it is Who created you by His command, and unto Him is the journeying. And unto God belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the August. He it is Who causeth you to turn about by night and by day. There is no God but He, the Exalted, the Mighty. He it is Who giveth life and death, and unto Him do all return. He it is Who createth what He willeth by His command "Be," and it is. He it is Who hath created you and what ye do. Reflect then upon the creation of your own selves: were God to forbid you, would ye be able to create? And similarly hath He established in your religion that God might show you the creation of your bodies that ye might be guided \[...\]

And verily thus was it decreed in your religion, that God might show you the creation of your bodies, that ye may be guided. And indeed all shall testify from the Point of the Bayan, and this is from Him Whom God shall make manifest - verily we are all submissive unto Him. He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them by His command. Say: Whatsoever God willeth, of wondrous creation. He is the One Who provideth sustenance to all in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them by His command. Say: Whatsoever God willeth, of gracious bounty. He is the One Who causeth you to die and then giveth you life, and verily within His grasp are the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: Whatsoever God willeth, of all-knowing wisdom. He is the One Who aideth whomsoever He willeth by His command. His is the greatness and the majesty in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: Whatsoever God willeth, of mighty assistance. He is the One Who createth whatsoever He willeth by His command, and verily unto Him shall ye return. And perchance God createth from a soul from the beginning that hath no beginning, and its cycle in the commands of Command and Creation, and God on the Day of Resurrection regardeth him whom God regardeth and loveth. That is what returneth unto God even though in all the worlds he be amongst those who prostrate themselves. Therefore look ye unto the glory of what God decreeth concerning him who turneth away from all that hath been borne in the worlds of Command and Creation, and judgeth by the glance of an eye. Thus doth God regard the essence of your deeds, but ye perceive not. Say: God judgeth with truth, and verily He is the All-Knowing, the Most Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Beloved. And He accepteth from such a soul its return unto Himself inasmuch as it regardeth the Manifestation of His Self with the eye of His love, and rejecteth all that it hath wrought in the worlds of Command and Creation. Thus doth God regard on the Day of Resurrection the essence of your deeds. Therefore weary not yourselves and look ye unto the essence of that whereby your deeds are accepted, for all that ye do is that He Whom God shall make manifest may say "I have accepted it from you." There is no fruit of your deeds above this. But ye perform every deed while remaining veiled from its fruit. Thus doth God counsel you in every Resurrection that ye may be saved through God's grace and mercy. But from Resurrection unto Resurrection the eye of God regardeth you, and verily He is with you wheresoever ye may be. Yet ye remain veiled from the commands which God hath commanded you, that ye might ascend unto the good-pleasure of God. All this after the Point of the Bayan regardeth you without being pleased with what He commanded you, but ye understand not. And God is independent of you and your deeds, so do as ye wish, then ye shall find His glory by virtue of what God saith ye have done. Thus are all tried. And God speaketh the truth, but ye know not. Say: Verily perfection is with the Truth, not with aught else, and that which is with aught else is like the sun that ye find in mirrors. Therefore seek ye all perfection from Him Whom God shall make manifest if ye desire the perfection of God, and if ye desire the perfection of creation from Him, ye shall not find it there. Say: God hath manifested Me in My beginning and My end (from what is attributed?) unto you, and God hath honored Me in My beginning \[...\]

God has honored me in my first and last state with that which is attributed to Him. Therefore, you should recognize the unity of God in all His names and their likenesses, that on the Day of Resurrection you may not be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest.The Second in the Second:In the Name of God, the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect! Glory be to Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Glory, Thine the Sovereignty and the Earthly Realm, Thine the Honor and the Majesty, Thine the Countenance and the Beauty, Thine the Direction and the Perfection, Thine the Grandeur and the Exaltation, Thine the Mercy and the Grace, Thine the Gift and the Bounty, Thine the Might and Justice, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Transcendence, Thine the Joy and the Gladness, Thine the Trial and the Detachment, Thine is what is seen and unseen from the highest heights to the primal atom. All are Thy creation, O my God, and in Thy grasp.I bear witness that Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and that Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Thou hast ever been One God, Single, Independent, Alone, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son.Let all things glorify Thee according to their essence, let all things sanctify Thee according to their reality, let all things testify to Thy unity according to their truth, let all things thank Thee according to their substance, let all things magnify Thee according to their nature, let all things be detached unto Thee according to their disposition, and let all things exalt Thee according to their own being. For Thou art the One, the Single, the Alone, the Powerful, the Independent.Thou hast raised up the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them without pillars, from nothing, by Thy command, as a manifestation of Thy power, a perfection of the appearance of Thy grace, an exaltation of Thy Word, and an assertion of Thy Self-Subsistence. I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that I have believed in Thee in the Point of the Bayan through what Thou hast revealed unto it, and I shall prepare thereby to believe in Thee on the Day of Resurrection through what Thou shalt manifest, for I find none independent besides Thee, nor any powerful other than Thee.What appeareth between the two Manifestations appeareth through Thy Manifestation, for from the first moment when Thou didst reveal the Furqan until the time when Thou didst reveal the Bayan, all the years and their peoples have revolved around the twenty-three years of the manifestation of Thy Beloved of old, as all that was ordained from that day until this day was ordained within twenty-three years. And I bear witness likewise regarding the Bayan that until the Day of Him Whom Thou shalt manifest, all that the nights and days revolve around revolveth around what Thou hast ordained from the first revelation of the Bayan until what Thou hast ordained in the Book.Therefore, praise be to Thee for what Thou hast ordained, decreed, and caused to flow, bearing witness to Thy oneness in the eternity of eternities and Thy independence in every condition without limitation or decline, for what lieth between the Manifestations is raised up to Him Whom Thou hast manifested, and all measures take shelter in the shadow of Him Whom Thou hast established. Glory be to Thee! There is no God but Thee.The Third Gate \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Complete, the Most Complete. There is no God but He, the Most Complete, the Most Complete. Say: God is the most complete above all possessors of completion. None can withhold from the Sovereign King of His completion, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lies between them. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Complete, the Perfect, the Consummate.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and earth and what lies between them make mention. Say: All are humble before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Force and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall bring to completion the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest from His presence. Verily He is powerful over all things. Say: Verily God shall bring to completion the Cause of the Primal Point by His command. Verily He is the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.Say: Verily God shall bring to completion His light in the Bayan and shall exalt it to the highest elevation. All of you draw nigh unto God your Lord through it, though on that Day ye shall not recognize the light of God, nor shall ye draw nigh unto Us through them.O ye who have been given the Bayan! Watch over your souls, for verily ye in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest do not consider that ye desire aught but the good pleasure of God, yet ye endure in that which is contrary to God's good pleasure, even as those who lived in the days of the Primal Point never imagined they desired aught but what God desired, yet they were veiled from God and followed not what God had desired, having deemed themselves believers while failing to reflect upon those who in the days of Muhammad likewise supposed they sought God's good pleasure, though they had cut themselves off from God's good pleasure after being veiled from Muhammad's good pleasure, yet they perceived it not.O people of the Bayan! Consider not that ye shall be like those who were given the Furqan or were given the Gospel or were given the Books aforetime, yet ye are not far from being veiled like them when God appears, though ye consider not that ye are veiled \[...\]

Nay, rather, when ye are veiled from God at the time of His Manifestation, ye reckon not that ye are veiled, but consider: how were those who were given the Furqan veiled? Verily, ye too are veiled like unto them, though ye imagine ye do well. Were ye to realize your veiling, ye would prefer to be counted as non-existent upon the earth and be not remembered thereon. A day shall come when ye will long to know aught of God's good-pleasure, yet shall find no way unto Him. Ye shall wander even as camels wander, finding no pasture that might unite you upon a matter whereof ye are assured. Then shall God cause the Sun of Truth to dawn, and from His presence shall flow forth oceans of bounty and grace, while ye, desiring but a drop, do hold back from these seas of water. If ye be in doubt of this, then consider those who were given the Gospel: when they were cut off from the successors of Jesus, they sought contentment in their temples that they might discover somewhat of God's good-pleasure, yet found no way unto Him. Then when God made manifest Muhammad, the Messenger of God, the treasury of all His good-pleasure, they quickened not themselves with the water of life from their Lord, but sought upon earth a mere drop of water from behind, imagining themselves to be God-fearing. And like unto them are they who were given the Furqan, and ye, O people of the Bayan, are like unto them. Therefore watch over your souls, lest ye deprive yourselves of the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, though ye supplicate by night and day for the meeting with God. And deprive not yourselves of the ocean of His good-pleasure while ye wander upon earth seeking but a drop of water, finding no way unto Him. Say: The proof of God hath been perfected in the Bayan, and after God sent down the Bayan, His grace was completed unto all who are on earth. Therefore ascribe not unto yourselves the cessation of God's outpouring, for verily His mercy hath been perfected and completed unto those who were given the Bayan until the Day of Resurrection, if ye be of them who are assured of the signs of God. And We have ordained the cutting down of certain trees that what \[is planted\] in the Bayan might be strengthened. Lo, We did send down mighty trees from among those who believed in the Point of the Furqan, more than ye can count. Yet We desired not to cut them down, for they, through being veiled from the Living One of the Furqan, did cut themselves off. And We do make mention of those who believed in the Living One of the Furqan. And among them were those who claimed wisdom and knowledge, more than can be numbered. Yet We shall mention one who is known among them, that those who are known in the Bayan might be assured. And We shall begin from the land of the House of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. We found there one who believed in Muhammad and then His witnesses, and was among the learned. This is a Book from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. O Sharif! We created thee from a beginning that had no beginning until We made thee manifest in the Furqan and made thee, through the Primal Point therein, to be among the believers. Then We guided thee and made thee to be among the believers who were guides unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God. When thy guidance in the Furqan was complete, We made Our Self known to thee through clear verses in the Book, yet We found thee not among those who were assured. And thou didst present thyself before Us at the House of God several times, and We recited unto thee from the words of God that We had sent down. Then We entered thy house as a mercy from Us \[...\]

We have recited unto thee such of the words of God as We have been sending down. Then did We enter into thy house, as a mercy from Our presence and as a bounty unto thee among all the worlds. If thou hadst perceived aught of God's purpose in the Qur'an when thou didst behold Our Book or hear Our verses, then wouldst thou at that moment have been among those who prostrate themselves and among those who say: "Glory be to Thee, O God! There is no God but Thee! Thou didst create me and sustain me and cause me to die and bring me to life and didst make me know Thyself on the Day of Resurrection even as Thou didst make me know Thyself aforetime in the Qur'an, and verily I am the first of them that worship." But since thou didst veil thyself, thou hast strayed from that whereby thou wast guided. Thou didst worship Us throughout thy life, yet when We made Ourselves known unto thee, thou didst not say concerning Our Remembrance that He is indeed possessed of a manifest truth. Thus doth God, thy Lord, try thee on the Day of Resurrection, for He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. And hadst thou said "Yea" when We sent down the Book unto thee, We would surely have numbered thee among Our believing servants and would have glorified thee in the Book until the Day when all shall be brought before Us. And this would have profited thee more than all that thou hast worshipped God through thyself in thy life, nay, from the beginning that hath no beginning, for this would have benefited thee not, while this would surely have benefited thee, and We are witness unto all things. And after We created thee for Our meeting on the Day of Resurrection, thou didst veil thyself from Us without right or illuminating Book. And wert thou among those endowed with the knowledge of the Bayan, when thou lookest upon the Book thou wouldst surely testify that there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and thou wouldst surely say: "He Who sent down the Qur'an hath indeed sent this down - all is from God, there is no doubt therein, we all believe in it." But that which was decreed hath come to pass, and if thou returnest unto Us while We are sending down the verses of God, We shall surely transform thy fire into light, for We are powerful over all things. And if the matter be cut off from thee, there shall be no way for thee save that thou believe and charge that mention of thy faith reach Him Whom God shall make manifest, that it may benefit thee and thy fire be transformed into light. This is what We have been revealing, and what We have revealed hath been revealed - it hath been determined and made distinct, and there can be no change therein from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We justly banished thee from Our presence, for We are indeed just. This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto Sulayman in the land of Muscat on the right side of the sea. Verily, there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. I created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life and made thee among the learned ones in the Qur'an, that perchance when We make Ourselves known unto thee, thou mayest know at once and be among those who prostrate themselves. When We sent down unto that land, and there was with Us one who remembered God, his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, We sent down unto thee a Book containing clear verses - believe thou in God and in His verses and be of them that are assured. And therein have We completed Our proof against thee and against all who are on earth where We have been sending down. Were all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them to assemble together to produce the like of that Book, they would never be able nor would they have power, even were We to make them eloquent ones upon the earth. Even as thou didst adduce proof from the Qur'an, God shall adduce proof through that Book in the Bayan, as a command from His presence, for He is indeed All-Knowing, All-Powerful. If thou be of the believers, there is no way for thee except \[...\]

Though We have made them to be eloquent beings on earth, in accordance with what thou hast inferred from the Quran, yet God will demonstrate through this Book in the Bayan a decree from His presence, for verily He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. If thou art of the believers, there is no path for thee except that thou shouldst be among those who believe in Him. This is the path of God for whomsoever dwelleth in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted.Then did We ascend to the House from that land, and when We returned from the House to that land as One Who descendeth, We observed that thou didst not remember that which We had revealed unto thee, nor wert thou among the believers, even after We had created thee for the encounter with Our own Self and had been revealing unto thee. Thou didst not comprehend that for which thou wast created, though throughout thy life thou wert among those who worship God. Therefore, all that thou hast acquired shall profit thee not, inasmuch as thou wert veiled from Our presence and then from Our Book - a decree from Our presence, for verily We are just.When We revealed the Book unto thee, had thou followed what was therein, it would have been better for thee than worshipping God, thy Lord, from a beginning that hath no beginning until now, even hadst thou been among the sincere in thy worship. And had thou attained unto the presence of God in that land, it would have been better for thee than all the prostrations thou hast made before God from a beginning that hath no beginning until now, if thou hadst been among those who were certain of meeting God in the Primal Point.We did test thee but found thee not among those who were aware. Therefore have We banished thee - a just decree from Our presence, for verily We are just. And shouldst thou return unto Us, We shall transform thy banishment into confirmation, for We are indeed bountiful. And if the Cause be cut off from the Primal Point, then verily the verses of God have been made firm and there is no changing them, and all are certain of them.Yea, thou shouldst write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and arrange for the letter to reach Him. Perchance God may forgive thee and transform thy banishment into confirmation by His leave, for verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Most Excellent. Otherwise there is no path for thee, and naught of what thou hast acquired shall profit thee, inasmuch as thou wert veiled from saying "yea." We have rendered thee and thy deeds as the day We created thee, when thou wert not among those who act.Let those who have been given the Bayan take heed from thee and watch over their souls when the Book of Him Whom God shall make manifest is revealed unto them, that they may ponder therein and then glorify their own selves. Verily Our mercy hath preceded all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven and whatsoever lieth between them, and then all who are in the worlds. However, those who have been veiled from the signs of God, these shall not enter into the mercy of God.The twenty-fourth chapter of the twenty-sixth Unity of the sixth month of the year concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Clothed One, which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Clothing, the Most Clothing. By thy oath in the letter Ba, there is no God but He, the Most Clothing, the Most Clothing. Say: God is more clothing than any possessor of clothing. None in the heavens or on earth can withhold himself from the dominion of His sovereign clothing.

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down in adoration unto Him. And praise be to God before Whom all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth and all that are between them extol His glory. Say: All stand obedient before Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He causeth to live and to die, then causeth to die and to live, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He hath power over all things.Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Say: Verily God will clothe you with the raiment of guidance if, when God clotheth you, ye will be clothed therewith and then be thankful. Whosoever clotheth a believing man or believing woman with any garment, God will surely give him in Paradise two thousand garments of resplendent silk. This is of God's grace and mercy towards those who clothe the orphans and those who are unable to earn for themselves. And God will surely cause all believers to earn, therefore wear ye nothing except the raiment of glory and modesty, for this is nearer unto you in the Book of God when ye shall be brought into the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection.Make the beauty of what ye wear commensurate with the finest ye can afford, for this is of God's grace and mercy toward you if ye are able; and if not, grieve not in the least, for verily after your death ye shall behold in Paradise what ye have done. Make not your garments too short nor too long, but observe moderation therein according to what ye love best to wear. And wear not the attire of those who are heedless when they dress, like those who were given the Book aforetime. God loveth them not, nor their attire. God loveth those who are God-fearing in the Bayan and who wear the raiment of glory and modesty.In these days the chosen ones wear what is best of your garments. God loveth for you a tall, noble black cloak, or a lofty, sublime broadcloth cloak. Say: The cloak (aba) is better than all other outer garments. This garment lendeth you dignity while the others do not, nay rather they take you beyond the bounds of dignity, except for the Bukharian outer garments ye wear in cold weather. If in this matter ye conduct yourselves with propriety and attraction, it is better for you in the Book of God. All these are beneficial ways within your limits if ye don the raiment of guidance and godliness. How many are the servants who wear silk all their lives yet are clothed in the garment of fire because they wear not the raiment of guidance and godliness. And how many are the servants who throughout their lives wear coarse cotton or wool \[...\]

How many servants there are who throughout their lives wear only rough cotton or wool, yet because they have donned the garment of guidance and piety, they have been clothed in the robes of God's good-pleasure and find delight in His satisfaction. And if you can combine both by wearing the garments of guidance and piety along with the silk of the Most Glorious, this would be better for you in God's sight if you are able; and if not, be not grieved. Moreover, be God-fearing and clothe your children until they complete their first year in the most excellent garments you can afford, as a gift from God unto them, that they may be thankful. Whether male or female, this is a gift from God unto them both, that they may thereby present robes of good-pleasure unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Were it not for Him, We would not have commanded any command nor forbidden any prohibition. But for the exaltation of His remembrance and the triumph of His Cause have We commanded you with commandments from Our presence, for verily We are the Commander, and have forbidden you prohibitions from Our presence, for verily We are the Forbidder. This is so that you may attain unto God's good-pleasure from His presence at the time of His manifestation, and avoid all that He detesteth. Say: The good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest is the good-pleasure of God, and whatever He detesteth is detested by God. Seek ye refuge in God's good-pleasure from that which God detesteth. Say: The signs of His good-pleasure are those who believe in Him and are convinced of His truth, while the signs of His displeasure are those who, when they hear the verses of God from His presence or behold the words of God from His presence, do not at once believe and are not convinced. Say: The turban hath been created for those among you who are endowed with knowledge, even if all of you are blessed with what God hath given you, then be ye dignified. And if what you place upon your heads equals in its numerical value the letters Waw and Nun, there is no harm upon you if you are God-fearing in His religion. This is your adornment for your little ones, and verily the most honored among you in God's sight is the most God-fearing, whether you wear turbans or glory in other attire. God hath forbidden you from wearing shoes other than those made of leather. Say: This would cause you to transgress the bounds of your dignity if you were to observe with the eye of justice. However, when you walk in leather shoes, you are elevated and thereby dignified. Say: The criterion for all your clothing is that you make it refined and beautiful, such that through it you may attract, elevate, honor and dignify - all this if you are able. God doth not command you except according to your capacity. He hath permitted you your silks and fine cottons that ye may give thanks in the paradise of the Bayan. And God hath permitted unto you whatsoever equals in its numerical value the word "Munir" (Luminous), that ye may be thankful in the days of God. This is the most glorious thing in your possession if you would but observe it with insight - that you should possess only that which hath no equal, that you may be educated thereby and then, on the Day of Resurrection, prostrate yourselves in glory before Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is a book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto him who is learned in a land whose name equals in its numerical value the name "Al-Harith". Verily, there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. I created thee from a beginning that hath no beginning \[...\]

God hath permitted you that which equateth in name with the number of Munir, that ye may be of them that render thanks in the days of God. This is more glorious than what ye possess, would ye but perceive it with your eyes - that ye should possess naught save that which hath no likeness, that ye may thereby be educated, and that on the Day of Resurrection ye may prostrate yourselves in might before Him Whom God shall make manifest. This is a Book from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto him who was learned in the land whose name equateth with the number of Al-Harith. Verily, there is no God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. I created thee from a beginning that had no beginning, and sustained thee, and caused thee to die, and made thee live again for the Day whereon I would make Myself known unto thee, that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. When I made Myself known unto thee through Our Messenger who is called by the name of Ali, the third of the first One, thou wert not among those who recognized, even after Our proof was completed against thee through Ali himself, apart from the Book, if thou be of them that remember. And when thou didst behold the Book at the time We sent it down unto thee - if thou hadst been among the discerning ones in the Furqan - thou didst testify before the Messenger that there is no God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. This hath been sent down from God even as the Furqan was sent down aforetime - verily, we all believe in it. Yet thou didst veil thyself and those who were in that land without right or illuminating Book. God will surely question thee concerning all who \[were veiled\] in that land, for hadst thou been truthful to the words of God and been among the deliverers, those who were in that land would have followed, and they would have been among them that prostrate themselves before Us night and day. And We did sail upon that land with exaltation and inaccessible, lofty might, from a seat of glory, transcendent and impregnable, and We were in that land for years of Ha, in utmost contentment. Then We sent down unto thee the Book from the land of Fa, desiring to guide thee before all the worlds. Thou didst veil thyself by what thou hadst and deemed thyself among the God-fearing. When thou didst return unto the Messenger - and if thou hadst returned unto him thou wouldst have been among them that return unto God thy Lord - what was decreed was decreed, until We were among them that alighted there when We desired to perform pilgrimage to the House. We witnessed that thou wert veiled from the First Book. We awakened thee with another Book wherein were clear signs from Us for all the worlds. We completed Our proof against thee and against all who are on earth, wert thou among them that ponder. If God had sent down unto thee in the Furqan clear verses, would not God's proof thereby have been established against thee and then against all who are on earth among the deliverers? Say: Yea, this is that wherein there is no doubt, a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. Then by what thou \[readest\] aforetime, there is no way in the Book for thee except that thou shouldst read this thereafter. Say: All is from God and we all believe in all, wert thou among them that are discerning in the knowledge of the Bayan. When the Book fell into thy right hand, thou shouldst have testified unto God thy Lord and unto all things that there is no God but He. This hath verily been sent down from God, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, the Most High.

All things testify that there is none other God but Him. This hath been sent down from God, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, the Glorious. But since thou art veiled by that which thou possessest, thou hast failed to perceive the signs of God in a wondrous creation. Though We created every created thing aforetime, when We desire to create anew thereby We shall do so, for We are powerful over all things. We are indeed independent of all things, We are indeed sovereign over all things, We are indeed knowers of all things, and We are indeed manifest unto all things. When We heard thee make mention of another Book from Our presence, thou wert among those who sought guidance. We ascended unto the House of God until We returned, and We were dwelling in that land. We heard not that thou didst make mention of the First Messenger, nor of the Other Book, and thou wert among those endowed with insight. We showed mercy unto thee and informed thee of what We were revealing there, until Our mercy towards thee was complete, yet We found thee not among those possessed of understanding. Say: Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and desired to attain somewhat of His good-pleasure, and in this thou didst consider thyself among the sincere ones. God thy Lord made Himself known unto thee through what We made known of Ourselves unto thee, yet thou wert not among those who sought to know Him. After We created thee for the meeting with Our Self in the Furqan, if thou wert among those assured of what We revealed in the third verse of the Surah, thou didst not present thyself before Us to attain the presence of God, but remained veiled from that for which thou wert created, supposing thyself to be among the virtuous ones. Nay, by no means! We have questioned thee concerning thyself, then concerning all that was from thyself in that land, a severe questioning, that thou mightest deserve that God thy Lord should punish thee for every soul that remained veiled in that land, with justice from His presence, for He is truly just and equitable. Had thou manifested guidance and faith, those upon that land would have believed in God and His signs, and would have entered their souls into the paradise of His good-pleasure among the believers. But since thou wert veiled, they became veiled, and God will guide them and thee whenever He willeth, for He is the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Omniscient. Should thou return unto Us while We are revealing the verses of God, We shall transform thy fire into light and shall forgive thy sins as a bounty from Our presence, for We are indeed the Forgiving. But if the matter is decided, there shall be no path for thee unto the Cause of God, and what hath been revealed hath been detailed and made firm until the Day when all shall be brought before God thy Lord. Yea, shouldst thou write a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and arrange for it to reach Him, perchance God will transform thy fire into light and pardon what thou didst aforetime, for He is verily the Pardoning, the Forgiving, the All-Merciful. When We cut thee off in the Furqan, it was to strengthen what We have caused to grow in the Bayan, with justice from Our presence, for We are indeed just. Return thou unto Us, for We are indeed forgiving. Unto Us belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and We are indeed in every condition independent of all things \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Penetrating, the Most Penetrating! There is no God but He, the Most Penetrating, the Most Penetrating. Say: God is more penetrating than any possessor of penetration. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withstand the sovereignty of His penetrating power. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been penetrating, piercing and pervasive.Glorified be He before Whom bow down in adoration all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are submissive unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will cause your hearts to deviate if ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and God will remove the deviation of your hearts if ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: God hath desired naught in the Bayan except to bring you back to a single soul, even as He brought you forth from a single soul. This is what God hath desired in the Bayan, would that ye might comprehend.On the Day when God desired to bring you forth from the Bayan, did ye recognize any living ones, or martyrs, or guides, or names, or believers? Thus doth God desire that on the Day of Resurrection ye should recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, and ye, who were created by the command of the Point of the Bayan for the exaltation of His Word, should not be veiled from Him Who created you.Before He brought you forth from the Point of the Bayan, had ye any mention, and how could ye have had any book or ordinance? Be not heedless of your origin, that perchance on the day of your help ye may be saved. God hath not commanded you concerning the Living One, nor the Guides of Truth, nor the Martyrs of Justice, except for the exaltation of the remembrance of the Primal Point, would that ye might take heed. All this is for the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His appearance, would that ye might remember.Ye shall return unto God even as ye were brought forth, and say not "how" or "why" if ye desire the fruit of your beginning to be manifest in your return. All who are brought forth in the Bayan - the fruit of their beginning will not appear except that they return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. That is your beginning unto God and then your return unto God, if ye but knew.That wherein ye boil the water of the One - its substance equalleth His name, the name of Light, decreased by one, if ye would calculate. Thus doth God elevate the minerals to the horizon of names as a bounty from His presence. Verily, there is no God but I, the One, the Luminous.Make not yourselves lower than the minerals on the Day of Resurrection by entering beneath the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may raise you to the horizon of names, if ye desire to be elevated. Say: God will surely raise everything to the highest horizon possible for it. Verily, He is All-Knowing, Powerful, Wise.Say: God hath created the creation of the Bayan with five aspects equal to the number of the letter Ha in the Gate, would that ye might reflect a little on the causes of your creation. Say: The first is the verses of God, a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. Then the second is that whereby the servant is called unto God, his Lord\[...\]

Say: God shall elevate the minerals to the horizon of names as a bounty from His presence - there is no God but Him, the One, the Effulgent. Let not yourselves be accounted lower than minerals on the Day of Resurrection by entering beneath the shadow of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may raise you to the horizon of names, if you desire to be elevated. Say: God shall elevate all things to the highest horizon possible for them. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Wise.Say: God hath created the creation of the Bayan with five aspects, the number of Ha in the Gate, would that you might reflect upon the causes of your creation. Say: The first is the verses of God, a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. The second is that whereby the servant is called to God his Lord, and is addressed as a remembrance from the Primal Point unto God, the Lord of all worlds. The third is sermons that have ascended in the kingdom of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them - none can reckon their loftiness and sublimity in their eloquence and rhetoric, all the eloquent ones. Then elevated words that have been perfected and detailed in the essences of knowledge and wisdom, whereby you are educated. Then words that have been distinguished, perfected, adorned and magnified in the tongue of the eloquent ones among those who are known as Persians. These fruits hath God manifested from the Tree of Oneness, by which all shall be sustained until the Day of Resurrection. All these fruits have ripened from a single Tree - it behooveth it not to bear fruit save that there is no God but I, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The first is for the rulers, then the ministers, then the judges, then the learned, then the helpers - these are stations of your glory with you, and all are created by the signs of God.Say: God hath manifested this Tree from among those who traffic in the Book of God, then hath He elevated it above the learned ones, the wise ones, the ministers and the sovereigns, as a command from His presence. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: God hath created for these stations five signs for their glory, that you might be elevated by the signs of God. Say: The diamond is the first sign, then yellow ruby the second sign, then green emerald the third sign, then red ruby the fourth sign, then a pearl unequalled among pearls the fifth sign - a remembrance from His presence. There is no God but Him, the King, the Guardian, the Exalted.Say: When God desired to elevate these stations to a horizon that none among the worlds could approach, He therefore commanded all the sovereigns in the Bayan to place upon their heads five types of jewels as a sign from His presence, lest any soul approach these stations save by leave of God, the Sovereign, the Supreme. O ye who possess dominion and sovereignty! God hath prescribed for you that ye should take from the jewels We have created the number of Ha, and arrange them upon your heads as ornaments, as glory for what hath descended from the Primal Tree and for yourselves. And when God manifesteth the Primal Point, then shall ye all place these before Him if ye believe in God and His signs, and in the words We have set above your heads while ye are exalted.

And His verses and the words which We have set above your heads, ye are of those who soar above them. And if ye be veiled, verily God is independent of you and of whatsoever ye possess, while ye are all in need of God's good-pleasure if ye be of those who worship Him. Ye cannot content God through yourselves if ye desire to please God, for ye only please Him through Him. And God will not be pleased with you unless He Whom God shall make manifest is pleased with your own selves, if ye desire God's good-pleasure. Then ye shall possess from Him Whom God shall make manifest. And if ye make the numerical value of the letter Ha ninety-five, equaling the number of God in the Book of God, it is better for your own selves. And none shall possess this save you, and God and those like you shall not possess you except Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye desire to enter your own selves into the dominion of God. That which belongeth to God reacheth Him Whom God shall make manifest, and that which belongeth not to God reacheth Him not, after all have been created for God and all worship Him.This is a Book, this is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of the Bayan: Bear thou witness that there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Let him who hath worshipped Me all his life be cut off, for when I made Myself known to him through thyself, he was not of those who recognized Me. O servant of the Master! Bear thou witness before God and all things that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. I created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and made thee live again for the Day when I would make Myself known to thee, that thou mightest say: "Yea! Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Verily Thou art the Lord of the worlds!" And from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, We have sustained thee that on the Day of My manifestation thou mightest yield the fruit of saying "Yea," but We found thee not among those who responded. The Cause of God had reached the Third Letter of the First Unity, yet thou wast not among those who remembered. And when thou didst behold a sign from Our signs greater than what was sent through the Messenger, Our proof was completed against thee and against all who dwell on earth, if thou be of those who reflect.Then when We desired the House, thou didst present thyself before God, thy Lord, yet thou wast not among those who recognized. Thou wast veiled by thinking that revelation had ended with Muhammad, the Messenger of God, while We were witness in the First Book. Yea, He Who revealed unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, had revealed unto Ali before Muhammad. Is there any god besides God who could reveal unto anyone verses so manifest that the world would be powerless before them? Since thou hast acknowledged the revelation through Muhammad, the Messenger of God, there is no way for thee except to acknowledge for the Primal Point all that is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Is there anything besides the Quran revealed from God, before which all are powerless, to prove that this is revealed from God, if thou be of those who are endowed with insight? What then prevented thee in the Bayan from being convinced that this is from God, the Inaccessible, the Most High, the Glorious? And as to the essence of the matter, were We to reckon with thee, thou wouldst not possess the worth of anything, and We are indeed knowing. If thou sayest "Yea" when thou hearest the verses of God, it is as though thou hadst worshipped God from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment \[...\]

And verily We were knowing ones. If thou sayest "Yea" when thou hast heard the verses of God, it is as though thou hadst worshipped God from that beginning which hath no beginning until this moment, and had not disobeyed God, thy Lord, for the twinkling of an eye. But after thou hadst been God-fearing throughout thy life and had striven in God's path that naught should enter thy heart save His good-pleasure, it profiteth thee not the weight of a mustard seed that thou wert veiled from God at the time of His manifestation while thou wert among the patient ones. And verily the divines who were in the Land of Kaf, all like unto thee, God will surely question them: "How is it that a Messenger and a Book came down to you, and after ye witnessed your powerlessness, ye followed not the command of God from the Messenger, and were not among the believers?" Then all that thou wert veiled on that land, its fire shall return unto thee, since thou wert their chief, if thou art of the mindful ones. And if thou hadst followed God's command, those in thy land would have followed thee, and all would have entered themselves into the Paradise of God's good-pleasure, wherein they would have dwelt eternally. Therefore thou shouldst wish that God had never created thee. Thou didst make thyself a divine in Islam to save one of the believers, yet thou didst cause those who followed thee to enter the fire, since thou wert veiled from the verses of God at the time of their appearance while deeming thyself among the God-fearing ones. Thus what profiteth thee what thou wert veiled from before, and by entering into thy religion thou hast departed therefrom, if thou art of the discerning ones. For thou hadst not seen a Prophet, nor an Imam, nor a Gate, nor a miracle which all the worlds were powerless before, except that thou didst see the Furqan and thereby enter Islam, then saw the First Book and departed from what thou hadst entered. If thou hast proof the weight of a mustard seed thereof, then mention it before God if thou art of the discerning ones. Nay, by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest, God hath not given unto thee nor unto any of His servants any proof. God is manifest above His servants and supreme over all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them by His command, and verily He hath power over all things. Thou hast named thyself servant of the Master, yet God hath manifested thy Master and thou hast seen Him but recognized Him not, though God created thee for His meeting, if thou art of those who are certain of the third verse of the Surah of Thunder. And if thou sayest "How can we recognize Him when we have not heard clear verses?", yea, just as thou didst witness and recognize Muhammad the Messenger of God in the Furqan, how didst thou not recognize Him Who sent down the Book unto thee, though thou didst call thyself His servant, and verily He is the Guardian over what was sent down to the worlds? If thou returnest unto Us when God sendeth down verses unto Us, perchance God will transform thy fire into light - verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Otherwise what hath been sent down hath been made firm and detailed, and there is no altering it from God - all shall be certain of it until the Day of Resurrection. God desireth not to cut it off; how could it be cut off except by returning unto God? Then if God willeth and turneth, verily he is among those who are cut off in a new and impregnable creation. Yea.

And turn away, for he is among those who are cut off in a creation sublime and impregnable. Yea, even if the verses are cut off, thou shalt write a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and charge that it be delivered unto Him, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, then repent unto Him and be of the sincere ones. Perchance God, in the later Resurrection, will transform thy fire into light. Verily, He is the Protecting Lord, the Forgiving One, before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them, and unto Him shall all return. We counsel thee to deliver thyself from the fire, and then those upon that land, that thou mayest enter an exalted and sublime Paradise. Otherwise thou shalt surely die and enter the fire, and thou shalt find none beside God as protector or helper. This is how We have shown mercy unto thee as a bounty from Our presence, inasmuch as thou hast attributed thyself unto Us, and We are indeed cognizant of all things. We recognize thy piety, but it shall not profit thee since all piety is to know God thy Lord and to be among those who are certain of His signs. For when thou art veiled from God and His signs, thy piety shall not profit thee if thou art among the discerning. Thus have We cut thee off in justice, but shouldst thou return unto God, He will guide thee to an exalted and sublime seat of glory. Verily, We are independent of all things. It is equal to Us whether all believe or are veiled. But as for you, if ye believe, then after your death ye shall enter Paradise. Otherwise your spirits shall enter the fire and your bodies shall return to clay, and ye shall possess naught beneficial from God.The twenty-sixth Gate of the twenty-sixth Unity of the twenty-sixth Month. In the Name of God, the Most Hidden. Concerning the knowledge of the Name "the Most Hidden," which hath four stations. The first of the first concerneth the book of Shaykh Muhammad Hasan and Hasan Ali in the land of Kufa.In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. God! There is no God but He, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. Say: God is more hidden than all that is hidden. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the sovereign power of His concealment. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Concealer, the Hidden, the Obscure. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God will assuredly blot out all that hath come unto you if ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, or if ye believe but remain uncertain, or if ye are certain but fail to see, or if ye see but fail to uphold the Cause of God, or if ye uphold God's Cause yet fail to manifest before His presence all that behooveth Him from whatsoever is on earth. This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, from the Primal Point, testifying that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. We have indeed reckoned with Our servant through this which We have sent down from Our presence. Glory be unto Thee, O God! There is none other God but Thee. I am, verily, the first of them that answer Thy call.O Muhammad-Qablil-Hasan! We created thee from a beginning that had no beginning, then sustained thee, then caused thee to die, then brought thee back to life, then made thee know Our Self on the Day of Resurrection through Our signs, yet We found thee not among those who truly knew Us. We created thee only for the day when thou wouldst recognize My Self through My signs, that thou mightest testify that there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We initiated thee through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, in Islam, for We are the Bestower of bounties. We nurtured thee in Islam until We exalted thy mention among all the believers and caused thy tree to grow to such an extent that those who deemed themselves zealous adherents of their Faith sought thy protection. Yet after We had raised thee up, thy tree bore no fruit, not even to acknowledge "Yea." How could it be otherwise, when throughout thy life, though thou didst worship Us and strive according to what thou didst consider righteousness, until thou didst compose what thou didst devise concerning religion - five hundred thousand verses, or more, or less - hoping thereby to attain somewhat of God's good-pleasure and to deliver thyself from the fire after death and enter into a holy and sublime paradise? What passed between thee and God, We had kept concealed. We desire not, We desire not to lift the veil, for We are the Bestower of bounties. Yet when We made Ourself known unto thee through an Apostle and a Book in the first year, We found thee neither among those who truly knew Us nor among those who remembered. I am, verily, thy Qa'im, thy Master, thy Guide, and thy Mahdi, Who was promised unto thee and unto all Muslims. God hath manifested Me in the year one thousand two hundred and seventy from the time God revealed the Furqan, with clear signs whereat all the world stands powerless, whereby God had established the religion of Muhammad aforetime, that God might make manifest whatsoever He pleaseth thereafter. Verily, He hath power over all things. We concealed Our names in the First Book after We had revealed all the most beautiful names for Ourselves, that all might then be numbered among the believers, and We revealed therein that there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, lest thou shouldst expect aught else after God. And at that time thou wert among those who hastened unto the Cause of God. The Apostle came unto thee bearing an impregnable and exalted Book whose verses were perfected by the Beloved, the Most High, the Sublime. Thou didst hear \[...\]

And with Him is a Book, impregnable and inviolable, its verses perfected by the exalted and glorious Beloved. Thou hast heard and seen, yet perceived not the Revelation of God, and deemed thyself among the God-fearing. We have assuredly revealed in the First Book all concerning which ye differ, and have judged between you according to what was sent down in the Furqan, that none among you should be veiled, and that ye might be assured of God's command. We found you not following the path which God revealed in the Furqan, except that ye have innovated in your religion what profiteth you not the weight of a mustard seed, and which verily veileth you from God's good-pleasure, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.If thou didst desire God's good-pleasure, why, after the Messenger came to thee, didst thou not follow His good-pleasure and wert not among those who are endowed with insight? When thou heardst a verse, thou didst not say "yea." We have rendered thee and thy deeds as dust, even as on the day when thou didst naught - a just recompense from God, for We are truly just. For all that God hath revealed in religion is but a branch of that to which ye respond unto God and whereby ye know Him. And ye respond not unto God save that ye respond to and are promised that which cometh from Muhammad, the Expected Mahdi, the Promised One. Thus when the Messenger delivered unto thee or thou heardst a verse, thou didst depart from that which thou hadst entered into and wert not among the mindful.Consider how thou didst begin in thy religion. Didst thou see Muhammad the Messenger of God, or those who were witnesses after Him, or those who were the gates of guidance during the first occultation, or a miracle that would confound all the worlds? Nay, thou wert but raised in Islam, then saw the Book of God and deduced thereby that thou wert upon a firm and righteous path.When thou sawest the First Book like what thou hadst seen before in thy religion - for there is no altering God's command if thou art among the discerning - and by that which thou didst deduce concerning thy religion aforetime from the Furqan, God will likewise deduce through the Bayan against thee hereafter, for God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.Our proof hath been perfected through the First Book against all who dwell in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and We are witness over all things. It behooveth one such as thee to be the throne of Muhammad the Messenger of God, that We might resurrect it from thee, for verily We are powerful. By His life! Hadst thou been present before Us and been the first of believers, We would have assuredly resurrected from thee the return of Muhammad the Messenger of God, for verily We have power over all things, have power over all things.But thou hast veiled thyself from God's command, and the first of believers hath attained the grace of the First One. We have made him a Messenger from God unto all the worlds. And if the First Book reached thee in thy land, it was Ali, the third letter of the first Unity. Hadst thou known him, thou wouldst not have entered the Most Great Sanctuary, but wouldst have prostrated thyself before him with those who prostrate.The Day of Resurrection hath passed thee by, and thou hast gained naught but regret for thyself and for those believers who followed thee. God will assuredly punish thee for every believing man and woman who followed thee, for hadst thou followed God's command, thou wouldst have saved those who follow thee from the fire on the Day of Resurrection.

O thou who believest! Hadst thou followed God's command, those who follow thee would have been saved from the fire on the Day of Resurrection and would have entered a holy and exalted paradise. But since thou hast veiled thyself, they too became veiled. God will punish them for having been veiled from Him Who was veiled from God, whom they followed, supposing themselves to be among the God-fearing. The grace and mercy of God have indeed encompassed all worlds, but thou didst not enter into God's mercy even after God sent down unto thee the verse of mercy through a Messenger and an exalted and sublime Book. On this Day of Resurrection, thou hast not understood even a single letter of the Qur'an, else thou wouldst have been saved thereby on the Day of Resurrection amongst all peoples. And hadst thou followed the words revealed by Kazim, perchance thou wouldst have saved thyself and then the souls of the believers. Thou wert deceived by what thou hadst and wert veiled from what is with God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Verily what is with Him outshines what is with thee, if thou be of them that reflect. God hath favored those who were purified in His presence with knowledge of the inner mysteries and made them guides unto Himself in a mighty Book of truth. Now dost thou wish thou wert among those who gained knowledge in His presence and were among those seated before Him. But the matter is decreed, and thou canst find no way unto this. Thus doth God exalt the mention of those who endure and are sincere in His path. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Thus will God question those who were veiled from the essence of knowledge and wisdom from His presence, those whom God had bestowed His grace upon. He is indeed the Almighty, the Severe. Now that the matter is decreed concerning thee, and thou art unable in thy lifetime to return unto Us and be among those who seek forgiveness, God will transform thy fire into light and will exalt thy mention in the Book until the Day of Resurrection. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Otherwise, on the first day thou didst enter the fire, thou and those who followed thee, and if thou continuest thus, thou shalt enter the fire with those who enter therein. Hadst thou followed the truth on the first day, We would not have witnessed sorrow in God's path, as all followed thee, supposing thou wert among the recompensed ones. Every person in Islam who became veiled, their punishment shall return to thee, if thou be of them that reflect. Therefore have mercy upon thyself and deliver it from the fire, and fulfill what hath been decreed for thee in a sublime and true religion. Otherwise thou shalt surely die and return to dust, and after thy death thou shalt find no protector nor helper from God. All that thou hast seen in Islam - word upon word - all of it returneth to the Book of God, if thou be of them that understand. And this returneth unto God, if thou be of them that are assured. Say: God hath sent down the Furqan \[Qur'an\] aforetime through the tongue of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, then the Bayan afterward through the tongue of Muhammad, He Whom ye were all promised. If thou enterest into the religion of God, thou shalt be able to reach all Muslims and save from the fire those who await Us. But since thou hast veiled thyself, We have cut thee off so that what We have caused to grow in the Bayan might be strengthened - a command from God. Verily, We were among the obedient ones.

But because thou wert veiled, We have cut thee off that what We have caused to grow in the Bayan might be strengthened - a matter from God, verily, We were obedient ones. And shouldst thou return unto God, God will surely send down His mercy upon thee and will surely forgive thee - verily He is the Forgiving, the Self-Subsisting, the Pardoning. Have mercy, therefore, upon thyself, for verily thou shalt die, and if thou believest not, thou shalt enter the Fire and shalt not be among those who are victorious therein. We have delivered thee through this Book if thou art among those who are endowed with insight. Otherwise, verily We have been in all conditions independent of all things. Thou wert exalted in thy beginning, but on the day of thy return thou didst abase thyself with those who are veiled. Even as thou didst begin with Muhammad in Islam, so shalt thou return to the Primal Point in the Bayan, and verily what thou didst adduce before and after - God is with the God-fearing.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, to the Point of the Bayan: Bear thou witness that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto Hasan, this one upon the land of Ali, for verily We have been revealing clear verses in a mighty, impregnable Book. O Hasan! Verily We created thee from a beginning that hath no beginning, and We provided for thee, and favored thee, and gave thee life that thou mightest recognize Our Self through Our signs and be among those who attain unto knowledge. We have nurtured all who are in Islam for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, and We made Our proof amongst them to be the Furqan wherein is the detailed explanation of all things, and guidance and a reminder for all the worlds. When We had perfected what We had planted in Islam of lofty trees, We manifested that which ye were promised concerning Muhammad Mahdi, the exalted one. We sent down unto thee the Messenger with clear signs from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. When the Command of God reached thee, Our proof was completed against thee in Islam, and We were witness over all things. The tree of thy faith bore no fruit upon the word "yea" though throughout thy life thou wert among those who prostrated themselves before Us. Therefore, even as thou didst enter without insight, thou didst depart from that which thou hadst entered into, and verily We were cognizant of all things. Hadst thou comprehended but one letter of the Furqan, thou wouldst have saved thyself on the Day of Resurrection with the believers, and hadst thou believed in the Fire, thou wouldst have made thyself the second of the believers - We would have raised up Ali on thy behalf, and verily We were powerful over all things. But thou wert veiled from the Command of God and didst waste what thou hadst acquired from a beginning that hath no beginning until the end of thy life, being veiled from clear signs in a mighty, impregnable Book. And what thou didst witness profiteth thee not, what thou didst witness concerning the matter of Our messenger Ali in Baghdad when all the divines were gathered together and desired to pass judgment for Ali's execution without right or illuminating Book. And when thou didst doubt and waver concerning the decree of execution, We shall surely command the Fire not to burn thee therein as a recompense for what thou didst acquire there - verily We were gracious. Consider what good deeds thou hast acquired in thy life, yet none of them profit thee, nor is any attention paid to them.

And whatsoever thou hast turned unto and been perplexed by, without intending to aid it, how can that which returneth unto God benefit thee or shield thee from the fire? Consider this, O ye who are foremost among men, all of you, all of you together! Verily We created thee for the meeting with Our Self on the Day of Resurrection, yet thou hast not attained the portion of thine existence, though thou wert among those who had the means during the days of Our Manifestation, until death came from God, and there passed from thee that which all that is in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them could not equal, and We were watching over all things.Therefore shall We cut thee off that what We have caused to grow in the Bayan may be strengthened, and that those who shall come after in the Bayan may take warning, that perchance they may not enter into the fire on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest.They are not veiled from saying "yea," yet they destroy themselves and all their works while supposing they do well. And We shall forgive whom We will among Our servants and pardon whom We please, for verily We are the All-Forgiving.The twenty-seventh Gate of the twenty-sixth Unity of the twenty-sixth Month of the Year, concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Submerger, which hath four stations. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Submerging, the Most Submerging. God - there is no God but He, the Most Submerging, the Most Submerging.Say: God submergeth above every submerger. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can resist the sovereign power of His submergence. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Submerger, the All-Encompassing, the All-Pervading.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Ruby Essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: We all seek refuge with God lest we be among those who are submerged. Say: God will surely submerge those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, inasmuch as they are veiled from God their Lord.That is their submergence in the seas of fire, if they would but remember. Say: The degrees of your submergence cannot be numbered in the Book of God. The last thereof is the submergence of your bodies in water, yet God will surely deliver you at the time of your submergence if ye hold fast unto God.Verily We praise God Who hath delivered us upon the sea in every condition.

By God! He will verily save you when you are drowning, if you hold fast unto God. We praise God Who hath saved us in the sea in every condition and before every condition and after every condition. And when you witness this, you call upon God, your Lord. For God has angels in the water who will save you, and God has angels in the air who will save you, and God has angels with you who will protect you and save you in the grasp of God, and all act by His command. Say: The degrees of your drowning in your religion are beyond counting, if you would but briefly reflect. And when you veil yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest and His guides, likewise, if you would but briefly remember. And you do not transgress any of God's bounds except that you drown, though you perceive it not. Say: The ark whereby you shall be saved - that is the good-pleasure of God, and you all shall embark upon that ark. God will save you through His grace. Verily, there is no God but He, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. O companions of the ark! Place your trust in God, for verily you shall be saved. If you trust in God and then believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, you shall never drown in the sea, and God will protect you. And if you drown through what you have earned without God's good-pleasure, He will save you. And God is with you wheresoever you may be, to protect you from before you and from behind you, and from your right and your left, and from above your heads and beneath your feet, and from every direction that reaches you. And verily He is a mighty and transcendent King. O people of the ark! You embark by God and disembark by God. If you love, you shall not witness in the ark even a mustard seed's weight of sorrow. O people of ships! You shall embark by God and then disembark by God. If you love, you shall not witness therein even a mustard seed's weight of sorrow. And you do not embark by God except that you believe in and are certain of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: All besides God are affected by the action of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: All besides Him Whom God shall make manifest are affected by His command. This is the action of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Look ye unto all peoples, for all are affected by what God hath ordained when He revealed the Book unto him, by a command that hath been sent down from Him. This concerning yourselves, if you are affected by God's command. And how many who are acted upon in God's Book are better than those who act. And how many feminine actors in God's Book are better than those acted upon. This is the action of your mutual manifestation of one another according to what hath been ordained in the Book from God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God will manifest Himself through you unto yourselves and will act through you by His command. Verily, there is no God but He, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God hath created in those who are acted upon by the actors forty-six ornamental essences, and were God not to create in them those impregnable manifestations, they would not be acted upon. And God will manifest Himself unto them through themselves. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: The difference between the name of the actor and the acted upon is that number in God's Book. Were God not to create that number therein, how could the One manifested upon the throne of His revelation be equal?\[...\]

By God! These shall be revealed unto them through them, through their own selves - verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: The difference between the active and passive participles is that number in the Book of God. Were it not for that, God would not have created therein that number. How can that which is manifested upon the throne of His Revelation be equal to that which is revealed? And how can they be revealed? The revelation of revelation is at the time of the establishment of God's Cause. God showeth you the creation of your own selves that ye may be thankful. Say: God hath created in your women forty-six degrees of sensual pleasure above what He hath created in you, and were it not that God had created in them these degrees, neither would ye find rest in them nor would they find rest in you. All have been created by God's command and all are His worshippers. Say: Your glory lieth in your guidance if ye be guided by the guidance of God. And how many of those who are revealed are better than those who reveal, and how many of those who reveal are better than those who are revealed, and how many of those who reveal are like unto those who are revealed. God hath created in the Bayan whatsoever He hath willed by His command - verily there is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. O people of the Bayan! Submerge not yourselves in the seas of multiplicity while ye are veiled from the Primal Point. For all this multiplicity was created by a single point if ye return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and be of those who prostrate themselves before Him, even as ye began from the presence of the Primal Point and were of those who are devoutly obedient unto Him. When ye have recognized the Point of Unity, ye will have no need of multiplicity and will be among those who sail upon the Ark of Paradise. If ye are able never to be submerged, then mount the Ark of Names and Attributes that no trace of creation may be seen in you, for then ye will be safe upon that Ark, sailing upon the limitless ocean by God while ye seek guidance from God, your Lord. But ye comprehend not at this time. Believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and know God your Lord through what ye know of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and be of those who abide beneath the shadow of God. When ye have mounted the Ark of Glory upon the sea of Names while ye seek guidance from God your Lord - but if ye descend from that Ark and mount the ark of creation, even to its highest possible point, then there is no way for you except that ye shall be changed. Therefore look ye upon the thrones of Reality that ye may understand the Command of God. Then reflect upon the Prophets, the Successors, the Martyrs and the God-fearing, for verily they change with each Manifestation. But whoso seeketh guidance from God and mounteth the Ark of Names - all through Him turn unto God their Lord and change not from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end, all calling upon the names of God their Lord. Thus have We given you the essence of knowledge and wisdom that ye may not drown yourselves and that ye may hold fast unto God and mount the Ark of Names and Attributes. But deem not yourselves possessed of mere fancy, for your named reality is He Whom God shall make manifest if ye be of those who seek guidance through the names of God. Ye cannot deviate from around Him Whom God shall make manifest, and God hath created all His servants such that they shall never be joined with anything forever.

By God! He hath created all His servants such that they shall never be joined with aught else, and ye all stand firm through God's command. Verily, He is your Lord, your God, your King, and your Sovereign, Who causeth you to move by night and by day through His bidding. There is no God but I, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily, He Whom God shall make manifest is the First Veil of God. Beyond that Veil ye shall perceive naught but God, and beneath that Veil shall ye perceive all that appeareth from God. God is the Hidden, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, the Best-Beloved.If ye desire God, then ye must desire Him Whom God shall make manifest, and if ye wish to traverse the realm of Names, ye must rise up through the evidences of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye have made yourselves believers in Him Whom God shall make manifest. For God hath made your hearts the dawning-places of His Names in the Book, that ye may draw knowledge from them even as a mirror receiveth the light of the sun when turned toward it.We have taken refuge in God, besides Whom there is no God. His are all the best Names, both before and after, lest we remain fixed in any realm beneath the Names, or embark upon any ark other than the Ark of the Bayan. We ever seek proofs of God in all conditions. We shall surely embark upon the Ark of Names and bear witness that all who have been and shall be created are God's servants, and all worship Him.We seek protection in God lest we be veiled from God's good-pleasure by allowing ourselves to be drowned in servitude. By God! We shall surely enter into the ark of His good-pleasure, for through God are we ever saved in all conditions.This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Make mention of him who heard of thy Lord's Manifestation on the Day of Resurrection and was among the patient ones.O Murtada! We created thee, sustained thee, favored thee, and gave thee life that We might make Ourselves known to thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize. Thou hast worshipped God throughout thy life and wast among those who prostrated themselves before thy Lord. Thou didst strive between thyself and God, thy Lord, to be among the God-fearing. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those in that land who were God-fearing, yet thou didst not follow God's command nor seek guidance through God's guidance, though thou didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing.All that God revealed in Islam was not revealed save after the revelation of the Qur'an. The Qur'an, from Him, confirmeth all that was revealed therein, would that ye would reflect a little on what God hath revealed in truth. We nurtured those who were given the Qur'an for one thousand two hundred and seventy years that they might, on the day of Our manifestation, be assured of God's signs. Yet We found thee not among those who comprehended God's command in the Qur'an and were His worshippers.When thou didst hear God's command or beheld a sign from thy Lord, His proof was perfected unto thee, hadst thou been among the discerning ones. By thy having entered into thy religion aforetime shall God bring proof against thee, for thou wast veiled in the Bayan from what God revealed in truth from His presence. This is God's command, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.

When thou hearest the Command of God or beholdest a sign from among the signs of thy Lord, His proof hath been perfected unto thee, if thou be of them that perceive. Inasmuch as thou didst enter into thy religion aforetime, God will hold thee to account for having remained veiled in the Bayan from that which God hath sent down in truth. This is the Command of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.All have been gathered unto God their Lord, and thou art among the patient ones. All have been brought before God their Lord, and thou art among the silent ones. If thou hadst said "yea" when thou didst hear God's Command, it would have profited thee and would have saved thee on the Day of Resurrection. But by reason of what thou hast earned, not a grain's weight shall profit thee unless thou return unto God and become of them that seek forgiveness.Verily We shall cut off those who entered not into the Bayan, that those who were given the Bayan from their Lord might be exalted, they who were thankful in the days of God. If thou comprehendest God's Command on the Day of Resurrection and returnest unto God thy Lord and art of the sincere ones, perchance God will transform thy self through affirmation and forgive thee for having remained veiled in the days of God. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.Otherwise thou shalt surely die and enter the Fire, and naught of what thou hast earned shall profit thee. God thy Lord is independent of all worlds. And if thou hadst presented thyself before God and believed with the first believers, We would have raised up from thee one of the first believers who inherit Paradise from their Lord and who were witnesses over creation. But the matter hath been decreed, and those who comprehended have comprehended, and they have attained unto the presence of their Lord and entered their mansions in the Ridvan, wherein they now glorify their Lord with praise, remembering God their Lord.Thus have We tried thee and those who were given the Furqan when We distinguished between the truthful among them and those who were far removed from God's signs. And when the matter was decreed, that which was sent down from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, was made firm. There is no altering that which hath been sent down from God - all believe and are certain of it.Yea, if thou writest a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and chargeth God's sincere servants to deliver it unto Him, perchance God will pardon thee and transform negation into affirmation - a command from His presence. Verily there is no God but He, the One, the All-Bountiful.Verily, just as those who were given the Gospel failed to comprehend after God sent down the Furqan, those who were given the Furqan failed to comprehend after God sent down the Bayan. And We counsel thee, and all the believers, to have mercy upon thyself\[...\]

God will enrich you through His bounty, if ye place your trust in Him. Say: Verily God will cause vessels to sail upon the sea, and will hold them steady upon the waters, and will guide them whither He pleaseth by His command. He, verily, is All-Knowing, All-Seeing, All-Wise. Say: God will show you the wonders of His creation when ye are riding upon ships. How God causeth the vessels to move upon the sea and subdueth them through the agency of the angels of the ocean - this ye do not perceive.

He, verily, is cognizant of all things. Blessed are they who trade in pearls and in that which God hath created in the sea. These are they whose wealth God multiplieth beyond their wealth, and they shall receive double the reward of those who trade upon land. This is of God's bounty unto them, inasmuch as they toil upon the seas. God hath promised that He will cause them to enter His Paradise. They show kindness one to another while voyaging upon the seas. God hath ordained that should anyone's foot slip while aboard ship and fall into the sea, those who are on the vessel must hasten to rescue him. Say: Verily God will save those who are drowning in the sea through you, O ye who sail vessels, if ye hasten to fulfill God's command and make yourselves guides for the deliverance of God's servants, if ye worship Him. Ye shall remember God frequently upon the ship, that God may cause the winds to blow in the direction ye desire. Say: Verily God will guide every vessel and those within it to their desired destination through winds that He sendeth down from the treasuries of His command. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.

And ye shall leave intervals of five hours less four between each proclamation, that ye may witness in the number of the Gate that there is no God but I, the Sovereign, the Most Exalted. Ye shall begin at nightfall and then keep count. Ye shall make each day and night into five equal parts, neither adding a minute nor decreasing a mention ordained by God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. If ye are able and have a timepiece, then do so; otherwise do it according to your best reckoning. Then in the first part ye shall say "God is the Most Enriching" the number of the Unity, then "There is no God but God" likewise, then affirm your certitude. Then in the second part "God is the Most Knowing" the number of the Unity, then "There is no God but God" likewise, then affirm your certitude. Then in the third part "God is the Most Wise" the number of the Unity, then "There is no God but God" likewise, then affirm your certitude. Then in the fourth part "God is the Most Sovereign" the number of the Unity, then "There is no God but God" likewise, then affirm your certitude. Then in the letter Ha, the number of the Unity, "God is the Most Powerful" then "There is no God but God" likewise, then affirm your certitude. For verily your beginning is from God through the Primal Point in the Bayan - there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then your end is unto God inasmuch as ye shall return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.

And verily, concerning that which ye are able to encompass with knowledge, ye shall count in the first station: "God is more enriching!" the number of times of the Unity, followed by "There is no God but God!" a like number, then be ye assured. Then in the second station: "God is more knowing!" the number of times of the Unity, followed by "There is no God but God!" a like number, then be ye assured. Then in the third station: "God is more judging!" the number of times of the Unity, followed by "There is no God but God!" a like number, then be ye assured. Then in the fourth station: "God is more sovereign!" the number of times of the Unity, followed by "There is no God but God!" a like number, then be ye assured. Then in the Ha', the number of times of the Unity: "God is more powerful!" followed by "There is no God but God!" a like number, then be ye assured.Verily your beginning is from God through the Primal Point in the Bayan - there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. And your end is unto God, for ye shall return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and shall testify that there is no God but He, the Protector, the Beloved.Thus shall ye testify that unto God belongeth the Kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. All are His servants and all bow down before Him.O dwellers of the land! Thus shall ye proclaim the call to prayer. And whoso heareth not the voice of the muezzin is veiled from the Cause of his Lord. Let him hearken unto him who calleth to prayer by the leave of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly send down from the treasuries of His grace the sustenance of those who cause one among them to proclaim the call to prayer, and will grant them that which will gladden their hearts. Verily, there is no God but He, the All-Embracing, the All-Knowing.This is an epistle from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point - there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto this servant of Mine in the land of 'Ali that he may testify that there is no God but I, the Protector, the Beloved.O Muhsin! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make known unto thee Our Cause, that thou mayest be of them that recognize.Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and wast of the God-fearing, but when thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God and remained in thy land, thou wast veiled from that which We had formerly revealed. Lo! We created thee and all things that they might, when We make Ourselves known, be among them that recognize Us before Our presence. We have perfected Our proof against thee and against all who are on earth through that which We revealed in the First Book through an exalted and glorious Messenger. And when thou didst hear and didst not follow the Command of God, thou didst cause thyself to enter the fire with them that are veiled.Had thou said "Yea!" when thou didst hear the verses of God, it would have been better for thee than all thy worship of God throughout thy life when thou wast of the God-fearing. For nothing shall profit thee on the Day of Resurrection of what thou didst acquire in thy religion except that thou believe in God and His verses and be of them that are assured through His proof.This is the Path of God for all who are in the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them, and among all peoples. As thou didst follow the true religion before, follow thou the true religion hereafter, for all is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Verily He Who sent down the Qur'an unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God \[...\]

Verily He Who sent down the Furqan unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and established thereby whatsoever He willed in Islam, will assuredly send down the Bayan unto Him Whom ye were promised - your Guide, your Leader, your Mahdi, your Master, and whatsoever names of excellence by which ye make mention of Him. And verily that which God revealed unto Muhammad in twenty-three years, God will reveal unto Me in two days and two nights, when no command from His presence divideth between them. He, verily, hath power over all things. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! My Revelation is more wondrous than the Revelation of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, if ye be of them that ponder in the days of God. Behold how my Lord, among the unlettered ones, causeth Him to speak forth clear and manifest verses at which all the learned are powerless, and He shall assuredly manifest from His presence that which shall appear most speedily in the Book. There is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. If thou hadst believed in God thy Lord before all other believers, We would surely raise up through thee one greater in knowledge than thyself among God's witnesses unto all the worlds. We, verily, have power over all things. But the matter hath been decreed, and servants have hastened unto the command of their Lord, and have attained unto that which all shall envy. And they have tested servants who would not permit themselves to desire aught save their Lord's good-pleasure, and have departed from that wherein they were endued with insight, inasmuch as they entered not into the Bayan after God had revealed it unto them, and deemed themselves to be well-pleasing unto God. Nay, by no means! When they heard every Manifestation of God, they were tried and proved. Those who said "We believe in that which God hath revealed in the Bayan" - these are they whom God will deliver on the Day of Resurrection through His grace, and will cause them to enter among His believing servants. And those who said "Nay" - these hath God brought to naught, together with their works, and caused them to enter the Fire with them that are veiled. And regarding those who waited, the proof of thy Lord was completed against them when they heard the verses of God yet would not believe. Thinkest thou that thou art at the tomb of Ali and shalt be among the triumphant? Nay, by His life! We have returned him to his former life and sent him unto those upon that earth with an impregnable and mighty Book. All have veiled themselves from their Lord's command, and none among the worlds doth remember, save those whom God hath willed to make known unto Himself. These are they who have followed God's command and were among those assured of His signs. And God will surely question all who are on earth concerning that from which their learned ones have veiled them, for had they turned unto God, these would have turned also. But inasmuch as they veil them, they remain veiled. Therefore thou shouldst wish that thou hadst not learned from any knowledge that causeth thy Lord to cause anyone to enter the Fire, after God hath made known unto thee the truth through clear signs in a mighty and impregnable Book of truth. For unto thee shall return all that God hath ordained for those who follow thee after their death. Therefore show thou mercy unto thyself and then unto them by causing thyself to enter into a firm and true balance \[...\]

But they veil themselves by what they veil others. Therefore, desire thou not to learn from any knowledge that would cause thy Lord to cast anyone into the fire, after God hath revealed unto thee the truth through clear signs in an impregnable Book of Truth. Then unto thee shall return all that God hath ordained for those who follow thee after their death. Therefore, show mercy unto thyself and unto them by placing thyself within the firm balance of truth, and deliver those who follow thee even as God hath delivered thee through His clear signs. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.Reflect thou from the time thou didst recognize the true Faith throughout thy life until now - hast thou witnessed any proof from God besides the Qur'an whereby thou mightst attain certitude? Say: Glory be to God above what the speakers say! We have no proof besides the Book of God, and as we believed before, we shall surely believe in what God hath revealed in the Book thereafter - there is no doubt in it, all is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.If thou dost comprehend the Days of God and seek forgiveness from God, thy Lord, and art among the penitent ones, perchance God will transform thy fire into light, inasmuch as thou hast shown patience in the Days of God and considered thyself among the God-fearing. God created thee only for Our meeting. Look thou in the Qur'an and recite the third verse of the Surih of Thunder that thou mayest become certain of the meeting with thy Lord. This is incumbent upon thee above all that thou hast done in thy life, for this is what will yield fruit from all thy deeds on the Day of Resurrection if thou art among the sincere ones.We have mentioned thee as a favor from Our presence that thou mayest deliver thyself with the God-fearing on a Day when neither thy soul, nor thy deeds, nor all that is on earth, nor anyone in the worlds shall profit thee, except that thou come before God, thy Lord, with a pure and God-fearing heart. When the matter is concluded, then what hath been revealed from God - its verses have been made firm and there is no altering them from God - all are certain of them.Therefore, when thou rememberest, write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and seek forgiveness from God, thy Lord, therein, and command that what thou hast written be delivered unto Him. Perchance God will look upon it and pardon thee and forgive thee for having been veiled on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.And if thou dost not remember, thou shalt surely die and return to dust and enter the fire with those who enter therein. Therefore, show mercy unto thyself and deliver it before death cometh unto thee from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And remember all who desire God, their Lord, for verily We have been among those who remember in the Book. And We shall seek forgiveness from God, thy Lord, at all times, and before all times, and after all times, and We shall turn in repentance unto God from all things in every condition, and before every condition, and after every condition.The twenty-ninth Gate of the twenty-sixth Unity of the twenty-sixth Month of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Humiliator, and it hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Humiliating, the Most Humiliating. God, there is no God but He, the Most Humiliating, the Most Humiliating. Say: God is more humiliating than any possessor of humiliation. None in the heavens can escape from the dominion of His power of humiliation \[...\]

In His name there are four degrees. The first of the first:In the Name of God, the Most Lowly, the Most Lowly. There is no God but He, the Most Lowly, the Most Lowly.Say: God is more lowly than any possessor of lowliness. None can escape from the dominion of His sovereign lowliness, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Lowly, the Abaser, the Most Lowly.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will abase those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest through what hath been revealed in the Book, for they believe not in God. This is more severe than any fire, if ye be of them who are affected thereby. Therefore watch ye lest any soul be abased by God before Him Whom God shall make manifest while ye hear but are not affected. And closer than the twinkling of an eye ye shall not return unto God, your Lord. And whomsoever God abaseth shall not be saved. Therefore fear God, O all souls, for this is a declaration wherein ye all witness no good beneath its shadow. And should God reveal regarding any one of you the word "Yea," then beneath its shadow is all good, if ye be of them who comprehend this measure.Should ye spend all that is on earth, ye would not hear this unless ye hear it and believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. And should ye believe while possessing naught, ye shall hear this from God even as ye hear it from Him Whom God shall make manifest at every moment, and before every moment, and after every moment. If ye say regarding Him Whom God shall make manifest "Nay," then God shall speak concerning you the word "Nay," and naught of what ye have earned shall profit you, and after your death ye shall enter into the fire. And if ye say regarding Him Whom God shall make manifest "Yea," then God shall speak concerning you the word "Yea," and even if ye have earned naught of good, God shall transform it through His mercy into good, and shall forgive you your sins, and after your death ye shall enter into the Ridvan. And if ye intend to perform ablutions and offer prayers, then ye are absolved through what ye have already prayed.

Ye shall perform the prayer. But if ye are excused from it by virtue of what ye have already prayed, and when ye have learned the limits of what God hath commanded you, ye shall know. And if ye learn during your prayer, break it not off but complete it, and when ye have finished, recite what ye are commanded. This is of God's grace and mercy unto you, that ye may believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and be assured. And ye shall distinguish between what ye have forgotten and what ye perform over a number of years, for ye have been excused for what ye have acquired therein, that ye may not differ concerning God's decree. And when ye learn what hath escaped you of your deeds, ye shall make up for it, but not what ye have done besides that deed - a bounty from God and His mercy unto you, that ye may glorify your Lord with praise in the paradise of the Bayan and render thanks.Say: Your deeds in their essence are but a single deed, so make not some part of others, thereby making things difficult for yourselves, differing therein and filling your books with your fancies and complicated questions while remaining veiled from Him Who created you, sustained you, causeth you to die and will resurrect you on the Day of Resurrection. How many servants have been meticulous in the questions of their religion and pondered questions like those who were given the Furqan (Quran), yet were veiled by what they possessed and remained veiled from the Primal Point and what God revealed unto Him.Say: Your independent judgments and your imitation are not pleasing to your Lord if ye make yourselves witnesses of the Bayan. Let people learn from God's Book the commandments of their religion and its prohibitions, and call none unto yourselves, but rather call unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection. Whoso followeth other than God is as one who hath worshipped other than his Lord. Follow none but God and worship none but Him, and learn ye all from what God hath revealed, and prepare yourselves all for the day of your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.Say: What is to be fulfilled shall be fulfilled by your own selves. This is the essence of your knowledge concerning your fulfillment, so differ not therein if ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. It is prescribed for him who is raised up in Islam with this exalted and lofty Cause that his knowledge should encompass what sovereignty exists on earth, then what pertaineth to their houses and their books, then the extent of their dominions, then the number of their armies, then the justice of their treasuries, then what unique things they possess, that all may present what they have unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.Your knowledge of this sufficeth you, naught less than this, O people of the Bayan, and should God manifest for you what ye seek above the earth. For God hath written your limits, all in God's Book, and all are steadfast by His command. Say: Their signs are that they have coins struck in their names in their dominions. Ye can encompass them in knowledge if ye inquire of one another through your books, until no coin-holder remaineth on earth but ye encompass him in knowledge. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye shall be brought before God. This is that ye may prepare yourselves to exalt God's religion and possess what God hath permitted you, if ye are able.

And ye verily do comprehend it with knowledge. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye shall be brought before God. This is so that ye may be ready to exalt the religion of God, and then possess what God hath permitted you, if ye are able. Otherwise, your knowledge of this sufficeth you until God gathereth for you the means of what lieth with Him. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of the Bayan: Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Inform Abraham of what he hath earned on the Day of Resurrection, for verily We are They Who cause it to descend. O Abraham! We have created thee, sustained thee, tested thee, and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, when thou hearest Our verses, that thou mightest say: "Yea! Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee! Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds!"Thou hast worshipped God throughout thy life, yet on the Day of Resurrection, since thou wert veiled from saying "Yea!", thou hast tried thine own soul and hast not earned aught, even after We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those in thy land, that ye might be among those who believe in the signs of God. And hadst thou believed in God during the First Unity, God would assuredly have made thee among the foremost ones. But thou wert veiled, and the matter is finished, and thou shalt find no way thereunto except on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore watch over thyself that thou mayest be among those who respond. Go forth from your dwellings in pursuit of the standard of Truth, if ye be believers in God and His signs. And go forth from your dwellings toward Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may comprehend Him at the time of His appearance.Seek ye the Truth through what ye are capable of, not through what ye ponder regarding what hath been revealed in the Bayan, but rather through following those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, or by becoming among those who believed in Him before you, for they are guides unto the Truth, and the knowledge of Truth is their very essence, could ye but understand it. Make not the knowledge of Truth an imaginary thing in your hearts, for verily the knowledge of Truth is the very essence of those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they are assured of what God revealeth unto them.Since thou hast heard of the Manifestation of God, Our proof hath been completed against thee, as thou didst wait and didst not go forth from thy house for the sake of God, the King, the Truth, the Strong. And when thou didst witness a sign, Our proof was completed against thee, even as it was completed against thee in thy religion, nay, greater than this, if thou be of them who reflect. We reared thee in the Furqan for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, and revealed therein that none other than God could reveal verses like unto those revealed in the Furqan, that on the day thou shouldst behold a sign from Us, thou mightest remember it and say that all is from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.But when the matter was concluded concerning thee, thou didst cast thyself into the fire, and besides cutting down that tree that it might grow strong in the realm of divinity, We planted therein what We witnessed against thee, that thou mightest be among those who return unto God. May God transform thy fire into His light if thou returnest unto Him and becomest of the penitent ones.

Turn ye unto God and be among those who return unto Him. Perchance God will transform thy fire into His light if thou returnest unto Him and becomest of the penitent. And if the Cause be cut off from God's presence, then thou shalt find no path for thyself save that thou writest a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and entrustest it to the God-fearing servants of God that they may deliver it unto Him. Seek thou His forgiveness therein and repent of what thou hast wrought on the Day of Resurrection. Perchance God will pardon thee and forgive thee what thou hast wrought. He, verily, is the All-Pardoning, the Inaccessible, the Most Forgiving. Should all things enter into His mercy, naught would be diminished from the treasuries of His Command. He, verily, is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.But God shall judge with truth and shall give unto each thing its due - fire unto fire and light unto light. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Glorified be He Whose fire is light unto the God-fearing, and glorified be He Whose light is fire unto them that are veiled. Thus do We inform thee of all the knowledge of the Furqan and what hath been sent down in the Bayan. We, verily, are powerful over all things.Before God made thee to know thyself, thou didst regard thyself as one of the negations of the most inner affirmation, and wert not of them that remember. And hadst thou numbered thyself among them that followed the truth from God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal, perchance God would save thy soul on the Day of Resurrection even as they followed the truth and were of them that were certain of God's Command.Thus doth God show thee in the end of night both the negation and affirmation of the Furqan, both declaring: "We verily believed in what was revealed therein," and both following all its ordinances. But these are certain of God and His words, while those take from them who expound God's Book, that they may teach people what they ask about God's Book. This one hath followed the essences of knowledge and wisdom, while that one hath been veiled from the essences of knowledge and wisdom yet followed all God's ordinances, thinking himself among the God-fearing. This one rejecteth that one, and that one rejecteth this one. But God accepteth this one and rejecteth that one. He, verily, is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.O people of the Bayan! Let none among you reject another before the Sun of Eternity dawneth from its exalted heaven. We created you from one tree and as the fruits of one tree, that ye might find repose in one another. Look not upon others save as ye look upon yourselves, lest hatred appear among you whereby ye would be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. Be ye all one people, then return ye unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.For they who were veiled in that Resurrection through the hatred they showed one another, and who deemed themselves to be in the right and others in the wrong - these were seized on the Day of Resurrection by what had seized them in their night through their enmity, and were veiled from meeting their Lord inasmuch as they rejected one another in their night. O people of the Bayan! Perform such deeds as would cause God, your Lord, to be well-pleased with you, even as ye would cause Him Whom God shall make manifest to be well-pleased with you.

O people of the Bayan! You shall assuredly engage in deeds that please God, your Lord, through that which causes Him Whom God shall make manifest to be well-pleased with you. Do not acquire aught through your religion for your religion's sake, but rather make the most of the days of your lives and bequeath not unto the Day of Resurrection that which would grieve Him Whom God shall make manifest, even while you imagine that you do good. God will sustain you from the treasuries of His bounty if you are God-fearing in your religion. Make your religion purely for Him Whom God shall make manifest, for God your Lord, that you may, on the Day of Resurrection, attain salvation through God's religion. Be not veiled by the differences that appear among you in your night regarding your questions, your loftiness and lowliness, your nearness and remoteness from one another. We have counseled you with true counsel that you may hold fast unto it and thereby attain deliverance on the Day of Resurrection. Perchance while you are dwelling in your homes, Him Whom God shall make manifest will appear, and God desires to cause you to return unto Him just as God originated you from the Primal Point, while you all seek guidance through your own desires. Some of you have become proud through your religion, and others have become self-satisfied through your knowledge, each one of you taking something from the Bayan and thereby exalting yourselves. Have mercy on your own souls and be not veiled from a single soul, for you were originated from a single soul and unto it shall you return, even as you began, that you may attain unto all good. Verily, whosoever becomes veiled from the moment he hears God's Cause, being among your followers, his sin shall be upon you in the Book of God during your night, and then on the Day of Resurrection, your day. This is what God hath decreed in truth; verily, He is the best of judges. Therefore, wish not to learn of knowledge whereby you would cause a soul to enter the fire and inherit what God hath prepared for it, after having acquired knowledge whereby you might save one of the believers. Watch over yourselves, O people of the Bayan, lest you become veils unto yourselves through your knowledge, and that through your knowledge you may save others besides yourselves, that you may attain on the Day of Resurrection the reward of all things and protect yourselves and your followers from the veils of all things.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Lowly, the Most Lowly.Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, Thine the Might and the Omnipotence, Thine the Power and the Divinity, Thine the Strength and the Glory, Thine the Sovereignty and the Earthly Domain, Thine the Majesty and the Grandeur, Thine the Countenance and the Perfection, Thine the Beauty and the Grace, Thine the Strength and the Deeds, Thine the Mercy and the Bounty, Thine the Sovereignty and Justice, Thine the Similitude and the Examples, Thine the Stations and the Exaltation, Thine the Glory and the Invincibility, Thine the Power and the Loftiness, Thine the Sovereignty and the Might, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast never desired to abase any of Thy servants through the vastness of Thy mercy.

By Thy creation, Thou didst not desire to abase any of Thy servants through the vastness of Thy mercy and the encompassing nature of Thy bounty. And when Thou seest the veil of Thy creation to abase some that others might be reminded, do Thou, O my God, swiftly and soon abase him who believeth not in Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. And do Thou, O my God, graciously honor him who believeth in Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest with a glorious and exalted honor. For Thou hast ever existed before all things, and wilt continue after all things, and art concealed above all things, and subsistent after all things, and hidden to all things. Never hath anything escaped Thy knowledge, nor hath Thy power been rendered impotent by anything. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Independent, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Most Holy, the Everlasting, the Never-Ending, the Self-Dependent, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor offspring, nor hath there been any partner with Thee in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou created all things and ordained them in perfect measure. By Thy will hast Thou formed all things and fashioned them in perfect form. Thus hath the sovereignty of Thy signs been established upon a throne which Thou hast created from four pillars: from its first pillar emanate Thy communes, from its second pillar emanate Thy sermons, from its outward pillar emanate Thy knowledge, and from its inward pillar emanate Thy intimations, through the tongue of the inhabitants of the kingdom of Thy letters.Glorified and exalted art Thou! Thou art the One worthy of worship in truth, Thou art the One sought after in certainty, Thou art the One before Whom all prostrate themselves from time immemorial, Thou art the One praised from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art the One glorified in the sovereignty of might and majesty, and the King of sanctity and perfection. O God! Make Thine abasement to be upon him who worshippeth Thee not in the Bayan, and Thy glory and honor upon him who followeth Thy verses in the Bayan. For Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.In the Name of God, the Most Abasing, the Most Abasing! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His exaltation above all created things, and raised Himself in His elevation above all existing things, and made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, and made Himself supreme in His supremacy above all contingent things, and showed forth His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Most Abasing. He hath chosen an inaccessible Essence, a radiant Abstraction, a pure Simplicity, a camphorated Reality, an inaccessible Identity, and an exalted Being. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, and through it made Himself inaccessible from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Then there appeared from it what was within it and upon it, and thus was the universe filled, both unseen and seen, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen him for Himself and chosen for him primary and essential names, then immersed them in the boundless ocean of eternity. Thus was the universe filled, both unseen and seen, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Abasing, the Most Abasing! Praise be to God, there is none other God but Him, the Most Abasing.

In the Name of God, the Most Ignoble, the Most Ignoble!All praise be to God, besides Whom there is no other God, the Most Ignoble. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First Unity and upon those who resemble that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the First Unity. I testify that there is none to abase save God, exalted be His glory, and none to honor save Him, mighty be His might. Should you abase anyone who has not believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest, then your essence derives from that Name. Blessed art thou if thou makest thyself mirrors of God's deed - honoring whom He honors, abasing whom He abases, showing kindness through His mercy. And all this appears in that creation only when thou makest thy deeds exemplars of the deeds of Him Whom God shall make manifest. When thou hast done so, thou hast made thine essence an exemplar of God's deeds, as the First One's manifestation in creation is His most exalted veil, beyond which thou shalt discern none but Him. Therefore make thyself entirely mirrors reflecting Him Whom God shall make manifest, His deeds, His attributes, His names, His examples, His effulgences and His manifestations, turning with the Sun as a shadow turns with it. If thou hast made thyself thus, then verily thou art of the First Gate of the Unity...In the Name of God, the Most Orderly, the Most Orderly!God, there is no God but He, the Most Orderly, the Most Orderly. Say: God orders above all who order. None in the heavens or the earth or between them can withstand the dominion of His sovereign ordering. He creates what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Supreme Orderer, the All-Ordering, the All-Ordered. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. Praise be to God before Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient to Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Might and the Power, the Divine Realm and Dominion, the Strength and the Ruby Essence, the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who perisheth not, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is powerful over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God loveth that ye should write in the most orderly and balanced manner. Say: God loveth that ye should order all that concerneth you until nothing disordered remaineth upon the earth. Therefore cultivate the whole earth \[...\]

This is the Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Announce unto Ali before Naqi - for verily We are the Revealer - that O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, so that We might make Ourselves known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be of them that recognize. But We found thee not on the Day of Resurrection, after We had made Ourselves known unto thee, to be among them that recognize, nor didst thou hearken unto Our verses that thou mightest be of them that follow.When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, hadst thou said "yea," it would have been better for thee than all that thou hadst worshipped God throughout thy life, and thou wouldst have been among the sincere ones. But when thou didst hear and turn away, the proof of thy Lord was completed against thee, for thou didst not follow the Truth nor wert thou among them that were certain of the signs of God.Remember thyself and those with thee on that night when thou wert among them that were gathered in the house of Mahdi. Verily, We were there revealing. Thou didst mention one who teacheth the people the innermost knowledge of knowledge, and thou didst say what God loveth not to hear. Those who had attained the horizon of piety and were accounted among the people as zealous ones had judged and decreed that this one had transgressed the bounds of the Qur'an by teaching the people the mystery of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.After they had testified that he was none other than the essence of knowledge, they, not comprehending the Cause of God, judged that he was among them that had gone astray. Nay, nay! God beareth witness that there is no God but I. He hath followed the Truth with truth, and those who have judged against him are they who have strayed from the path of God. When We heard this, We rejected thee and said that all of them together had judged.When thou didst hear this, thou didst leave the house and desired to stir up sedition after what God had revealed aforetime in the Qur'an that it was worse than murder, yet thou wert not among them that remember. Say: The truth is established with God in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and He payeth no heed to the deeds of them who have turned away from the path of God, nor to what they utter.Thus doth God aid him who calleth unto Him in the last watches of the night by His own Self. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Hadst thou recognized Us on that night, thou wouldst have prostrated thyself before Us even as thou hadst prostrated throughout thy life.By Him Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them, We rejected thee, and the words of those among your great divines who judged without truth are more grievous in the sight of God than if We were to command the destruction of him who confronteth the Bestower of the Qur'an, and verily We are witness unto all things. Thinkest thou that throughout your night We were not ruling over you, or that We aid not them who follow the path of truth, or that We turn not back them who are veiled from the path of truth? \[...\]

And verily We have been witness to all things. Do ye imagine that during your long night We did not reign over you, or that We would not succor those who follow the path of truth, or that We would not deny those who are veiled from the path of truth? Nay, by God! We have been watchful over all things. Even as We shall judge on the Day of Resurrection, so do We judge in the night, though ye comprehend it not. Behold, when We make Ourselves known unto you and recite unto you Our verses, then do ye understand. We counsel thee to return unto God, thy Lord, and to be of those who seek forgiveness. And thou shalt seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, by the numbers of the All-Bountiful. For were We to will it, We would forgive them, for We have been forgiving. Look thou with what thou hast become certain in thy religion, if thou be of the discerning ones. Unless thou hast seen the Book of God and become certain of it as a revelation from the Lord of the worlds; and apart from this, whatsoever saying thou hast heard, thou canst not become certain of it if thou be of the discerning ones. What difference is there whether thou didst see the Furqan aforetime or beholdest this Book of the Bayan afterward, if thou be of the discerning ones? Yea, with God there is no difference therein, there is no Revealer save Him, and We all believe in all. But with thee, since servants follow thee that day by reason of terms thou hast learned in thy religion, and hast profited thereby, and exalted thyself thereby, and glorified thyself thereby, thou hast grown familiar therewith as though thou wert possessed of certain truth. Yet when thou beholdest these verses, as thou seest servants mock them, and servants believe not in them, or servants are not convinced of them, or servants follow them not, and servants are grieved thereby in the path of God from among those who did follow them - thou doubtest within thyself and questionest, yea questionest within thyself the verses of thy Lord without right before God or before thyself, if thou be of them that reflect. Otherwise, nay, by God! We have witnessed no difference when this hath been sent down from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Rather, thou shalt witness the power of God therein greater than what was revealed before in twenty-three years, for God shall reveal unto him afterward in three nights and days, for We have been the Revealer, and We have been powerful over that. Judge thou fairly by God how many servants have glorified themselves by Our names in the Furqan, yet on the day of Our manifestation, had they helped Us, We would not have been grieved. And how many servants have been so meticulous in the Furqan that they have split hairs finer than hair, and deemed themselves God-fearing in His good-pleasure. And how many servants have differed regarding questions of their religion and cited the sayings of their divines and found comfort in the conditions of their religious precautions, yet on that day they were veiled from the presence of God. O Ali-Qabl-i-Naqi! We created thee only for the day of meeting with Us and We sent down the Furqan for this, if thou be of the mindful ones. Recite thou the third verse of the Surih of Thunder, for We have been manifest. God hath commanded naught by His command nor forbidden aught in the Furqan save for the exaltation of Our mention before and after. How then art thou of the veiled ones?

There was no prohibition in the Qur'an except for the exaltation of Our mention, before and after; how then art thou among the veiled ones while thinking thyself to be among the sincere? Verily, We have a poem by one whose name equals the numerical value of "al-Wahhab" which is better than those whose names thou hast mentioned equaling the numerical value of "al-Wahhab." This one hath known his Lord and was among those who were certain of God's signs, while those others began in Islam but remained veiled from the day of their return unto God, their Lord. God hath created no soul except for the day of its return - O all things, be ye God-fearing! Verily the Cause hath been fulfilled, and the Day which thou heardst of but didst not return unto God, thou didst enter thyself among the veiled ones, as if thou hadst never worshipped God in any way and wert not among the perceiving ones. If thou returnest unto God, God will rectify all that thou hast acquired - verily He is the Beneficent, the Generous. This is easier for Us than the twinkling of an eye. We are, verily, the revealer of God's verses from His presence. When the Cause is fulfilled, thou shalt find no way unto God, and all the verses We have sent down have been made firm and detailed from the presence of an impregnable and mighty Knowledge. Yea, if thou writest a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seekest forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and art among the penitent ones, perchance God will transform thy negation into affirmation - verily He is the Forgiver, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Think not that those who were given the Qur'an understand what God intended therein, or that they comprehend what God hath willed. Consider those who were given the Gospel - how many servants believed in it and acted according to what was revealed therein, yet when God manifested the meaning of the Gospel and what He had intended therein, they became veiled from it. Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them with the meaning of what God had intended in the Gospel, yet they held fast to words of their own understanding and supposed they comprehended what God had intended in the Gospel. Had they understood what God had revealed therein, they would have recognized Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and would have been certain of Him. Likewise, those who were given the Qur'an - had they understood what God had intended therein, they would surely have followed the Truth from that which they were promised concerning Muhammad, their Qa'im, their Master, their Mahdi, their Guide, and whatsoever names most beautiful they mention in their books. Verily, the meaning of what God revealed in the Qur'an is what all were promised and what all await. Yet when He came to you with guidance and truth, behold, ye held fast to mere words and were veiled from their meaning. Be not veiled from God Who created you, sustained you, caused you to die, and gave you life. Verily, the day of Our manifestation is like unto the day of Muhammad, the Messenger of God - all are tested therein. Those who follow the truth from God, these are the sincere ones. These are they who followed the Qur'an and then what was revealed therein - these are the believers. Verily, those who are veiled from their Lord's proof on the Day of Resurrection have not understood a single letter of the Qur'an, nor of the traditions of the Qur'an, nor shall any of their deeds profit them.

None of their deeds shall profit them, and God shall bring to naught all that they have acquired. Verily He is just and wise. And God shall forgive them if they return and seek forgiveness, for verily He is the Forgiver, the Honored, the Generous. God hath indeed begun the creation of the Bayan through Him upon Whom God hath sent down the Bayan, that all may return unto God their Lord. They who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, these are they who have truly understood what God hath revealed in the Bayan, and these are the sincere ones. And they who believe not in Him at the time of His manifestation have not understood a single letter of the Bayan, even though they may believe in all that was revealed therein, and be convinced thereof, and act according thereunto. Say: The meaning of all that God hath revealed in the Bayan concerning every good and beloved name pertaineth to those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and who are assured of God and His verses. And the meaning of every name other than good that hath been revealed in the Bayan pertaineth to those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, though they may observe the limits set forth in the Bayan. Say: God will forgive you for your nights and will pardon you if ye believe on the Day of Resurrection. They who from the beginning when God revealed the Bayan until the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest believe in what was revealed therein - these are the companions of paradise and these are they who in the lofty chambers of paradise are exalted in the presence of God. But from the beginning of nine nine ten ten nine God shall manifest the Manifestation of His Self, whereupon all who are in the Bayan shall be tested. If they believe in God and then in Him Whom God shall make manifest, then these are they who in the Bayan believed not in God. And regarding your differences in your religious questions, it is the same to God whether ye act according to this or that, except that ye believe in God at the time of His manifestation. For then ye will have followed aforetime the good-pleasure of God, even if ye erred in your questions. And God desireth to reform your deeds and to forgive you and to guide you to the path of certain truth. They who differ concerning the Bayan in matters of their religion, these are they who are convinced. The truth lieth only with what He Whom God shall make manifest shall ordain concerning each of these matters, if ye hold fast unto Him. Even as We have explained your differences concerning the Qur'an in the first Book and have expounded what God intended as the very truth - verily We were witness unto all things. And soon will God make clear in the Bayan all the measures of your religion that ye may not differ after the Day of Resurrection in the Cause of God, and that ye may dwell upon one path, that ye may be delivered on the Day of Resurrection.The Second Chapter from the Twenty-seventh UnityThe twenty-seventh month of the year concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Concealer, which hath four stations.The First Gate: In the Name of God, the Most Concealing, the Most Concealing. God, there is no God but He, the Most Concealing, the Most Concealing. Say: God concealeth above every possessor of concealment. None in the heavens or on earth can escape from the dominion of His concealing power.

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves those who are in the heavens and those who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. And praise be to God, before Whom all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth and what lieth between them give glory. Say: All stand humbly before Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the kingdom and the dominion, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and sovereignty, then the dominion of earth. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Living One Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who oppresseth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not. Not a thing escapeth His grasp, whether in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will conceal your deeds on the Day of Resurrection if ye yourselves are ashamed and conceal one another's deeds and reveal them not. Say: God hath taken this name unto Himself that ye may remember yourselves through the remembrance of God and acquire the attributes wherewith God, your Lord, hath described Himself. And if anyone concealeth the deeds of another, God will surely conceal from him two thousand of his own deeds which God loveth not to be revealed. Verily He is the Concealer, the All-Hiding, the One Who covereth all things.And whoso revealeth the covering of another, God will surely remove his own covering, except if he seeketh forgiveness from God, his Lord, and becometh of those who conceal. This is an attribute which God, the Lord of all worlds, hath reserved for Himself. Therefore adorn yourselves therewith that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection. God commandeth you in this matter to the extent of your capacity, lest anyone be saddened in the Paradise of the Bayan while ye all rejoice in what God hath bestowed upon you.Say: Verily God will conceal your deeds during the days of your nights if ye, on the Day of Resurrection, conceal not the covering of your nights. Say: From the time God first revealed the Bayan until the time it is uplifted, ye abide beneath God's covering and veil, not distinguishing between negation and affirmation among yourselves, nor between fire and light in your essence, nor between the blessed and the wretched in their reality, and ye all exist within a single veil.When God manifesteth the Manifestation of His Self on the Day of Resurrection, then shall ye be made pure through Him. If ye accept God's Cause, then ye shall be mentioned in God's Book as being among those who affirm the Bayan. And if ye remain veiled, then ye shall be mentioned in God's Book as being among those who deny the Bayan.Therefore say "Yea" and conceal your essence, and say not "Nay" lest God remove His covering from you after He hath concealed you from the time He first revealed the Bayan until the Day of Resurrection, for this is from God's grace \[...\]

Say not 'Nay', lest God remove His veil from your souls, after God had veiled you from the time He sent down the Bayan until the Day of Resurrection. For this is of God's grace and mercy upon you - be ye thankful. And say: 'Praise be to God Who hath veiled us in the Bayan until the Day when He shall manifest the Manifestation of His Self, wherein we shall all be tested. Should we believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, then shall we emerge from the most glorious veil and enter the most exalted veil, and we shall remain concealed within God's protection and His veil. But should we remain veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, He will surely remove our veil after having veiled us throughout our nights and days before the Day of Resurrection - verily He is the All-Compelling, the Severe.'Glory be unto Thee, O God! Enable us to believe in Him Whom Thou shalt manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and to be among those who bow down before Him, lest Thou remove from us what Thou hast veiled through Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Most Concealing of concealers.This is an Epistle from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of the Bayan: Bear thou witness that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Inform him who was mentioned by the name of Muhammad aforetime, for verily We have been the Informer. O Muhammad-before-Husayn! We created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and gave thee life, that on this Day We might make thee know Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be of those who recognize. We made Our Self known unto thee through clear signs before which all the worlds are powerless. Yet We found thee not among those who recognize, nor heard We thee to be among those who remember.We have gathered together all those who were given the Furqan through a single command. When We made Our Self known unto them, declaring that there is no God but I, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, those who followed the signs of God from their Qa'im - these are the believers. And those who remained veiled from the Manifestation of God - these shall enter the fire. Unless they return unto God their Lord and seek forgiveness.When thou didst hear God's command, Our proof was completed against thee through what We sent down with the Messenger unto those in that land, and We were witness over all things. Through what thou didst believe before in thy religion, thou didst exalt thyself without right and deemed thyself among the God-fearing. We nurtured those who were given the Furqan for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, that perchance on the Day of God's Manifestation they might be saved through God's signs. And We revealed therein that none but God can send down a single verse, that perchance when they hear a verse they might remember and be guided thereby.From the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, We have been witness over thee. Thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life and deemed thyself among the sincere. Yet the tree of thy faith yielded not from thyself even the word 'yea'. How could it be otherwise, when beyond this thou sayest day and night 'Thee do we worship and Thee do we beseech for help'? Were We to judge thee, thou wouldst possess nothing, yet We have been the Concealer. Thou hast wasted thy life in what profiteth thee not even to the weight of a mustard seed, in principles thou hast invented or learned from those who imagine themselves to be zealous in God's religion. Thus hath the matter been concluded \[...\]

Indeed, We were the Concealers. Thou hast squandered thy life in that which profiteth thee not so much as a mustard seed of principles which thou hast either invented or learned from those who imagine themselves to be zealous in the religion of God. When thy term hath come to an end, then verily return unto God and be thou of those who seek forgiveness. Verily, the example of those who have heard of the Manifestation of God and believed not is like unto those who heard of the Manifestation of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime and persisted in their religion. Nay, these are further removed than those in the Book of God, did ye but reflect a little. Ponder then upon that which would establish thy religion, if thou wert of the discerning ones. Beyond that, all that is in Islam returneth unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and that which God revealed unto Him was not established except through the Furqan. This is that whereby God will adduce proof against all mankind on the Day of Resurrection. And beyond this, that which ye say hath not been attested by God like unto that which was revealed in the Furqan, did ye but reflect a little. Were God to send Me with iron-clad verses by which all would be convinced - yet God hath revealed greater than these and hath tested thereby those who were given the Furqan, though they perceive it not. Had not the verses which were revealed in the Furqan unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, been greater than the verses of all the Prophets combined, how would God abrogate thereby that which was revealed unto the Prophets aforetime? But ye reflect not upon the verses of God, neither do ye remember. Ye toil throughout your lives that ye might render null, through what God hath revealed in the Furqan, the good-pleasure of your Lord, and yet after God hath made Himself known unto you through His proof thereof, ye know Him not. How then do ye follow the good-pleasure of God while supposing that ye do good? And verily God will question thee concerning those who followed thee, while they are being tormented in the fire by thy fire. Thou didst acquire knowledge that thou mightest save some among the believers. Yet thou hast veiled thyself from the Manifestation of God and veiled those who followed thee. Had thou not acquired knowledge, none but thyself would enter the fire, if thou wert not of the believers. But what thou hast acquired We worship, and those who desire the path of truth follow thee that they might return unto thee while they remain veiled. Have mercy, then, upon thyself and upon them, and deliver them from that which they fear after their death, for We are the Bountiful Ones. If thou returnest unto Us, We shall surely transform thy negation into affirmation, for We are the Forgiving Ones. But if thou remainest veiled, thou harmest none save thyself and those who follow thee, and thou shalt surely die and find none beside God as protector or helper. Verily, those who were veiled from the Manifestation of God comprehended not a single letter of the Quran, nor aught of the religion of Islam. Otherwise they would not have veiled themselves from God Who created them, sustained them, caused them to die, and gave them life, through the practice of their religion while they supposed themselves to be working for God. How many verses have been revealed concerning your trial on the Day of Resurrection, as though ye read them not! And how many traditions have been revealed concerning your testing in the days of Our return, as though ye considered them not! Ye occupy your days with principles which ye have invented in your fundamentals\[...\]

How many traditions have been revealed concerning your testing during the days of Our return, yet you perceive them not! You occupy your days with principles you have invented in your fundamentals, when the fruit of all this should be that you seek the good pleasure of your Lord, while you comprehend but a single decree of God's purpose.God hath made Himself known unto you, yet you recognize Him not. Naught prevents you from God, your Lord, on the Day of Resurrection save the embellishments of your learning. Throughout your lives you strive for God's good pleasure, yet on the final day you remain veiled from God.When He wills, God can reveal the equivalent of the Qur'an in two days and two nights - that which you were all promised. Yet you know Him not, though you exhaust yourselves lifelong claiming to attain the good pleasure ordained in God's Book. Nay, nay! You have prided yourselves on Our names, supposing you were seeking Us. Yet when We made Ourselves known to you, you recognized Us not, desiring other than God day and night while imagining you worship God your Lord.Consider those who were given the Gospel - had they found a single tradition from Jesus's successors, they all would have believed and acted upon it. Yet when God manifested Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and revealed unto Him the Qur'an after what they had been promised, they heard of God's Manifestation but turned away. What was decreed was decreed against them, yet they remain waiting still, counting themselves among the virtuous.Similarly do those given the Qur'an exhaust themselves lifelong hoping to attain somewhat of God's good pleasure in their religion. They cling to traditions of their leaders, deeming themselves diligent. Yet after God revealed His proof and sent down verses and clear evidences, it was as though they heard not of God's Manifestation, following their vain desires without right, while thinking themselves sincere in their religion.O people of the Bayan! You are tested like those given the Qur'an. Have mercy on yourselves! You will find yourselves one day clinging to sayings of the witnesses of the Bayan, while God manifests His Cause with clear signs as you wander in search of a drop of living waters, like camels roaming hoping to possess something. God sends down oceans of living waters through Him Whom God shall make manifest, yet you protect not yourselves thereby, counting yourselves pious witnesses in your religion.Nay, nay! You are further removed than those given the Qur'an, then the Gospel, then all the Books. Watch over yourselves, for God's Cause shall come to you while you all supplicate for the day of God's Manifestation, then weep, yet when it comes to you, you remain patient and believe not.Grieve not - the Manifestation of your Lord can well dispense with your belief. Watch over yourselves lest you cause grief to anyone, for you shall be tested. And were We to reckon with you in the days before Our manifestation - you had entered yourself into the deepest negation after being among those remembered for affirming the Qur'an. You perceived not and counted yourself among the God-fearing. How often did you present yourself before a true and martyred Imam seeking the reward of those who attend there, thinking yourself among the lovers. Yet when God raised up Muhammad, then the true Imams, then the Gates of Guidance, had you attended but once \[...\]

Thou didst imagine thyself to be among the lovers. When God sent forth Muhammad, then the Imams of truth, then the Gates of guidance, hadst thou but once appeared before them and been among those who were certain of them, it would have been better for thee than all the occasions thou didst present thyself before the Imams of guidance throughout thy life, for the latter profiteth thee not except through the former, if thou art among the discerning ones, the discerning ones. Verily, thou didst not believe in the Primal Point; how then canst thou believe in those who have returned to the primal life? Therefore consider, for thou art among the dead. Have mercy on thyself and save it before death overtaketh thee, for God's mercy embraceth all things, and We were merciful unto thee. Consider by whom Ali was made a sublime Imam of truth. Was it by any other than the words of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, if thou art among the discerning ones? Similarly, regarding the Imams of guidance who came after him - had Muhammad, the Messenger of God, not declared, "These are your Imams after Me," would ye have held fast unto them? Moreover, consider what confirmeth the words of Muhammad from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, other than the Quran which God revealed unto him - a conclusive proof that rendereth the learned ones powerless. What aileth you that ye remember not the proofs of your religion, nor ponder upon them? Verily, the matter hath been decreed, yet thou hast not returned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. What We have revealed of clear verses hath been made firm; all shall be certain of them until the Day of Resurrection. If thou desirest to be among the saved ones, write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking forgiveness from God, thy Lord, for that from which thou wert veiled, and charge those who are sincere servants of God to deliver it into His presence when He appeareth. God may then pardon thee and forgive what We have witnessed concerning thee in the Bayan. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the Merciful. This is what We have counseled thee.The Fourth Gate of the Unity of All Believers: The twenty-seventh of the seventh month of the year concerning the knowledge of the name "The Returner," which hath four stations. The first, in the name of God, the Most Returning, the Most Returning. God! There is no God but He, the Most Returning, the Most Returning. Say: God is more returning than any possessor of return. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the power of His sovereign return. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Returner, the Returning, the Returned. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God, before Whom all in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them make mention. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Manifestation, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens nor in the earth.

Neither in the heavens nor on earth nor in what lies between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly cause you all to return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye would turn back yourselves. This would be better for you than all your works in the Bayan, would ye but reflect a little. If ye return, if ye return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, perchance He will forgive you your sins and pardon you and improve your deeds. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. But if ye return not unto Him and ascend unto the most exalted horizon, ye shall enter the Fire and shall not be helped.Say: O all souls, even as ye recognize your beginning from God, so shall ye recognize your end. For between these two there is a veil for you. God will cause you to comprehend what ye acquire between them. Verily, He is the All-Bestowing, the Most Subtle. But if ye comprehend your beginning yet comprehend not your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, it is as though ye comprehend not your beginning. How many servants comprehended their beginning from Jesus yet failed to comprehend their return unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God. What they comprehended of their beginning profited them not, nor do they remember.O people of the Bayan! Your beginning from the Primal Point will profit you not unless ye comprehend your return unto God, your Lord - that is, your return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and then unto the Exponents of His Cause, would ye but know. Let not your deeds from the day of your beginning to your return be rendered vain through being veiled from the day of your return unto God, your Lord, while ye perceive not.Say: The beginning of all things is from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: The return of all things is unto God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. No day of return but hath its beginning in a new creation, and no day of beginning but hath its return from an ancient creation. Blessed are they who return unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and are then created in a new creation. These are they who have comprehended the creation before them on their day of return, and then their new creation on their day of beginning. These are two mighty stations, two great days, two lofty mentions, two glorious seats, two resplendent Books.Say: Verily this Book is one wherein the creation of the Bayan returneth unto it - your return is mentioned - and wherein ye begin in another creation - your beginning is mentioned. God showeth you your deeds before the Day of Resurrection that ye may perchance prepare yourselves for that Day. This is a Book from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Announce unto Gawhar this mention from Our presence - verily, We are the Revealer. O Gawhar! We have created thee and provided for thee and favored thee and given thee life that on that Day thou mightest recognize Our Self through Our signs, if thou wouldst be of those who recognize. But when We made Our Self known unto thee through Our signs, We found thee not on the Day of Resurrection among those who remembered. How then couldst thou be among those who recognize? Thou hast worshipped God, thy Lord, throughout thy life in the hope that God would be pleased with thee \[...\]

How can you be among those who truly know? You have worshipped God, your Lord, throughout your life hoping that God would be pleased with you, yet We were not pleased with you. Say: The good-pleasure of God is not manifested except through the good-pleasure of Him Whom God hath sent down with the Bayan, would ye but reflect a little. Each soul imagines that they do good, but God's testimony concerning any soul will not be manifest except through what the Primal Point testifieth in the Book. This is what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath testified.This is a Day when thou shouldst take pride in thy faith and in His guidance which was vouchsafed thee aforetime amongst all peoples, through God's testimony concerning those who appeared before through His good-pleasure, while ye take pride in God's good-pleasure concerning those who know not your worth. Yet on the first day thou wert veiled from thy Lord's path, and hadst thou responded to God among the first ones, thou wouldst surely have possessed Paradise until the Day of Resurrection, as a bounty from God. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Had thou recognized God's Cause at the very beginning, God would have made thee the first of all creation in a new creation. But that which was ordained hath passed thee by, and now thou canst not attain unto this except by returning unto God and becoming of those who seek forgiveness. Thus thou canst not attain that first remembrance, but thou art remembered in thy station for having saved thyself on the Day of Resurrection and entered the Ridvan among the God-fearing.Behold how thou takest pride in the extent of thy knowledge, that thou hast learned from one who understood the meaning of the words of the true Imams and was among the believers. Yet after God made Himself known to thee, thou dost not take pride in His remembrance, nor in what God hath sent down to Him of verses and clear proofs that render all the worlds powerless.If thou art to wonder, then wonder at thyself - thou takest pride in one who believed in God in the darkest night, yet returnest not to God on the day of His manifestation, nor takest pride in what God sendeth down unto His Proof of decisive verses that all the eloquent ones are powerless to comprehend.When thou didst hear and didst not say "yea", Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed against all the worlds. Had thou said "yea" it would have been better for thee than saying from the beginning that hath no beginning until the time thou didst hear. Glory be to God, for this would have profited thee, and this is its effect, if thou art of those who glorify God.Consider thy religion - thou wert not certain about any command or prohibition except through what thou didst see in the Furqan from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. What then is the difference between what thou didst see in the Furqan before and this Book of the Bayan after, if thou art of the discerning ones? We sent down in the Furqan that none but God can send down a verse, that perchance those who were given the Furqan might remember. When they hear God's verses in His wondrous manifestation, they should believe in them and greatly magnify God's Cause. We found neither thee nor any of those who claim knowledge of inner meanings \[...\]

Not one of them who claim to have attained excellence in rhetoric and eloquence can understand, nor can ye understand, a single letter of the Qur'an and what God hath revealed therein, except that ye believe with certitude in God and His signs. Ye cannot know God save through knowing what God hath revealed unto Him Who expoundeth the divine words from His presence, that ye may be of them that believe. Consider those who were given the Gospel, how they believed in it and imagined they had grasped what God had intended, yet they comprehended not a single letter of what was revealed therein. Had they understood, they would have returned on the Day of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, to the true meaning of the Gospel through their faith in God and His signs revealed by Muhammad, the Apostle of God. That which God revealed aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, over twenty-three years, God will, if He so willeth, reveal unto your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi in but three days and nights, for verily He hath power over all things. Indeed, the Cause of God in the Manifestation of your Mahdi is more wondrous than the Cause of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, would ye but reflect upon it. God raised up Muhammad, the Apostle of God, from among the Arabs after he had lived forty years of his life, whilst ye all believe in him with certitude. Yet God hath manifested your Guide after but twenty-four years of his life, from among those who cannot even utter a single word of Arabic, nor do they comprehend it. Thus doth God manifest His Cause and establish the truth through His signs. Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Beloved. Hadst thou known the first to believe in God his Lord, thou wouldst have yearned to be but a thought among the thoughts of his mystery, and all who came before begin with his remembrance. They mention naught after mentioning God save his name, and all who were given the Qur'an stand firm in his Cause. Verily on the Day of Resurrection all shall be brought before God thy Lord. But hadst thou known Ahmad of old through having known God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved, and after him through having known God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, thou wouldst surely know God thy Lord at the time of His manifestation. Yet thou hast not grasped from this knowledge an essence whereby thou mightest be saved on the Day of Resurrection among the believers, save that thou hast learned words as craftsmen learn from their master what they practice in their craft. And those who have learned the words of God from these two servants, like those who learn from a craftsman - these earn their living through their crafts and those through goodly words. We have not sent them save with the truth, that they might teach you the knowledge of the inmost of the inmost for the Day when We shall be manifest in the outermost of the outer. We sent them not with principles wherein ye take pride, nor with matters ye witness among the learned. For these two are like the rain unto you - it profiteth you not thereby. We desired not to manifest them save for the essence of what We revealed in the Qur'an, that ye might believe in God and His signs at the time of His manifestation. And We have not witnessed that what We intended for you should bear fruit save in those whom none knoweth except God. These are they who have attained what they \[...\]

We have witnessed that what We intended for you shall bear fruit only in those whom none knoweth except God. These are they who have attained unto what they \[-ed\] from the bounty of their Lord, and who have entered the chambers of Paradise, and who do now rejoice in the presence of their Lord. Verily, the essence of all utterance is that thou shouldst return unto God, thy Lord, if thou desirest to be numbered among the guided ones. And thou shalt deliver those who follow thee from the fire, for We are indeed gracious. Otherwise, We were aforetime, and shall forever be, independent of all things. But since ye find God through Us, and in all circumstances upon Us do ye call, We have desired to deliver you on the Day of Resurrection and guide you unto the path of certain truth. This is a bounty from Our presence, for We are indeed gracious. Otherwise, all do believe in God and His signs in their religion, though they know not and understand not. And this shall profit them not unless they recognize God their Lord in the Bayan, and then become assured of the signs of God through His Proof. If thou dost comprehend thyself, this is from God's grace upon thee, and God is the best of the gracious ones. And if thou remainest veiled until death taketh thee, this is from God's justice as recorded in the Book, and God is the best of the just. If thou hast attained unto the days of God on the Day of Resurrection, then verily thou art among the triumphant. And if the matter be cut off and thou findest no path unto God thy Lord, and if thou rememberest, then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and counsel that the God-fearing servants of God should deliver it into His presence, that it may be spread before Him. Perchance God will forgive thee and pardon what thou didst acquire in the Furqan. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Generous, the Merciful. This is an epistle from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce thou these tidings from thy Lord, from Our presence, for verily We are the Revealer. O servant of God! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mayest be of them that know. God hath manifested all that was promised concerning Muhammad, their Qa'im, their Mahdi, their Guide, and whatsoever names of goodness they mention in His remembrance. And when thou didst hear God's Command and didst pause but the duration of saying "yea," thou didst enter thyself among those who were veiled from their Lord's path and who believe not in God and His signs. We have sent the Messengers and revealed the Books unto all who are on earth, and We are witness over all things. When thou didst hear a verse from thy Lord's verses or didst see \[them\], Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed aforetime in the Furqan, and We were indeed possessed of conclusive proof through what thou wert assured of in thy religion beforetime, if thou art of them that reflect. Save that thou didst see the Furqan and wert assured by it that this was from Muhammad, the Messenger of God - God revealed it unto him with guidance \[...\]

And I am certain that this is from Muhammad, the Messenger of God, which God hath sent down with guidance and truth, and all are powerless to produce the like thereof. Nay, all are powerless to produce even one verse that God hath revealed therein. And besides this, all that thou hast heard or seen in the Books returneth unto this, and naught is established before God in the Book save that which equateth with this decree, and verily We are cognizant of all things. We have revealed in the Qur'an that none besides God can reveal a single verse, that perchance they who have been given the Qur'an, when they hear a verse from their Lord's Testimony, may believe in God their Lord and be assured. Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and hast reckoned between thyself and God thy Lord that thou art among the sincere ones. Yet hadst thou responded to God thy Lord at the time of His manifestation, it would have been better for thee than all that thou hast acquired in thy life, if thou art of those who are endowed with insight. This will not profit thee on the Day of Resurrection, but if thou respondest to God thy Lord, it shall benefit thee as one who hath worshipped God his Lord from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end, and hath acquired naught save what pleaseth God, and was among the sincere ones. But the matter hath been decreed concerning thee, and what thou hast acquired shall not profit thee unless thou returnest unto God in a new creation. Thou didst glory in Our names aforetime in the Qur'an, but when We made Ourselves known unto thee, thou wert among the veiled ones. By that which thou didst adduce before from thy religion in the Qur'an, thy Lord God shall adduce against thee from that Book of the Bayan, so wait thou, for verily We are watching over thee. If thou desirest to save thyself, then be thou assured of this and guide those who follow thee that thou mayest deliver them from their fire, for We are gracious. And if thou desirest not to be guided on the Day of Resurrection by God thy Lord, then wait until thou diest and returnest to dust, for verily We are independent of all things. And if the matter be decreed from God, what I have set forth of verses in the Book hath been made firm, and thou canst not change what God hath witnessed, even if thou shouldst spend all that is on earth, and God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. God shall question thee concerning the veils of those who are veiled on the Day of Resurrection while they follow thee, with questions after thy death like those We asked thee on the Day of Resurrection during thy life, for verily We have power over all things. Yea, if thou rememberest after the matter hath been decreed, and writest unto Him Whom God shall make manifest a letter, and commandest that the sincere servants of God shall deliver thy letter unto Him, perchance God will transform thy negation into affirmation in recompense for having heard God's command on the Day of Resurrection and then having patience, and He will forgive what thou hast acquired and pardon thee through His grace and mercy, for He is verily the Forgiver, the Cherisher, the Merciful. We have reminded thee through this Book as a bounty from Our presence, for verily We are bountiful, that thou mayest save thyself and those who follow thee in the religion of God, and those who, being on that earth, hearken unto God's command and are guided thereby. This is a Book We have sent down in truth for those who \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Resplendent, the Most Resplendent!God is He besides Whom there is no God, the Most Resplendent, the Most Resplendent. Say: God is the Most Resplendent above every possessor of resplendence. None can withhold themselves from the dominion of His resplendent sovereignty, neither in the heavens, nor on earth, nor in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Destroyer, the Obliterator, the Annihilator.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.Praise be unto God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All stand in devotion before Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sublimity, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, neither in the heavens, nor on earth, nor in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall establish the truth with truth. He hath ever been the Establisher, the Confirmer, the True One.Say: Verily He Whom God shall make manifest shall establish the truth of those who believe in God and His signs, and these are they who are deemed truthful in the sight of God.Say: Verily He Whom God shall make manifest is too exalted to be mentioned thus, if ye would but ponder the Cause of God.Say: Verily He shall establish the Cause by His command and shall cause all that is not truth to perish by His command. God hath power over all things.If ye desire to distinguish truth from falsehood, then look unto those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and those who, at the time of His manifestation, believe not. For these are the embodiments of truth in the Book of God, and those are the embodiments of falsehood in the Book of God. Therefore fear ye God, lest ye place yourselves outside of truth after ye have been raised up in the Bayan in the name of truth.Say: Should He Whom God shall make manifest declare unto one who is God-fearing in the Bayan and is deemed truthful: "This is false"- then respond to Him, for this is the Word of God in the Bayan. God transmuteth light into fire when He willeth. Verily, He hath power over all things.And should He declare unto one whom ye regard not as truthful: "This is of the truth"- then harbor no doubts about it contrary to truth, for truth is created by His command, and verily God shall transmute fire into light when He willeth. Verily, He hath power over all things.Therefore consider how on the first day He established truth as truth \[...\]

And verily God changeth fire into light when He willeth. He, verily, is potent over all things. Look ye upon the first day wherein God made truth to be truth and falsehood to be falsehood; then on this Day of Resurrection ye distinguish between them. Be not veiled from this truth, lest ye be veiled from truth itself and from that which is beneath it, while ye recognize not their stations and their names. Consider ye those who were given the Gospel: their divines were, in their estimation, guides to the truth of the Gospel; yet when they were veiled from Muhammad, the Apostle of God, they altered the truth after having striven all their lives for Paradise. And when God made known unto them Paradise, lo, they entered not therein. Similarly did those who were given the Furqan act: they strove that God might cause them to enter, with the God-fearing, into His good pleasure; yet when God opened unto them all the gates of His good pleasure, lo, they entered not therein, but rather cast themselves into the fire, though they had sought refuge with God therefrom. Say: The balance of truth and falsehood appeareth not save on the Day of Resurrection, if ye be of them that love the truth and know it. And before the Day of Resurrection, through what hath been revealed in the Bayan, ye know the truth from aught else. How many are the servants who, on the Day of Resurrection, though deeming themselves to be in the right, shall be accounted by God as of the false, inasmuch as they have remained veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest and have failed to prostrate themselves before that for which they were created in the Book of God. We have made clear unto you the mention of the truth, that ye may be numbered among those who, from Him Whom God shall make manifest, recognize the guides of truth. Say: God is truth, and whatsoever is besides God is creation, and all are upheld by God's command from the Primal Point.This is an epistle from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved. Inform Muhammad-i-Taqi in the Book, for verily We are the Informer. Say: O Muhammad-i-Taqi! Verily We created thee, sustained thee, tested thee, and gave thee life, yea, brought thee to life that We might make known unto thee Our Self through Our verses, that thou mightest be of them that recognize. Yet when We made known unto thee Our Self through Our verses, thou didst not recognize and wert of the patient ones. Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and deemed thyself to be among the wisest of the profound, and thou sawest none beside thyself possessed of knowledge or wisdom, having attained in Islam such heights that thou didst reckon thyself among the learned. Had thou said "yea" when thou didst hear the mention of God, it would have been better for thee than all the worship thou didst offer unto thy Lord throughout thy life, hadst thou been of them that ponder the Cause of God. Thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life and wert among them that prostrate themselves before God. But thy heart's utterance of "yea" on the Day of Resurrection profiteth thee not. We have rendered thee and thy works as though thou hadst never been among the doers of good works. He whom thou didst teach was guided by God, and We made him to be among the learned ones. But since thou wert veiled, that which thou didst acquire in thy religion profiteth thee not, for all that thou didst acquire in thy religion was that thou mightest attain the good pleasure of God from His presence and be among the God-fearing. And verily the matter hath been decided concerning thee: thou hast changed the affirmation of thine own self into negation by remaining veiled, though God had gathered for thee the means of guidance.

Verily hath the matter been consummated concerning thee. Thou hast exchanged affirmation of thyself for negation, in that thou didst veil thyself after God had gathered for thee the means of guidance and made thee, above the earth of truth, to be of those who know. Servants who left their dwellings from the East and West of the earth stood firm to believe in God their Lord at His appearance, and came unto the Primal Point, and unto Him they did prostrate themselves.But thou, even though thou wert upon the land of the Primal Point, didst not recognize God at His manifestation, and after God's Cause was revealed thou wert not among those who remembered. It is as though thou didst not perceive that the Truth had come and God's Cause had appeared, and all were presenting before Him what they had earned.Verily We grieve for thee with profound grief, that thou didst labor for God throughout thy life and then squandered all of it by veiling thyself from thy Lord on the Day of Resurrection while supposing thyself to be among the sincere ones. Had thou believed in the Primal Point with the first believers, God would have made thee one of the guides and a testament to the Furqan. Verily He hath power over all things.But the matter hath been consummated beyond thy grasp. Those servants have inherited who migrated in the path of their Lord and left their dwellings in pursuit of the truth for God their Lord. Thus did God guide them to the Manifestation of His Self and caused them to know the truth from His presence - verily there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.When thou didst hear God's Cause, hadst thou been patient, thou wouldst have been among those who are questioned. Thou didst weary thyself and visit the Imams of Guidance, and wert among the sincere in God's religion. Yet thou didst veil thyself from Him Who created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die and gave thee life. And verily those whose resting places thou didst visit have descended upon thy land and prostrated themselves before God their Lord, and were among those who remembered Us.And when thou didst hear even a single verse, Our proof was completed against thee just as it was completed against all the worlds. And if thou didst not see a sign or hear one, how is it thou didst not seek the truth from those who believed, that they might cause thee to hear thy Lord's verses and to see thy Creator's words? God desireth to guide all beings. It is incumbent upon all beings to know their own selves according to truth, and upon all to seek recognition. It is incumbent upon truth to send down words of truth from His presence, and upon all to seek words of truth from their source, that they may thereby be guided.It is incumbent upon Him Whom God shall make manifest to make Himself known, and upon all to go forth from their dwellings and then to recognize Him through what He maketh known to them. It is incumbent upon Him Whom God shall make manifest to send down words of guidance from His presence, and upon all to possess those words and to ponder them and to reflect upon the creation of their souls, that they may thereby be saved on the Day of Resurrection.Say: Ye know not the truth nor the words of guidance, for ye seek and walk behind it. Whenever ye hear of a wondrous matter, present yourselves before its Manifestation and observe His words, that ye may not be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His appearance. And hadst thou followed the truth from those endowed with knowledge of the inmost of the inmost, God thy Lord would have saved thee on the Day of Resurrection. Verily He hath power over all things.

And if thou shouldst follow the truth from those who possess knowledge of the innermost mysteries, God thy Lord shall save thee on the Day of Resurrection. Verily He hath power over all things. God hath prohibited in the Bayan that anyone should judge another when he knoweth not the beginning and end of the matter, lest his judgment fall upon God his Lord while he deemeth himself among the righteous. O people of the Bayan! Should any servants inform you of one who hath claimed a Cause or revealed verses whose outward appearance befitteth none but God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, pass no judgment upon him ever, lest ye pass judgment upon Him Whom God shall make manifest while ye know not. Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is one from among you who shall make Himself known unto you on the Day of Resurrection. Therefore know ye God when His Manifestation maketh Himself known unto you, that ye may not stray from God's path. And even as God raised up the Messengers before the Point of the Bayan, so shall God raise up Him Whom God shall make manifest and then whomsoever He willeth thereafter. God hath power over all things. Make no mention of imaginary matters. We made not Ourself known unto you save through clear signs whereat all the world is powerless, and through words that confound the most learned sages. Therefore know ye Him Whom God shall make manifest through what He shall reveal unto you from your Lord of clear signs whereat all the world is powerless, that ye may be saved at the time of His appearance and may attain certitude in God and His signs. Thou hast given judgment without right in a way We are ashamed to mention, though thou didst reckon thyself in thy judgment among the sincere ones. Nay, by God! God is ashamed to mention it, how much more that He should be content that any of His creatures should pass judgment concerning Him. Therefore be vigilant, O people of the Bayan, that ye pass not judgment upon any who hath believed in God and His signs in the Bayan, judging him to be among those who have gone astray. For verily when ye pass such judgment, ye yourselves stray from the true religion. Yet it lieth not upon you to judge those who disobey God their Lord in their religion. Should God please, He would forgive them, and should He please, He would call them to account. God hath knowledge of all beings. God hath forbidden you concerning those who disobey God, that ye may be ashamed before those who are steadfast in their religion and pass not judgment. Nothing shall harm you, O divines of the Bayan, as much as passing judgment upon anyone without right while supposing within yourselves that ye judge by God's decree. Nay, again nay! Ye know not the stations of God's judgment, and were ye to know the stations of God's judgment, ye would not wrongfully pass judgment upon the Primal Point and His chosen ones. Through that which entered thy religion aforetime thou hast now departed from it, and verily God shall assuredly question thee concerning those who followed thee. God hath better knowledge of all beings. Thou didst not acquire knowledge save to deliver one of the believers, yet thou hast caused those who followed thee to enter the fire, for they were veiled from God's manifestation on the Day of Resurrection though they were among those who prostrated before Us. Say: God shall assuredly make manifest the truth from His presence.

But thou hast caused those who followed thee to enter the fire, for they remained veiled from the Manifestation of God on the Day of Resurrection, though they were among those who prostrated themselves before Us. Say: God shall distinguish the truth from His presence, and God is the All-Knowing, the Most Exalted, the Most High. Blessed are they whom God hath guided on the Day of Resurrection, and who are convinced of God's Cause. Upon them rest blessings and mercy from their Lord, and they are the triumphant ones. And if thou shouldst perceive the truth on the Day of Resurrection and become of those who return unto God, thy Lord, perchance God will transform thy negation into affirmation. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the Most Forgiving, the Forgiver. But if the matter is decreed, thou shalt find no way to guide others unto that path. What hath been revealed of clear verses hath been made firm, and God is the Preserver of all things. But if thou shouldst write a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and cause the sincere servants of God to deliver it unto Him, and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and then be of the steadfast ones - perchance God will transform thy fire into light and forgive thee what thou didst commit in the Furqan. He is verily the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous, the Most Merciful. And ye shall aid all in the religion of God that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may be aided in the presence of God. Judge not anyone when sorrow befalleth him, even though ye judge with truth. And ye shall aid those who are oppressed in the earth, inasmuch as ye have power to do so. Had the truth been followed from the first day, all upon thy land would have followed the truth from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. But since thou wert veiled, they too remained veiled, save those whom God chose to guide. These indeed have been raised above all mankind by God's command. Say: These are they who shall be made manifest. These are they who shall be victorious. These are they who shall be enriched. These are they who shall be the workers. These are they who shall be the rulers. These are they who shall be exalted. These are they who shall be guided. These are they who shall be the chosen ones. God shall send down upon those who have believed in the Bayan whatsoever they ask of His bounty. These are they who shall inherit Paradise, wherein they shall abide forever. Therein shall they have whatsoever their souls desire, and God shall bestow more upon them from His presence. Verily, there is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Therein shall they have what they love, what they wish, what they want. Therein shall they have whatsoever they ask of God's bounty. Therein shall they have whatsoever good God hath ordained in the Book, and they shall be independent of all things through God. These are they who shall be made independent through Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they shall have power through God, their Lord, over the earth and all that dwell therein. Nothing shall grieve them on the Day of Resurrection, and they shall be protected through God, their Lord, from whatsoever they wish. God shall aid them with all that He hath created and shall create, and shall preserve them and what He hath given them through the angels of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. And God hath power over all things.

In the name of God, the Most Active! The eighth chapter of Unit Twenty-Seven of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Active Name, which has four stations. The first in the first:In the name of God, the Most Active, the Most Active! God! There is no God but He, the Most Active, the Most Active! Say: God is the Most Active above every doer of deeds. None can withstand the sovereign might of His deeds, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Doing, the Active, the Powerful.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom bow down in devotion whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Glory, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall send down mercy from His presence that ye may be thankful in the days of God. Say: All are created by the deed of God. Say: Verily the deed is a quiescent creation which ye comprehend not. All that He Whom God shall make manifest shall do unto you, that is what God hath attributed unto Himself. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall act with might - ye are created by God's command. Say: Verily God shall act with power - ye begin through what is revealed in the Book. Say: The deed of God is what beginneth by His command, if ye but knew. Say: God is not joined with anything whether in the heavens or on earth or between them, and all that is attributed to Him Whom God shall make manifest is what God hath attributed to Himself, that ye may magnify the Cause of God at the time of its manifestation.Blessed are they who are affected by the deed of God - these are they who are affected by the deed of Him Whom God shall make manifest through what He revealeth unto them through themselves. Verily, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: All that ye do is by leave of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, as though ye act by the deed of God, the Protector, the Beloved. However, ye must watch over yourselves lest ye suppose that ye act through the deed of God.

Watch yourselves, lest ye imagine that ye are performing the work of God, for God hath not witnessed any acceptance from you. Like unto those who were given the Gospel, who imagine they are working through Jesus, the Spirit of God - yet after God sent Muhammad, the Apostle of God, they departed from what God had revealed unto them through His action, though they know it not.This is a Book from God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Give thou tidings unto Ali, for We are they that give tidings. O Ali! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and brought thee to life from a beginning that hath no beginning, until such time as We made thee to know Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be of them that know. We have made Our Self known unto thee through clear signs, at which all the worlds are powerless.Thou didst not remember in the days of God, and how couldst thou know God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting? When thou didst hear the Command of God and didst hesitate even to say "yea," Our proof was completed against thee, even as it was completed against all peoples. How didst thou follow the truth from those who followed it from the Primal Point, though they were but knowing servants? When thou didst hear a verse from Our verses, Our love was magnified upon thee, even as it was magnified in the Qur'an wherein We revealed that none other than God can produce a verse, though ye should all combine to do so.How then, after hearing a verse or seeing one, didst thou say "we are assured of it"? God hath taught us in the Qur'an that none other than God can produce a verse. Therefore there is no doubt that it was sent down from God, the Inaccessible, the All-Glorious, before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.Though thou didst reckon between thyself and God thy Lord that thou wert among the diligent ones, We did not witness in thee knowledge and wisdom. Thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life and didst acquire knowledge and wisdom thinking to save thyself on the Day of Resurrection, or any of the believers. Had thou said "yea" when thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, it would have been better for thee than all that thou didst perform in thy life, wert thou of them that ponder in the days of God.God hath not commanded religion, nor any of its ordinances, save that ye should believe in God, then in His signs, then in him upon whom God sendeth down the verses. But ye have immersed yourselves in the veils of your knowledge and have veiled your hearts from the essence of your knowledge and hearts, imagining that ye are sincere in God's religion. Yea, all peoples reckon between themselves and God that they do good. But inasmuch as they have veiled themselves from the proofs of God after the appearance of their Prophet, the proof of their Lord hath been completed against them, and in God's sight they do not good, even while they imagine they do good. Were they to ponder, they would be convinced that they do not good.

And when they imagine they are doing good, were they to reflect, they would be convinced that they do no good. Had you followed the Truth on the first day, We would surely have made you of those than whom none would be greater in knowledge, for verily We have power over all things. But the matter hath been decreed concerning thee and those who followed thee, and God beareth witness unto all the worlds. If thou sayest "yea," thou shalt be saved on the Day of Resurrection with the God-fearing ones, but thou hast persisted in thy religion and remembered God, thy Lord, though it profiteth thee not the measure of a date-stone that thou hast prostrated thyself before Him since the beginning that hath no beginning. Thou hast judged Him after what We had revealed in the Qur'an - ye judge not your Lord God. And there is no doubt that those who judge Him Whom God shall make manifest, they in truth judge God their Lord. Otherwise no soul would be able to judge God its Lord, and though ye know the proofs of God, ye are not able to judge them. Ye imagine in your religion that ye judge by God's command, yet before God ye judge Him Who created you and sustained you and causeth you to die, and ye perceive it not. If thou shouldst remember in the days of God and be of those who seek forgiveness, perchance God will change thy negation into affirmation. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, verily He is the Pardoning, the Forgiving, the Merciful. And if thou remainest veiled, thou and those who follow thee shall die, and your deeds shall profit you not. God hath distinguished between the Truth and you on the Day of Resurrection through what was revealed in the Bayan, if ye would but reflect a little. And if the matter is concluded, that which I have determined of the verses of God hath been expounded, and there is no altering them - all are assured of them. If thou rememberest after the matter is concluded and desire to be of the guided ones, then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and charge that the sincere servants of God should deliver it unto Him. Perchance God will forgive thee what thou didst aforetime in relation to the Qur'an and will change thy fire into light. Verily He is the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Beloved. He forgiveth whom He willeth of His servants. Verily He is the Pardoning, the Beloved. The Truth hath appeared in thy land and servants from the ends of the earth have comprehended it and have raised high their mention thereby among the worlds, but thou hast remained veiled, deeming thyself to be of the sincere ones. God hath not testified concerning thee to aught that would profit thee, though throughout thy life thou wert of those who prostrate themselves before God. Think not that thou knowest not the Primal Point nor art of those who prostrate themselves before Him. Can any soul deviate from His Cause? Nay, by His life! All are humble before Him. There is no soul but between it and its Lord it knoweth a God Who created it, \[sustained it,\] caused it to die and gave it life, and it is of those who worship Him. Then it surely knoweth our Prophet between it and God its Lord, Who hath ordained for it the paths of the true religion from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This is a sign that hath shone forth unto it from Him Whom God shall make manifest, and this is the Throne of God's Revelation from Him Whom God shall make manifest, wherefore all believe in Him and are assured through their knowledge of God their Lord, then between themselves unto God their Lord do they turn.

They are certain of what they know of God, their Lord, and turn towards God, their Lord. But when they veil themselves from the Manifestation of God that cometh after, that which they knew of the Manifestation of God before profiteth them not. Otherwise, all stand firm by the Command of God through the Primal Point. Whosoever knoweth one living in his religion, knoweth verily the Living One of the Bayan. All are submissive unto Him. Who can disdain the worship of his Lord, or veil himself from the First Unity in the Books of God? All know God, their Lord, through what God hath ordained for them, then through the names they possess they know the First Unity, then glorify, magnify, exalt and sanctify Him. This is a remembrance in the Book of God for those who veil themselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest, that they may know and be certain that they believe in Him, being assured of what they have believed in every Manifestation - in God, then His Messenger, then what God hath revealed unto His Messenger, then what hath been ordained through His Messenger of all things general and particular in their Books, that they may reckon. And what God reckoneth none other than Him can reckon. All stand firm by God's Command from Him. How can they reckon what God hath reckoned in His knowledge, when they were created for His Cause and are His worshippers? This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Unto him whose name equalleth the letters Qaf, Ya and Ta, and who is mentioned thereafter as Ali in the Book: Bear thou witness that there is no God but I, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make thee know Our Self through Our signs, that thou mayest be of them that know. God hath manifested your Qa'im, your Guide and your Mahdi from the land wherein thou wert among them that dwell. Servants from all parts of the earth have recognized Him and have received the messages of their Lord from Him, and they are assured of God's Command. When thou didst hear, Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed against all the worlds. How didst thou persist and not follow the Truth after the Truth came from God with clear signs in a mighty Book? For everyone who hath seen a sign or heard, the proof of his Lord is completed against him even as it was completed in the Qur'an, and God encompasseth all things. And if one heareth not or seeth not, God will surely question him with a mighty questioning. How didst thou not present thyself before God to hear the verses of thy Lord or seek from those who possess the signs and clear proofs, and who from the First Day believed in and were assured of God's Command? We have revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can send down a sign, that those who have been given the Qur'an may remember when they see a sign, then reflect, then testify. As the Qur'an was revealed in truth, the Bayan hath been revealed in truth, there is no doubt in it, all is from God.

We have indeed revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can send down a single verse, so that those who have been given the Qur'an may remember when they see a verse, then reflect, then bear witness. The Qur'an was revealed in truth, and the Bayan was revealed in truth - there is no doubt in it - all is from God, and we all believe in all. You have worshipped God your Lord in your lifetime and thought yourself to be among the sincere ones. And when you heard God's Cause, you said "Yea, we all believe in it." This will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection before God, and will cause you to enter a Paradise whose breadth is as the breadth of heaven and earth, wherein is created that which has no equal, no likeness, no peer, no companion, and no similitude. But because you followed what came before and strove throughout your life to be among the diligent ones, it will not benefit you on the Day of Resurrection before God. We desire not to judge except by what appears in the Book, and We are indeed cognizant of all things. Were We to question anyone with justice, none would be saved on the Day of Resurrection, for We have ever been bountiful. God has indeed favored those upon that land with an exalted and lofty glory, greater than the glory with which Ali was glorified through mention of the House and Mina. How many servants upon that land beseech the appearance of God, asking of God's grace by night and by day! Yet when God manifests the Truth, none of their leaders perceive it except those who are assured of God's Cause. Were We to mention what the divines upon that land have wrought, God's faithful servants could not bear to hear it. We are ashamed to mention it, while they are not ashamed of their deeds and think they do good. What they have wrought, they shall not perceive on the Day of Resurrection. It suffices them that they worshipped God their Lord by night and day, believing in His proof while it was hidden. But when God made known to them what they had believed in, they believed not. Had they not believed, We would have been content with them. But the matter has been decided between them and those who followed them, and all shall be rewarded according to their deeds. If before the Cause is raised up you wish to be among the mindful ones, then perceive what has passed from you, and deliver yourself and those who follow you from that which you will fear after your death. Otherwise, all shall die and then be gathered unto their Lord. All shall be rewarded for what they have earned. Those who have believed in God and then in what was revealed in the Qur'an - these shall enter Paradise. Those who veil themselves from God's manifestation - their deeds shall not profit them and they shall enter the fire. That which God revealed aforetime to Muhammad over twenty-three years, you all believe in and are certain of. Had God willed, He would have revealed to His Proof in a day and a night with no interval between them, for He has power over all things. Say: Were all upon the earth to gather together to produce the like of that Book, they would neither be able nor capable \[...\]

Say: If all who dwell on earth were to gather together to produce the like of that Book, they would be powerless to do so, even were they the most learned of men. And if thou shouldst wait until the matter is accomplished, thou wouldst find no way to that which hath been ordained and perfected in the verses of God. And if thou desirest to save thyself and those who follow thee, men and women, and those who seek guidance, then write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and charge that it be delivered unto Him by one of God's sincere servants. Perchance God may forgive thee on the Day of Resurrection for what hath been decreed from that time unto that day, of which We had no knowledge. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.God desireth naught for anyone save the truth from His presence, and God is independent of all creation. They who believe in God and His signs - these are they who shall themselves be saved from the fire. And they who believe not in God and His signs harm none save themselves, and God is independent of them and their deeds. All shall be rewarded on the Day of Resurrection according to what they have earned.The Ninth Gate of the Unity, with God, to be requited on the twenty-seventh day of the twenty-seventh month of the year, concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Eclipser, which hath four stations. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Eclipsing, the Most Eclipsing. God! There is no God but He, the Most Eclipsing, the Most Eclipsing. Say: God is the Most Eclipsing above all possessors of eclipse. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can resist the power of His sovereign eclipse. Verily, He is the Eclipser, the Eclipsing, the Eclipse-Wielding.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sapphire Nature, then the Sovereignty and the Human Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is powerful over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will cause the earth to swallow you if ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Verily God will cause the ground of your piety to be swallowed up if ye be not convinced of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do ye not consider those who were given the Book before you? They had built up their land in their religion, but when they turned away from the Manifestation of God thereafter, God caused their land to be swallowed up.

And between them there is none other God but Him, the All-Preserving, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God will cause the earth to be swallowed up beneath you if ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: Verily God will cause the lands of your piety to be swallowed up if ye be not convinced of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do ye not observe those who were given the Book before you? They had built up their land in their religion, but when they veiled themselves from the Manifestation of God that came after, God caused their land to be swallowed up and they returned to dust as they began, and they are, in the sight of God, in the fire, unhelped.Therefore watch yourselves, O people of the Bayan, lest God cause your land to be swallowed up because ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, yet cannot bear to remain on the land of those before you. For if ye remain steadfast upon the land of your religion, ye shall be swallowed up and shall receive no help, even as those before you remained steadfast. Watch yourselves, for on the Day of Resurrection God will surely transform the land of your knowledge into something else, howsoever ye may perceive the limits of God in your religion.Do ye not observe how God transformed through Muhammad the land of knowledge in the Gospel? God changed for them their saying "Jesus is the Prophet of God" to "Muhammad is the Messenger of God" and what was ordained thereafter. Thus doth God show you what ye shall witness after the Day of Resurrection in that Resurrection, that ye may prepare yourselves for the Day of God and then believe in and be convinced of Him Whom God shall make manifest.For this is your faith in Him Who hath appeared - there is no God but God, verily we all stand firm by God's command. The Messengers are all His servants, calling mankind unto God their Lord, and all are His worshippers. And verily the Books are the verses of God, recited unto you for the good pleasure of your Lord, that ye may remember throughout the days of your lives to act according to the Book in the sight of God.This is a Book from God, the All-Preserving, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Give thou tidings unto him who is guided in the Book, for We are the Bearer of Tidings. O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make Ourselves known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mayest be of them that recognize. God hath manifested the Truth there, yet thou hast not recognized God thy Lord inasmuch as thou didst not recognize the Primal Point in the Bayan, and wert not among them that remember in the days of God. And when thou didst hear, thou didst not say "Yea, verily we believe in God and in what God hath revealed upon that land." Thou hast departed from thy religion wherein thou wert, and thou shalt not be saved on the Day of Resurrection before God thy Lord amidst all worlds. Even as Our proof was perfected against thee in the Bayan - and verily We are cognizant of all things - thou didst not comprehend a single letter of the Quran, else thou wouldst have been guided by what God revealed in the Bayan, and We found thee not among them that remember. Thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life, yet when He made Himself known unto thee through Ali before Muhammad, thou wert among the veiled ones. Verily We are ashamed to mention what thou hast earned after thou wert ashamed of what thou hadst earned.

We found thee among those who remember. Thou didst worship God, thy Lord, throughout thy life; then, when He made Himself known unto thee through Ali before Muhammad, thou wert among those who were veiled. Verily, We are loath to mention what thou didst commit after thou wert ashamed of what thou hadst committed, while deeming thyself to be among the diligent ones. Thou didst worship God, thy Lord, and wert among those who prostrated themselves before Us. And thou didst pride thyself in Our names and deemed thyself to be among the sincere ones. But when We made Ourselves known unto thee, thou didst pass judgment on those who had recognized God, their Lord, contrary to what We had revealed in the Book, after We had forbidden thee and all those who were given the Furqan to submit to the judgment of those who judge not according to what God hath revealed, for they are, in God's sight, among the wrongdoers. And thou, according to what We revealed in the Furqan, hast departed from thy religion and art among those who are tormented in the fire. And in thy religion thou hast judged contrary to what God hath revealed, and it behooveth Us not to admit thee into the Bayan and pronounce judgment upon thee therein, for verily We are watchful over all things. And God will assuredly chastise thee with the chastisement of all who were veiled in the Bayan until the Day of Resurrection, inasmuch as thou hast caused sedition in the Bayan. Had the sedition not occurred, none of the believers would have grieved, nor would anyone thereafter have followed any path save the path of truth. But thou didst bring about that which God did not permit thee, while deeming thyself to be among the sincere ones in God's religion. Nay, by God! Had We known that one like thee would appear in Islam, We would have revealed a name for thee in the Furqan and would have decreed thy unbelief, that none among all the peoples might follow thee. After We revealed thy name with every untrue name that We had revealed in the Furqan, and commanded thee and every soul not to follow aught but the truth - and We intended none other than thee - how dost thou not feel ashamed before those of thine own kind, if thou art among those who remember? Consider thy beginning: thou wert created from clay and unto clay shalt thou return. And between these two states of clay, thou hast accomplished naught save that which hath caused God to torment all the peoples. This is the fruit of thy knowledge and thy diligence before thy Lord, after thou wert among those who worshipped Us night and day. We have forbidden in the Bayan that anyone should pass judgment upon another in matters of religion \[and We admonish thee\] by this in the Bayan, that thou mayest be ashamed thereof and be among the silent ones. And should anyone in the Bayan commit the like of what thou hast committed - and of this there is no doubt - thou wouldst claim guidance and faith, even though thou art among the unbelievers. Were We to mention what thou hast committed, all things would curse thee for what thou hast wrought, while thou didst deem thyself to be among the doers of good. But sufficient for thee is God's curse upon thee. Whomsoever God doth curse, all things will assuredly curse, even as thou thyself on that day didst curse him who denied Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime. Yet thou art even more remote than he, for the former did manifest faith in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, whereas thou hast not manifested faith in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, in his brethren. And verily, he who opposed Moses, when he saw a sign, did bring forth something of sorcery \[...\]

Verily, he who opposed Moses did so after witnessing a sign, thinking it mere sorcery. Yet thou, even after witnessing what thou hast seen, hast not produced the like thereof. This is thy station with God, though thou and those who follow thee count yourselves among the righteous. I counsel thee and those who have been given the Bayan: if ye desire to oppose anyone, oppose him with the like of what he bringeth forth, not with actions that the faithful servants of God would be ashamed to mention. We have forbidden those who have been given the Bayan to dispute with Him Whom God shall make manifest except through that which He brings forth. Beyond this, whether in word, deed, or writing, We have forbidden it to all the worlds, that ye may feel ashamed in the Bayan and not pursue your desires in the presence of God's verses.Glory be unto Thee, O God! Chastise him with a severe chastisement and seize him with a swift seizure. Question him concerning all from which he was veiled in Islam, for verily Thou art knowing of all things. Show him the recompense of what he hath wrought as befits Thy justice, for Thou art powerful over all things. Cause him to be forgotten and cast him into the fire with those who enter therein. This is in measure with what he earned in the Qur'an by transgressing God's bounds, being among those who are far removed.Yet if thou believest in God and His verses in the Bayan, God will transform all thy fire into light and will forgive what thou hast wrought, shouldst thou return unto God and be among the sincere ones. And if the matter is decreed, these verses which I have detailed are decisive and there is no altering them from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. If thou desirest salvation in the Bayan, write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and charge that it be delivered to Him by one of the believers, having sought God's forgiveness therein. Perchance God will transform thy fire into light, for He is indeed the Forgiving, the Pardoning, the Merciful.However, what thou didst earn in the Qur'an prevents thee from believing in God, thy Lord, in the Bayan. We have sent down these verses for those who wish to remember in the days of God and who return unto God, their Lord, then repent and seek forgiveness. But God hath willed that every soul should believe in God, its Lord, and in what He hath ordained, yet people of their own accord refuse. God will judge between His servants with truth on the Day of Resurrection, for He is the best of judges.We counsel thee to don the robe of modesty, that thou mayest not cause grief to any soul forever. For hadst thou not earned what thou didst earn, God would not have sent down such a book upon thee, causing all who read it to curse thee until the Day of Resurrection. Fear God with true fear, lest thou be veiled on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest from God Who created thee, sustained thee, causeth thee to die and giveth thee life, by being veiled from a Soul Who showeth forth clear signs from His presence, that thou mayest be among those who are saved on that day.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Remember thou him who is remembered by the name of Husayn in that land, for verily We are ever mindful. O thou! We have created thee \[...\]

This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Remember thou him who is remembered by the name of Husayn in that land, for verily We are ever mindful.O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and brought thee to life from a beginning that hath no beginning, until such time as We made Ourselves known unto thee, that thou mightest be of them that know Us. When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed against all the peoples. All that thou hast worshipped God throughout thy life will profit thee not a grain of mustard seed, for thou wert not among His true worshippers.If thou didst worship God thy Lord to follow the Primal Point and His deputies, say: Glory be to God above that which thou didst worship! If thou hadst worshipped God my Lord, thou wouldst have followed the Primal Point and been among those who prostrate themselves before Him.Thou hast toiled throughout thy life and studied, and deemed thyself among the learned ones. Yet in thy religion thou hast transgressed the bounds set by God and become among those who have departed from their faith. We need not demonstrate thy rejection in the Bayan, for thy rejection in the Qur'an sufficeth, if thou art of them that remember.We created thee for the day of meeting with Us, yet when thou didst appear before God thy Lord, thou desired to be among those whom We are ashamed to mention, though thou wert among those who prostrated before Us night and day.Verily We have revealed in the Qur'an that the just ones are they who judge with truth and who, when they hear a statement from anyone, respond to it with a true word like unto that which they have heard. Yet We have not witnessed among you anyone from among the just ones. When We have advanced a Cause and established it with clear signs that render the world impotent, if ye were just in your religion, ye would say unto yourselves or unto him who hath not produced a sign: "Bring forth the like of this proof that we may judge with truth, for we are among the just ones."Say: Praise be to God that We have not witnessed any just one among you, save that ye have all transgressed the bounds set by God, if ye were truly just. If any among you should say that someone hath brought a Book and ye say "bring thou a Book that we may judge between them," otherwise God hath not permitted us to judge without justice, and we seek refuge with God our Lord, the All-Merciful, from that which He desireth not.Thou didst reckon thyself among the sincere ones in God's religion, yet thou didst desire to slay the Primal Point, not knowing that this would return unto God, though thou wert among His worshippers. God did prevent thee and seize thee, then forsake thee, then curse thee, then cause thee to enter the Fire with them that enter therein. After We had forbidden in the Qur'an that ye should appeal to the judgment of the oppressors, thou didst appeal unto him and desired to seek his help in that which God had forbidden thee and all the believers. Therefore have We cut thee off and banished thee, and We witness no good in thee among all the worlds.

We have witnessed no good from thee in all the worlds. In God's knowledge, none is more remote than he who hath slain the letter Ha' in the Qur'an, and God will never deliver him from the fire. And thou art more remote than he, for he committed his deed behind the veil of Ha', while thou hast desired to act behind the veil of the First One. God hath cursed thee with thy own will with a grievous curse. We do not make him thy example; rather, thou art his example. Verily, thou art more remote than those who outwardly professed Islam through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, while in their hearts they believed not - nay, more remote than he who confronted Moses and opposed the Truth with sorcery. Yet thou hast not done even this much, though thou hast deemed thyself among the protected divines. The punishment of those who follow thee shall return unto thee, and God is the best of judges. Should thou return unto God in the Bayan, God is able to transform the fire into light; verily, He hath power over all things. And if the matter be decided, thou shalt write to Him Whom God shall make manifest and seek forgiveness from God, thy Lord, in Him, as recompense for what thou hast wrongfully desired. And thou shalt enjoin that God's sincere servants shall deliver it unto Him. Perchance God will transform the fire into light in the Book; verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Generous. All that thou hast wept over the letter Ha' in the Qur'an shall reach thee in thy weeping, for thou art more remote than he who slew it, and hadst thou lived in his days, thou wouldst have been among those who issued the decree against him. Even as thou hast desired for Him Who createth by His word, like unto that veil, thus shouldst thou watch over thyself on the Day of Resurrection lest thou be among the afflicted. Verily, We are supreme over all things. Verily, We are manifest above all things. Verily, We are independent of all things. Verily, We are powerful over all things. Verily, We are exalted above all things. The tenth chapter of the Vahid concerning the knowledge of the name "the Thread" and it hath four stations. The first in the first. In the Name of God, the Most Threaded, the Most Threaded. God! There is no God but He, the Most Threaded, the Most Threaded. Say: God is the Most Threaded above all possessors of threads. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the sovereignty of His threading. Verily, He is the All-Threading, the Thread-Maker, the Thread-Creator. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them make mention. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him. God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who perisheth not, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens \[...\]

Blessed be He from Whose grasp nothing escapes, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them! He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them! There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and in what lieth between them! There is none other God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will verily guide you along the paths of glory and guidance, if ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. O people of the Bayan! Create not such things as those who were given the Furqan created concerning the strange matters of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and those who were witnesses after Him, lest ye be veiled thereby on the Day of Resurrection from Him Whom God shall make manifest, while thinking that ye do good. The proof consisteth solely in the verses of God, which suffice all the worlds. Draw not your proofs from aught else, if ye be of them that are assured. Indeed, all other matters are gathered beneath its shadow, did ye but know.Draw ye your proofs from what hath been revealed in the Bayan, yet ye enter not into what We have revealed concerning the exposition of the Furqan in the Bayan. We have manifested Our Cause in the letter Ha according to what was revealed in the Furqan, that We might test you and that ye might bear witness concerning your Cause - whether ye are sincere in your religion. We have borne witness against you, for ye understand not any matter, nor do ye comprehend aught from the Book of God. Nay, ye have learned but words devoid of meaning, and from these and their meaning ye are veiled from God, your Lord.Let not your knowledge divide you, lest ye be veiled from its essence, for your entire religion resteth upon a single proof, around which ye circle. When God manifesteth that proof, He reneweth your religion as He pleaseth - that is the Day of Resurrection. Be not veiled from the proof of your religion by the conditions of your religion. Had God not revealed the Bayan, would any matter have been established? Even so was it aforetime with the Furqan, if ye would but remember a little.When God revealed the Furqan unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and established thereby that He was verily a Messenger from God, concerning which there is no doubt, all believed in Him. God established what He willed and appointed those in authority through His word in the Faith as He pleased by His command. Verily, He was All-Knowing, All-Wise. And He dismissed the monks and those who were sincere in their religion. Therefore watch over yourselves lest ye traverse the path of fire while thinking ye walk in the path of paradise.Similarly, at this time, all who were given the Furqan think they walk in paradise, while they all walk in fire, save those who have entered themselves into the Bayan. These are they whose numbers equal not the number of all things, and they are but a small band. Two sovereigns in India await the manifestation of the Truth, then one in Bukhara, one in Herat, one among the Persians, and one among the Romans - all of whom were given the Furqan, and all are promised concerning their Qa'im whom God shall make manifest. Yet after God manifesteth the Truth, perchance they hear not, so how can they believe in Him? Therefore ponder ye in all your affairs with deliberation, save in your religion \[...\]

After God made manifest the Truth, they surely heard not; how then can they believe in Him? Therefore, in all thine affairs exercise deliberation save in matters of thy Faith. Let it be your way, O possessors of dominion in every land, to have those who will bring you the Books, that perchance on the Day of God's Manifestation, the Book of Truth may reach you by God's leave, and thereby shall ye deliver your souls, and attain unto the presence of God, your Lord. Yet at that time ye shall lament and weep, while the Truth beholdeth Himself alone, with none to help Him save God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And they who point to Him, these are His helpers.How much of God's dominion do ye expend in your schemes! Yet if ye were to expend the minutest measure of what ye expend for the welfare of your Faith, perchance ye would find a way to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and would appear at the time of God's Manifestation through the manifestation of Truth, and would present yourselves before God. Then would ye prostrate before Him as ye prostrate in absence and presence, and would aid Him as ye desire to aid the Truth in its concealment, at the time of its manifestation before Him.God will surely teach you the paths of your salvation, yet ye follow your own desires. If ye would hold fast to God's command, ye shall be saved. This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Announce unto the Mahdi in the land of Qaf, for verily We are the Announcers. O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, that thou mightest recognize Our Self through Our signs, if thou be of them that know. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book and made known to thee Our Self through the First One, yet We found thee not to be among those who recognize.Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life, and if thou sayest 'yea', it will not profit thee in what thou seekest from God. But thou hast not truly worshipped God and hast grown rigid therein, supposing thyself to be among the diligent, and between thee and God thy Lord thou hast deemed thyself among the sincere. Not the weight of a date-stone will it profit thee. And when thou didst behold God's signs, Our proof was completed against thee just as it was completed against thee in the Qur'an, if thou be of the discerning ones.Consider in thy Faith: thou hast seen nothing, neither proof nor wondrous sign, save that thou hast seen the Qur'an, a Book from God, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. Thou wert convinced by it and didst count thyself among the believers. What then is the difference to thee between when thou didst see the Qur'an and when thou didst see the First Book from the Messenger, if thou wouldst reflect a little? If thou sayest regarding it what the ancients said, God thy Lord hath answered thee in the Qur'an, and likewise will God thy Lord answer thee in the Bayan, if thou be of the mindful ones.Yea, the difference when thou didst see the Qur'an was that thou didst witness all believers certain of it, while when thou didst see the Bayan thou witnessed none save the Messenger. If thou wert discerning, there would be no difference between them. Either thou followest not what the people see, but rather what was revealed in the Qur'an, whether all believe in it or not.

And when thou art of those possessed of insight, there is no difference between them. Follow not what the people behold, but rather what hath been revealed in the Furqan, whether all believe and are assured thereof, or whether they believe not and are not assured. For the difference hath been removed when thou hast witnessed the Furqan to be the Furqan, and when thou hast witnessed the Bayan - all is from God and we all believe in all. We have revealed in the Furqan that none other than God can reveal a single verse, that perchance they who have been given the Furqan, when they behold a verse, may remember and be assured, and present themselves forthwith before their Lord's proof, then believe and doubt not that wherein they formerly believed and were assured through the Furqan. But We found that what We planted in the hearts of those who were given Islam as the proof of their religion bore no fruit, save that they clung to what they had invented of their sciences and were veiled from the proof of their religion, supposing they would not be tested. Nay! We have tested them when We decreed their destruction in their faith and in the assurance of those who seek proofs from God their Lord. These are they who have been raised up unto God their Lord, and in the horizon of holiness do they soar. And verily the fire of all who are on earth shall return unto thee in recompense for what thou didst endure in meeting thy Lord, after thou wast created for Him and didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing. And what was revealed of the verses hath been confirmed by God, and there is no changing them - all shall be assured thereof until the Day of Resurrection. Yea, thou shalt return unto God and seek forgiveness for that from which thou wast veiled in the days of God. God may perchance transform thy fire into light - verily He is the Forgiving, the Pardoning. And when the matter is decreed, thou shalt find no way unto that. Therefore write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest a book of mighty grace, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and counsel that the sincere servants of God should convey it unto Him, that it may be spread before God. God may perchance transform thy soul through affirmation and forgive thee in the Book - verily He is the Protecting, the Forgiving. And deliver those who follow thee, lest there befall them what God hath ordained for them in their veiling after thy death, for this is of God's grace upon thee and upon all the worlds. We have visited thy land and found none therein who knew God their Lord or prostrated before Him, though all were worshippers of God their Lord.The Second, in the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most ExaltedGlory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the glory and the gloriousness, Thine is the majesty and the majesticness, Thine is the beauty and the beauteousness, Thine is the grandeur and the grandiosity, Thine is the light and the luminosity, Thine is the mercy and the mercifulness, Thine is the perfection and the perfectness, Thine is the completeness and the completeness, Thine is the might and the mightiness, Thine is the knowledge and the knowingness, Thine is the power and the powerfulness, Thine is the good-pleasure and the pleasantness, Thine is the love and the loveliness, Thine is the nobility and the nobleness, Thine is the sovereignty and the sovereignness, Thine is the dominion and the dominion, Thine is the loftiness \[...\]

Thine is the most exalted sovereignty and the loftiest dominion, and Thine are whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the manifestations of those impregnable Names in the number of all things, wherewith Thou hast permitted all Thy creation, and the like of those exalted similitudes through which Thou hast revealed Thyself unto all Thy servants. Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, established above all things, the Fashioner of all things, and the Essence after all things. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Self-Subsisting, Unique, Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Eternal, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Impregnable, Exalted, All-Powerful. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou dost ever give life and cause to die, then cause to die and give life. Do Thou, O my God, send down these Names in their most glorious form upon Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest - prostrate, worshipful, devoted, mindful, thankful, praising, and mighty - for verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Unique from Whose grasp escapeth not a thing, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art the Third in the Third, powerful over all things.In the Name of God, the Most Intact, the Most IntactPraise be to God Who hath exalted Himself above all contingent beings, and raised Himself by His exaltation above all created things, and made Himself impregnable by His impregnability above all existing things, and empowered Himself by His might above all atoms, and made Himself supreme by His supremacy above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. He hath made Himself and all His creation to bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Pervading. He hath chosen a noble Essence, a radiant Abstraction, an exalted Purity, a majestic Camphor-like Reality, and a beautiful Pattern. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, and through it made Himself impregnable unto it, and cast into its reality the likeness of itself. Then there appeared from it what was within it and upon it, and thereby was the existence filled, both the unseen and the seen, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen for Him primary Names, then caused them to enter the boundless, eternal sea, whereby existence was filled, both the unseen and the seen, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Fourth in the Fourth, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Intact, the Most IntactPraise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Intact, the Most Intact. Verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen except the First One. Furthermore, I testify that there is no path except unto God, exalted be His glory, and no means of attainment save unto Him, mighty be His might. Verily the likeness of every Revelation in relation to another Revelation is as the preparations for the descent of the Sovereign upon His glorious throne. God prepareth the dwellers of every Revelation for the King of the might of Divine Unity, Divine Unity, and the Sovereign of the holiness of Divine Oneness, that they might prepare themselves through these preparations for the revelation of God, the One, the All-Manifesting. And if thou guidest anyone on the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily thy essence deriveth from that Name. Think not that the guidance which is attributed to thee is like the guidance which is attributed to Him Whom God shall make manifest, for every attribute is attached according to the measure of its object. Consider thou \[...\]

Do not imagine that the sovereignty manifesting in thee is like unto the sovereignty manifesting in Him Whom God shall make manifest, for every attribute is in accordance with its subject. Behold thou art one command and sovereignty is another command. Therefore observe the difference between thy command and His command, and likewise in all attributes. All are described by all attributes, but they are as mirrors, whereas in Him Whom God shall make manifest all these attributes are essential, exalted, transcendent, sovereign, powerful and possessive. God reveals Himself through them, testifying that there is no God but Him. His are all the most beautiful names. All who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify Him.There is no God but Him. The twenty-first Gate of the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. The twenty-seventh of the twenty-seventh month of the year. Concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Terrifying". It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. God - there is no God but Him, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden. Say: God is the Most Hidden, above all that possess hiddenness. None in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape from the dominion of His hidden sovereignty. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Hidden, the Concealing, the Veiled.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him in adoration. Praise be to God, Whom all in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify. Say: All stand humbly before Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Verily God shall cause you to be seized, through the angels of the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them, if ye believe in and are assured of Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His manifestation, and after what hath been ordained in your religion, ye doubt not. Say: All that is in the Bayan returneth to two verses, if ye but act upon them. If ye are voyaging upon the ocean of names and attributes, then believe in God and in His names, and be of those who are certain of God's signs.Ye believe not in God, nor in His signs, nor in His names, though ye call upon Him, unless ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, then in those who believe in Him, acting with goodness, and are assured of the words that appear from His presence. Thus were ye created in the Bayan and thus shall ye return. All that ye behold in the Bayan are but modes of the Bayan, if ye would but understand. All the good of the Bayan returneth unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and those who believe in Him. And other than good of the Bayan returneth unto him who believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest.

This is a Book from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of the First. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Announce unto Ja'far, for We are the Announcers.O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and brought thee to life from a beginning that hath no beginning, until the time We made Ourselves known to thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize.We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those on that earth, but We found thee not among the believers. From the beginning of thy life until now thou didst claim to worship God, thy Lord, and deemed thyself among the sincere ones. Thou didst acquire knowledge and considered thyself among the learned, but We came between thee and the people of truth because of what thou didst earn and because thou didst follow thy desires, though thou didst consider thyself among the God-fearing.We created thee for Our meeting on the Day of Resurrection and revealed Our word on that earth, but We forbade that for which thou wast created, even after God had gathered all means for thee. Thus do We prevent the denizens of the Fire from entering Paradise with the believers.From a beginning that hath no beginning until now, thou wert among those who denied God and His signs. And thy belief in God and His signs in the Qur'an - We tested thee in this and found thee not among the believers. When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God and didst not prostrate thyself before thy Lord, thou didst enter the Fire with those who entered therein.Had thou said "yea," it would have been better for thee than all thy worship of God throughout thy life and thy display of knowledge and piety among the believers, for this would have saved thee on the Day of Resurrection. But thou didst earn that which will not save thee, and thou shalt perish like those who perish.We have forbidden those who were given the Qur'an to judge God, their Lord. Yet thou didst cling to the Qur'an and judge Him Who revealed it, deeming thyself among the just ones. Nay, nay! We have found none in Our knowledge among the unbelievers like unto thee.Thou didst exalt thyself through Our names and didst consume the wealth of those who were given the Qur'an by falsely claiming to be one of the learned ones. Even now thou dost call upon God in thy house and weep for the appearance of thy Lord's proof, saying: "Glory be unto Thee, O God! There is no God but Thee. Make manifest Thy proof that he may judge between men, for Thou art the Most Learned of the learned ones."We say unto thee: O thou! Thou hast worshipped none but thyself. If thou worship God, thy Lord, thy worship would return unto Us. We have manifested that for whose appearance thou didst supplicate, yet thou hast sought guidance through His Name and hast judged Him, claiming He hath fabricated lies against God by producing clear signs from God, the Lord of all worlds.Consider whether it is thou who hast fabricated lies against God, or He Who revealed the Qur'an aforetime and now revealeth its like in two days and two nights when He willeth, for He is indeed the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Exalted.By My glory! I shall surely punish thee with the punishment of all the worlds. For had thou followed the Truth on the first day, none upon that earth would have perished.

And verily He is the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the August. By My glory, I shall assuredly chastise thee with the chastisement of all the worlds. For hadst thou followed the Truth on the first day, none would have perished in that land, and all the veils that have screened the veiled ones - their chastisement returneth unto thee. Thou shalt assuredly be raised up in the Bayan, and shalt recite those verses, and shalt testify against thine own self. And if thou diest not on the Day of Resurrection, He Whom God shall make manifest will make thee know thyself as one who believed not in the Bayan, even as thou didst not believe in the Quran though thou professest faith therein. How then canst thou be numbered among them that believe in His verses? Thou deemest thyself, and those who follow thee account thee, as one among the worlds, yet in the sight of God thy Lord - Who is nigh unto His Proof - and in the sight of the angels who are endowed with knowledge from His Proof, thou art more remote than he who confronted Moses, for when he beheld a sign he was not content save to produce sorcery. Yet thou hast not attained to the measure of his understanding, though thou deemest thyself to be among the learned ones. Such is the measure of thy knowledge, which equalleth not even the knowledge of the ancients. Nay, with Us thy station is more remote than those who proclaimed Islam through Muhammad the Apostle of God, for when they heard clear verses they declared: "Verily in these do we believe," after their hearts were assured. But thou hast not shown forth even as they did. Rather, thou hast pronounced judgment upon God Who sent down the Furqan aforetime and the Bayan thereafter, and all Books from a beginning that hath no beginning, and Who will continue to send down all Books from His presence. Verily there is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thou hast labored all thy life to attain somewhat of God's good-pleasure, yet on the Last Day God hath exposed thy inner reality, showing thee to be more remote than the ancients. And We grieve not for thee nor for those like thee, for your likeness is as firewood that consumeth itself when touched by God's fire, until it is reduced to what it was created from - ashes or clay. And verily ye are like unto what ye were created from - clay - and unto it shall ye return. And between these two states of clay ye have earned what causeth God and all things, even your own selves, to curse you, though ye perceive it not and remember it not. Had thy proof in religion not been veiled from thee, how couldst thou have wasted all that thou hast wrought? And hadst thou not been veiled and hadst believed, thou wouldst surely have possessed, like the ancients, the glory of all worlds. Him Who creates the tokens of the Living One by His Word - Him thou followest not, but clingest to the traces of the Living One of the Furqan, though the Furqan was sent down aforetime by His command. Thus doth God test all His servants until He separateth all the veiled ones. Verily We opened on the first day the gates of Paradise to all the worlds, saying: "O all things! Enter ye into Paradise, for this is what ye have been striving for throughout your lives." All desire to enter therein, yet they cannot by reason of what their hands have wrought. If thou hadst known God in the inmost essence before His Manifestation, thou wouldst surely have known God thy Lord in the most outward appearance after His Manifestation. We made thee a negation at the end of night and a negation at the end of day, after We had taught thee the ways of guidance whereof thou wast not aware.

And at the close of day, after We had shown thee the paths of guidance, thou wert not mindful thereof and didst imagine thyself to be among the sincere ones. O thou who dost advance a claim! Let him who would advance a claim bring forth proof before those who desire not to believe in him. If they can produce the like of his proof, then shall his words be nullified and they shall prevail. Otherwise, his words shall not be nullified, nor shall the proof he possesseth be refuted. Therefore do We counsel you, O people of the Bayan, that ye confront no one except with the like of what he possesseth, if ye desire to prevail. Otherwise, the truth shall be established and all else shall perish. How many souls confronted Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and brought about their own destruction because they were powerless to produce the like of what God had revealed unto Him! Had they been ashamed, they would not have confronted Him, and had they understood the proof He possessed, they would not have opposed Him. But they imagined they were defending their faith. God seized them for what they had wrought and established the truth through truth, even as ye all now witness Muhammad's Cause. Who can confront the Manifestations of Truth in every Dispensation, when all are upheld by them? And all who have confronted them from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, God hath caused to perish and hath established the truth through truth. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent. O thou! After having earned all this fire, if thou shouldst return unto God, He will surely transform thy fire into light from His presence. Verily He is the Munificent, the Generous. And if thou shouldst remember before We raise the Cause unto God, thou wilt remember that which will tranquilize thy heart and the hearts of those who have followed thee without truth or an enlightening Book. Otherwise it shall not cease. I have perfected what I have detailed of the verses. There is no altering them, and all shall be assured of them until the Day of Resurrection. But We have shown grace and mercy to make known unto thee the paths whereby thou mayest be saved. Verily We are the Bountiful Ones. Therefore write thou unto Him Whom God shall make manifest a letter, and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and counsel that God's sincere servants shall deliver it unto Him. If it reacheth the hand of God, perchance God will forgive what thou hast wrought and pardon thee on the Day of Resurrection in the Book. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the All-Forgiving. Verily We were, before and after, knowing all things. Verily We were, before and after, powerful over all things. Verily We were, before and after, exalted above all things. Verily We were, before and after, inaccessible above all things. All prostrate themselves before Us in the world of the unseen and the visible, but We accept not those who prostrate themselves before Us in the unseen unless We witness their prostration before Us in the visible realm. Otherwise We shall destroy them and their works. Verily We are the Triumphant Ones. Not an atom's weight escapeth Our knowledge in the heavens or in the earth or in what lieth between them. Verily We are knowing of all things. Nothing in the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them can frustrate Us. Verily We have power over all things. Think not that thou hast any worth before Us\[...\]

Think not that thou possessest any worth before Us, though We have mentioned thee. Say: Glory be to God above that which we have uttered! Verily, one who possesseth no knowledge and was among those who built the House - whom no one among all peoples recognized - was of the companions who followed the Truth with knowledge in the night. Ye are God's image "33" upon the Most Exalted Land. They who follow their own imaginings and suppose themselves pious in their religion do not testify to guidance. When one like thee and those similar to thee are mentioned, your worth equateth not the worth of donkeys. And if your worth before one who followed the Truth from the presence of those who were truly prostrate before Us was of such degree, how then could ye possess worth before God, even if what was said was true? And We, had We not testified to this with truth, would not have mentioned aught but the word of truth. Otherwise, how many servants are praised without right, and how many are not praised - both being equal before God and before those endowed with knowledge. But We desired to make known to thee thy station before one who had no standing yet was among the truthful before God, that thou mightest feel shame in thy religion and not transgress thy bounds. Verily those who followed Me, all of them together, saw neither thee nor thy like as worth even a handful of clay, and they truly see thee not thus, and We were indeed the Revealer. But thou, after having witnessed those who attained such detachment and elevation, who received Our messages and believed in Our words, felt no shame before thyself to know thy proper bounds, and wert not among those who feel shame. Those who supported thee in thy judgment are aspects of the fire within thyself. God hath gathered you within the veils of fire, and there existeth no fire more intense than your own selves against yourselves before your Lord, for ye suppose that ye worship God. God beareth witness that ye are in the fire being tormented because ye know not God, your Lord, after God made Himself known to you - if ye but knew what ye earn! Ye would wish for death and would not pass judgment upon God, your Lord, though night and day ye prostrate before Him. But We have lifted from you your awareness that We might torment you through your veils and make you know your true selves - that ye were not worshippers of God. If ye worshipped God, ye would follow the proof of your Lord. And had ye grasped the word "Yea," it would have been better for you than all that ye have wrought in your life and the knowledge ye have acquired, supposing yourself among the saved. Thy likeness is as those who believed in Jesus, son of Mary, then when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them, believed not in Him, supposing in their religion that they were believers in God their Lord. Had they truly believed in God their Lord, they would have believed in Muhammad before, when God revealed the Furqan. But they entered their religion whence they saw not, until they were taken and returned to clay, and they were not helped before God. O people of the Bayan! Have mercy upon yourselves, for verily We have cut down such a tree\[...\]

O people of the Bayan! Have mercy upon your own souls, for verily We have cut down such a tree that bore no fruit throughout its entire life by saying "Yea" unto God, even though it and its followers, night and day, engaged in prayers and were vigilant in their Faith, and deemed themselves among the God-fearing. Therefore, hold ye fast unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He may set aright all that pertaineth unto you, and ye shall attain unto all good. This is what We have enjoined upon you and upon all mankind, and verily We are independent of all things. Whoso believeth in God and His signs, it shall be to his own benefit, and whoso remaineth veiled therefrom, it shall be to his own loss. Our proof hath been completed unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth and all that lieth between them, and unto all the worlds. Verily, that which ye have invented in God's religion - when ye delayed your prayers beyond their appointed times while ye bear witness against yourselves of their performance - woe unto you! Did God permit this? This is a judgment ye have made of your own accord. Verily, the making up of prayers is an act different from that which ye are commanded to perform at the appointed hour. Should the hour of death come upon any one of you when the sun hath passed its zenith and ye have not yet offered your prayers, and should death overtake you, then upon you shall rest the obligation of making up what ye have missed aforetime, as well as that which ye have delayed by your own hands. God, your Lord, will assuredly chastise you for both; however, if ye do perform your prayers, God will not chastise you except for your delayed prayers. This is the benefit of your piety; how is it that ye understand not?The twenty-second chapter concerning the command and ye remember not, from the twenty-seventh unity of the twenty-seventh month of the year. In the Name of God, the Most Dawning, the Most Dawning. The knowledge of the Name of the Dawning One hath four stations. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Dawning, the Most Dawning.God! There is no God but He, the Most Dawning, the Most Dawning.Say: God is the Most Dawning, above every possessor of dawn. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His dawning authority, whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. Verily, He hath been the Dawning One, the Most Dawning, the All-Dawning.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, before Whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth and whatsoever is between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Essence, then the Strength and the Chrysolite, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing whether in the heavens or on the earth or whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall cause rivers to flow forth for you, that ye may \[...\]

Say: God will cause rivers to flow forth for you, that ye may believe in God and His signs and be of those who render thanks. Say: He is the Conqueror over His creation, and He is the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: He is the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. He it is Who causeth you to be changed by night and by day. There is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Well-Beloved.If during your nights ye desire to establish something, then establish books concerning the names that were revealed in the Bayan, and make clear what can be derived from them, and set forth their numbers, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may make mention thereof before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Then praise ye the Truth. But if ye were to produce a book concerning the Bayan, it would suffice you all together.And multiply not the matters of your knowledge lest ye be veiled from the Essence of knowledge on the Day of Resurrection while ye perceive not. And write ye a book concerning rhymes and present it unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may make mention before God. And arrange this and organize it in the most perfect manner ye are able. And write not in the book other than words in rhyme lest ye make difficult for yourselves the affairs of your souls, and on the Day of Resurrection ye be veiled thereby from that which shall appear from Him Whom God shall make manifest.That which ye possess - ye shall surely encompass the knowledge of the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest if ye be sincere in the matters of your knowledge. And that which ye have is not befitting for Him. God sendeth down what He willeth by His command and confirmeth what He desireth through His Proof. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Mighty.This is a Book from God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Inform the son of Muhammad in the Book, for We are the Informers.O thou! Verily We created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and gave thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We made known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be of those who recognize. And We sent Messenger after Messenger and revealed the Book unto those on that earth, yet We heard not that thou wert of those who recognized.Verily We created thee for the day of meeting with Us and made known unto thee Our Self, that there is no God but I, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. And thou didst place thyself between thyself and thy Lord when thou wert created for meeting with Us. Thus doth God prevent His veiled servants from entering Paradise. And verily We are ashamed to mention that which thy soul hath merited. We have completed Our proof against thee even as We completed it against all the worlds.And when thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God and didst not say "yea," thou didst change thy light for fire after thou hadst entered thyself into the fire of the inmost of the inmost and wert not of those who are steadfast. And Our proof was completed against all who are on the earth at the end of the night and beginning of the day. Those who followed the Truth - these are the believers. And those who veiled themselves - these are the companions of the fire and therein shall they not be helped.When thou didst hear a verse, Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed in the Furqan, if thou art of those who reflect. We revealed aforetime in the Furqan that none but God can reveal a verse, that perchance those who were given the Furqan might remember when they hear the verses of God on the day of His manifestation. Then may they attain certitude. Thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life \[...\]

And these are they who shall not be helped therein. When thou didst hear a verse, Our evidence was completed against thee, even as it was completed in the Qur'an, if thou be of them that reflect. We have revealed aforetime in the Qur'an that none besides God is able to bring down a verse, that perchance they who were given the Qur'an might remember when they hear the verses of God on the day of His manifestation. Then might they attain unto certitude through Him. Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life, yet nothing profiteth thee with God, and We are cognizant of all things. Thou hast pronounced judgment upon Him before Whom thou didst prostrate thyself throughout thy life, and thou didst reckon thyself among them that judge for God. Behold how We have tried those who were given the Qur'an and have drawn thee and them away from their light unto the fire, inasmuch as they believe not in Our signs. We have forbidden thee Our recognition, and that is a fire than which no fire can be more intense. Thus doth God take vengeance on those who are before Him as letters of negation, while they reckon themselves, and are reckoned by men, to be letters of affirmation and are numbered among the believers. Thou hast taken pride in Our names without right after thou didst not deserve anything, and We were ever just. All that thou hast learned, even as they who are possessed of crafts learn in their trades, profiteth thee not at all with God, and We are they who question concerning all things. And verily Our evidence against thy father in the end of night in the manifest exterior was he who is remembered by the name Muhammad-'Ali, that he might follow the truth through knowledge and forbid those who follow their vain imaginings in their religion and reckon themselves to be striving. And verily in the inmost interior Our evidence against him was he who was in the Holy Land and they who were given the knowledge of truth learned from him, while all others were veiled from the path of truth. And verily from the first moment the Bayan was revealed on the Day of Resurrection, all are presented before God thy Lord. And they whom none of the worlds knew, when they believed in God and His signs, We made them in the Book to be among the inheritors. And We caused them to attain unto that which is possible in the Book and beyond that, as a bounty from Us, for verily We are the Bountiful. And hadst thou believed in the station of one of them on the first day, God thy Lord would surely have made thee to be among the foremost. But the matter hath been decreed, and thou possessest naught save audacity on the Day of Resurrection, and were God thy Lord to give thee all that is on earth and thou shouldst offer it in ransom, thou wouldst not escape from the punishment of that day - all shall be requited according to what they have earned. Thou didst reckon between thyself and God that thou wert among the sincere ones. Yet with God thy Lord thou art more remote than the former ones, for when they confronted Moses they brought forth something of sorcery, while thou broughtest forth nothing, then didst transgress the bounds of God and reckon thyself among the God-fearing. And because of what thou didst purpose against the Primal Point, We have decreed for thee what is merited in the justice of God by him who slew 'Ali aforetime in the Qur'an. Thus doth God raise up whom He willeth above whom He willeth through them on the Day of Resurrection.

And because of that which was purposed at the Primal Point, We have decreed against thee what justice deserveth in the sight of God for the slaying of Ali aforetime in the Furqan. Thus doth God cause to be raised up whom He willeth from whom He willeth on the Day of Resurrection, and verily We have power over all things. Behold whom thou worshippest by night and by day. When He made Himself known unto thee, thou didst purpose against His Proof that which pleaseth not any among the unbelievers. And how could any of the believers be pleased therewith? Verily God shall chastise thee with the chastisement of all who have desired such a deed from time immemorial until now, nay until the Day of Resurrection, and God is the severest of avengers. Nay, that which thou didst purpose is greater than what can be attributed to anything, for this is attributed to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Thinkest thou that thou hast comprehended a single letter of the Furqan or the words of the True Imams? Say: Glory be to God! We were not witnesses over thee. How many servants have comprehended what was revealed in the Gospel, yet when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came unto them, they believed not in Him. Had they truly comprehended a single letter of the Gospel or the words of those who were witnesses over creation after Jesus, they would have believed in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and would have been guided by the signs of God.For the meaning of what God revealed unto Muhammad, and the meaning of what was revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, is what was revealed in the Bayan unto the Primal Point, and the meaning of what was revealed in the Bayan is what God shall reveal unto Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. O people of the Bayan! Watch over your souls, then fear God.Verily thy father and thee, in the latter part of the night, were naught but among the deniers. How then shall We mention what thou didst acquire before what was acquired? Verily We are ashamed to mention it, though he was not ashamed to commit it, and God shall judge with truth between all peoples.Had he said during his lifetime, concerning one whom people know to possess knowledge of the inmost mysteries, that he was true, it would have been better in the sight of God than all his striving in religion and his desire to be among the sincere ones. We have decreed concerning those who were unjustly slain by his command that they should receive what God had previously ordained regarding what was preserved of God's decree, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.After what We had revealed aforetime that none should be punished save those who deserve it by their own deeds, how then did he follow that which God had not permitted in the Book? Thus shall God question those who think they do good. And verily the thought that crossed his mind regarding one who disputed with him in his land, from one who teacheth people knowledge of truth without truth - his sin is greater than if he had worshipped God his Lord throughout his entire life while desiring to be among the sincere ones in God's religion.Say: Who gave thee permission to take what God had ordained for His Proof and to spend it on the House or on those who know not God their Lord, or in the path of thine own self?

And you would take possession of the house, or deal with those who know not God their Lord, or use it for your own purposes, thinking yourself to be among the sincere ones. Nay! The house wherein is made mention of the name of thy Lord, morning and evening, you would rule over it without right, and build a house of clay for God, imagining yourself to be among the sincere ones. Were what you have built to return to what you would recognize in the latter part of the night, after having been among the believers... Say: That which belongs to God returns to the Manifestation of His Self, and if you were to recognize Him Who expounds the truth from His presence, you would surely designate the house by His name, after having been among those who upheld the truth. Observe how those who were given knowledge do not take their Imam's right, and if they do take it, they do not dispose of it as they should, even though they are certain of God and His signs. How is it you followed not the truth from these people, if you were among the cautious in your religion? Say: This indeed opposeth my desire, otherwise I would have followed the truth from God, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! Were We to appear on earth, We would surely call you to account and take from you all that you have taken, even to the smallest particle and less than that. And those who have taken what God had written for Me - I shall not grant you even as much as the film of a date-stone, for you do not deserve that I should give you anything, since you know not God your Lord inasmuch as you know Me not, that you should deserve to possess anything. Yet you imagine yourselves to be God-fearing. And verily the command of God concerning what you have built for God is that it should be razed from above the water until no trace of it remaineth, by Our compelling power, for We are the Compellers. You would destroy without right and without a clear Book the house wherein the mention of thy Lord's name is celebrated, and would build without right and without permission from Him Whose right you have taken, a house of clay wherein those should pray who are not worthy to enter the house of God even for a moment. We have indeed revealed in the Qur'an the limits of all things, that you might not transgress them. But when We manifested Ourselves, We found you turning away from God's path while thinking that you were supporting God's religion. O thou! What thou hast learned is like unto a thousand loads of figs, and what We have taught from thy father's pilgrim is like unto nineteen mithqals of gold whose splendor equals the splendor of those figs, and what We possess is like unto a piece of ruby whose splendor equals the splendor of that gold. God will show you your stations on the Day of Resurrection that you might \[ascend\]. For all that you have learned returns to the good pleasure of God, and the good pleasure of God is manifested only through the good pleasure of His Proof. And We were not pleased with you nor with those who believed not in Our signs at the time of Our manifestation. And We surely dissociate Ourselves from those who have spread calumnies against Us while they pride themselves before the people in Our names. They imagine they are judges by Our authority. Nay! He who is made a judge by His Proof would not judge against him whom God has made a judge \[...\]

They imagine they are among Our judges, but nay! Whosoever would judge by His proof does not judge over one whom God has made a judge. You and those who follow you are in the Fire unless you return to the religion of God. And God will surely return to you the fire of those who follow you, and will question you after your death about what you did in God's religion. And if you desire to enter into God's religion, you will never comprehend what We have willed except that you learn from those who understand what We have ordained in the Book. And if you learn the knowledge of truth from one whom We have taught, then it will benefit you in that you will be able to understand what has been revealed in the Book from God, the Protector, the Exalted.The matter has been decreed, and if you return to God your Lord and are among those who seek forgiveness, perhaps God will transform negation into affirmation in the Book. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Generous, the Bountiful.The matter being concluded, what has been decreed from God has been established, and you will find no way around it. And if you remember after this and wish to be among the saved ones, then write a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest. And seek forgiveness from God your Lord therein, and arrange for one of God's sincere servants to deliver it to Him. Perhaps God will transform the fire into light from His presence if you seek forgiveness from God your Lord therein and are among the penitent ones. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Merciful, the Compassionate.He desires to guide everyone, to forgive their sins, and to admit them into Paradise with the believers. The Twenty-third Gate of the Twenty-seventh Unity of the Twenty-seventh Month of the Year, concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Binding One" which has four stages. The first stage: In the Name of God, the Most Binding, the Most Binding. God - there is no God but He, the Most Binding, the Most Binding.Say: God binds above all who bind. None in the heavens or the earth or what lies between them can resist the sovereignty of His binding command. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily He has ever been the Binder, the Binding, the Most Binding. Glorified be He before Whom prostrates whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are prostrating unto Him.And praise be to God, Whom glorifies whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. Say: All are devoted to Him. God bears witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm.He gives life and causes death, then causes death and gives life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dies not, and the King Who perishes not, and the Just Who wrongs not, and the Sovereign Who changes not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapes, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lies between them. He creates what He wills by His command. Verily He has power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lies between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens \[...\]

Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will assuredly bind you to the proof of Him Whom God shall make manifest, even though ye may not bind yourselves to a proof like unto that which We have bound you in the Bayan, and ye are powerless to accept that whereunto We have bound you unless ye enter into the Bayan and attain certitude therein.Indeed We had established aforetime in the Furqan that none other than God can reveal a single verse, and during the years of the seedling ye have witnessed this with your own eyes and were among those who were certain of it. Through that which is established in the religion of Islam in the Furqan, ye are bound to establish the truth in the Bayan and attain certitude in what hath been revealed therein.Verily We had revealed aforetime in the Furqan that should all who dwell on earth assemble together, they would be powerless to produce the like of that which We have revealed. And thereafter We have revealed the like thereof in the Bayan and bound you, according to that wherein ye formerly believed, to believe in what We have revealed in the Bayan even as ye believed in the Quran.Thus doth God bind you through that which He hath previously given you, but ye do not understand. Ye reflect not, and in your knowledge ye are powerless to manifest the Cause of God as it behooveth the Cause of God. Only they who seek God's good-pleasure do through their knowledge attain certitude in that moment and act according to what God hath revealed, whether the means of power be made manifest unto them or not. They believe in what God hath taught. But besides them, if their knowledge be not joined with power, the Cause of God will not be made manifest. Consider ye this well that ye may aid the religion of God.They who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest through knowledge and wisdom - these are they who are sincere. And they who wait until God manifests unto them the means of power - these are they whose faith is weak. Therefore weaken not in your faith in God, your Lord, but be ye among the God-fearing.Should ye behold Him Whom God shall make manifest and none be with Him save yourselves, even as ye behold all who are on earth prostrate before Him, ye should follow Him and not weaken. This is the path of God for those who are endowed with knowledge and wisdom and who have certitude in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in His witnesses.Say: God verily loveth to gather all who are on earth unto what hath been revealed in the Bayan, the religion of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, that all may enter into the good-pleasure of God, the Mighty, the Beloved, and all may attain on the Day of Resurrection the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and all may appear before their Lord and prostrate themselves.This is the bounty of God which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily there is no God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.This is a Book from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of 'He' - there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto the Mahdi in the Book, for verily We are the Announcers. O thou! Verily We have created thee and provided for thee \[...\]

We provided for you, bestowed upon you, and gave you life from the beginning that hath no beginning until the time We made Ourself known to you through Our signs, that ye might be of them that recognize. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto thy father that he might save himself on the Day of Resurrection and be numbered among the believers. Yet We heard not from him the word "yea" when he heard of the Manifestation of God, and thus was lost all for which he had labored in his lifetime. Verily, We are cognizant of all things. And thou, when thou didst hear, departed from that wherein thou wert, in that thou didst not say "yea, I am one of the believers." And when thou didst hear a verse or witness a sign, Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed aforetime in the Qur'an, and We were witness over all things. Thou didst acquire knowledge that thou mightest save thyself and those who followed thee on the Day of Resurrection from the fire, yet it profited thee not even to the extent of a date-stone. And hadst thou not acquired knowledge but remained veiled, thou wouldst have entered the fire thyself, but now the fire of those who were veiled from the path of God returneth unto thee, for hadst thou followed the Truth, they would have followed. Thou didst worship God, thy Lord, throughout thy life and wert among those who prostrated themselves before Us. Yet from all thy worship there came not forth the word "yea," nor from all thy prostrations submission before Our presence. Thus doth God render vain the deeds of them who act in the realm of the unseen, then on the Day of Manifestation act not as they had acted for God aforetime. Thou didst appear before God yet knew not God, thy Lord, and wert not among the ashamed. After We had forbidden thee in the Qur'an to put thyself forward before God and His Messenger, thou didst put thyself forward before Us without right and wert among the veiled ones. Though thou art in the eyes of them who dwell in thy land a foolish man, yet God will make manifest the truth in the Book that thou mayest be ashamed in the Bayan and be of them that are ashamed. Verily We witnessed thy foolishness from Him Who revealed the Qur'an aforetime, then revealed the Bayan thereafter - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. Thou asketh about the mention of ablutions that was revealed aforetime in the Book. Wert thou not foolish, wouldst thou ask of Him Who hath, in the beginning of His Book, through clear verses at which the learned are confounded, invalidated all who believe not in Him? And of thy foolishness, after this thou didst command that thy father's book be brought before God, that thou mightest adduce proof therefrom and be of them that pride themselves. Though thy father had ascended to a horizon above which no servant of Ours could ascend, and though he attributed himself to Us and was among the learned, wouldst thou adduce the words of creation as proof against the words of God in His presence? Hast thou seen one as foolish as thyself or heard of such among all peoples? And thy conduct toward Our servant Muhammad-i-Taqi is such that We are ashamed to mention it. How is it thou art not ashamed of what thou hast wrought, and deemest thyself to be among the diligent? Though his bounty is not hidden from any in all the worlds, and his knowledge surpasseth the knowledge of those who pride themselves in his like, how is it thou art not ashamed on the Day of Resurrection?

Know that His knowledge surpasseth the knowledge of them who pride themselves in its like. How is it that thou art not ashamed on the Day of Resurrection, accounting thyself among the God-fearing? Behold how We have nullified thee and thy like upon the earth, by virtue of that which hath proceeded from your hands which ye worship by night and by day - that whereof God is ashamed to make mention. Thus doth God nullify your souls and your deeds, and ye shall write with your own hands the records of your deeds, and every soul who entereth the Bayan shall curse you for what ye have wrought until the Day of Resurrection. Ye return unto the names of those before you, yet ye know not your own selves. Were ye to know them, ye would wish for death. The station of the martyrs of God's Faith is too exalted for the likes of thee. What hast thou to do with that most exalted horizon whereunto God permitteth none save those who know God their Lord and are assured of His signs? These are they who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and these are they who shall triumph. If thou desirest to account thyself from before the Furqan, thou wert not among those who could prove their claims. How then couldst thou be numbered among the believers in the Bayan? Muhammad-'Ali before Our manifestation was among the righteous in the outward observance of your Faith, but those who followed their vain imaginings and invented principles in their religion from their own selves have strayed from their Lord's path, and their knowledge shall veil them on the Day of Resurrection from their faith in God their Lord, though they know it not. If thou wouldst remember and desire to be among the guided ones, then return unto God thy Lord with those who have followed thee, for We are forgiving. When the matter is accomplished, that which I have detailed of clear verses hath been made firm, and all shall be assured thereof until the Day of Resurrection. If thou rememberest thereafter, then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and be thou among the penitent. And enjoin that should any of the believers reach Him, he may beseech God - if He willeth He may forgive thee, and if He willeth He may not forgive - all return unto God their Lord. But God shall surely forgive those who seek forgiveness of God their Lord in their writings and are sincere. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the Merciful.This is a Book from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce thou unto Hasan in the Book, for verily We are the Announcers. O Hasan! We created thee and provided for thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We would make Ourself known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto him who was upon that earth that thou mightest be among the guided ones. Yet he hath veiled himself from the manifestation of God without right or illuminating Book, though throughout thy life thou hast worshipped God thy Lord and hast been among those who bow down before Us. Verily I am your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi, He Who was promised unto you. We have nurtured you in the Bayan for one thousand two hundred and seventy years that ye might be enlightened by the proof of your religion. We revealed in the Furqan that none but God could reveal a single verse, that perchance they who were given the Furqan might remember when they hear, and thereby be guided.

We revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can reveal verses, that perchance those who were given the Qur'an might remember when they hear and be guided thereby. Yet We have not witnessed the tree of thy faith bearing the fruit of "Yea" within thyself, though throughout thy life thou hast been among those who serve Us. Had thou said "Yea," it would have been better for thee on the Day of Resurrection than all thy deeds and strivings to be counted among the God-fearing. But at that time what thou hast earned will profit thee not, except that through what thou hast learned thou hast cast thyself and thy followers into the fire. Thou hast not benefited thyself, how much less any of thy followers. And verily the principles ye have invented in God's religion without His leave - how do ye not understand? Ye toil at a knowledge that will not profit you a grain of mustard seed, and on the Day of Resurrection ye shall be veiled thereby. The fruit of knowledge is that one might be saved thereby on the Day of Resurrection and encompass the knowledge of his Lord's good-pleasure and be among those who act upon it. God hath revealed the source of His good-pleasure, yet ye remain veiled by your desires. Ye toil at your principles hoping to encompass the knowledge of God's good-pleasure in your religion, yet ye find no way thereto. Those who follow their conjectures and opinions are all far removed from God's path. And whoso in the religion of God held fast to Muhammad before 'Ali was aforetime upon a path of certain truth. This is according to the outer meaning of what was revealed in the Book, and as to the inner meaning of what was revealed - none knoweth the knowledge of the inmost of the inner save those who are thankful unto Us. But ye have reckoned what ye possess to be water, and when God manifesteth His proof, your knowledge will be shown to be but a mirage. Ye suppose yourselves to be in God's good-pleasure, but ye persist in that which is other than His good-pleasure. Throughout thy life thou didst prostrate thyself before Me, yet when I made Myself known to thee, thou didst judge Me wrongfully. Thus will God, thy Lord, chastise thee by thine own hands for what thou didst write wrongfully - verily He is severe in punishment. And the chastisement of those who follow thee shall return upon thee - God is just and wise. We created thee only for the day of meeting with Us, even as We revealed in the third verse of the Surih of Thunder, but it is as though thou hast not perceived what We revealed and art not among those who remember. We have forbidden thee Our presence after We created thee for it, though We had made a covenant in the Book with every soul that it should appear before Us on the Day of Resurrection and be among those who worship Us. And even as Our proof was perfected against thee in the Qur'an, so hath Our proof been perfected against thee in the Bayan. There is no altering God's command. Say: All is from God and verily we all believe in all. If thou wilt remember and return unto God, thou shalt find God, thy Lord, forgiving, merciful. But if thou remainest veiled, thou shalt surely die and return to dust and enter the fire, wherein thou shalt find no protector from God.

No helper or supporter hath he. And if thou rememberest after the matter hath been decreed and desirest to be among those who are saved, then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and enjoin that it be delivered unto Him by one of God's sincere servants. If it reacheth God, perchance God will change thy negation into affirmation, and pardon thee through His Proof. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.This is the Day of Resurrection wherein all are brought before God thy Lord. All shall be rewarded according to what they have earned from their Lord. The twenty-fifth Gate of the twenty-seventh Unity of the twenty-seventh Month of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name "The All-Expanding" which hath four stations. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Expanding, the Most Expanding. God, there is no God but He, the Most Expanding, the Most Expanding. Say: God is the Most Expanding, above every possessor of expansion. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withstand the power of His sovereign expansion. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Expander, the All-Expanding, the One Who Expandeth All.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His is the dominion and the kingdom, then the might and the omnipotence, then the power and the divinity, then the strength and the chrysolite, then the sovereignty and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall expand your breasts through the remembrance of Him Whom God shall make manifest and through His praise. Do ye not desire to be expanded? Those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest - their hearts are more vast than all that is in the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. God hath not placed in their breasts even a mustard seed's weight of veils. He expandeth their hearts, spirits, souls and bodies, and all that pertaineth to them through the exaltation of the remembrance of their Lord's Proof and the inaccessibility of the Word of the Manifestation of their Origin, and they rejoice in the remembrance of the All-Merciful.These are they whose hearts God hath expanded through the lights of knowledge and wisdom. They desire naught save God and they are mindful in His remembrance. They will naught save what God hath willed and they stand firm by His command. Their breasts are mirrors - whatsoever He Whom God shall make manifest willeth becometh imprinted therein. Thus doth God expand the hearts of those who believe in God and His signs and are assured of the Hereafter.Say: Verily the Hereafter is the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Make not any of God's commandments dubious unto yourselves, but behold all things that God hath created by His command with the eyes of your hearts, even as ye behold with your physical eyes.

Behold with the eyes of your hearts all that God hath created by His command, even as ye behold with your physical eyes. Verily those who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest -- their hearts are more confined than an atom, after God had expanded their hearts through the proof of Him Whom God shall make manifest. But since they are not convinced thereof, they remain veiled without right, and think that they do well. Their breasts shall never be impressed by what lieth within the breasts of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that they may be relieved from the burden of that which they possess and may enter, from every direction, into the House of expansiveness -- the beginning of beginnings and the return of returns being the limit of their understanding within themselves. Yet they remain veiled without right and think that they do well, like those who were given the Gospel: when God revealed the Qur'an, had their hearts been expanded they would have believed in Muhammad, the Messenger of God. But they had themselves purified their hearts and held fast to what they possessed and thought they did well, until one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five years had elapsed since God had guided them through Jesus, and even until now they stand firm in their path. Before God sent Muhammad, they were in paradise if they followed the bounds of their religion. And after that, the expansion of their breasts was lifted from them, yet they perceive not. O ye possessors of faith in the Bayan! Expand your breasts through the remembrance of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then through the words that shall appear from Him, if ye desire to ascend in the kingdom of beginnings and the heaven of endings. And if there occur to your souls anything contrary to God's good-pleasure, be not grieved and make not yourselves distressed, for this will not harm you by so much as a mustard seed. This is from the conditions of negation that occur to your souls without your consent, and God will remove it from you when ye remember Him. Whenever ye find this within yourselves, drink five cups of water singly and then lie down. For when moisture is absorbed into your bodies, that which descendeth upon you without your leave and consent will be lifted from your hearts. And occupy yourselves with that which will remove from your hearts what ye love not. This is from the loftiness of your faith in God, your Lord, if ye believe in and are convinced of Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection. God hath not charged any soul except according to its capacity - this is a firm principle in your religion, so hold fast unto it and walk in God's religion with expansiveness. This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Announce this in the Book, for We have ever been the Announcers. O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, that We might make thee know Our Self through Our signs, if thou wouldst be of those who recognize. We made Our Self known through the Messengers and the signs, but We found thee not among those who remember. Thou didst worship God thy Lord in thy life and wert among those who prostrate. But when thou didst recognize God thy Lord, thou didst judge Him in a way that no soul would be content to judge another soul. Thus shall God thy Lord cause thee to enter the Fire with those who enter therein.

When thou hast recognized God as thy Lord, thou hast judged Him by that which no soul would be content to judge another, wherefore will thy Lord cause thee to enter the fire with those who enter therein. Thou hast imagined thyself to be among the diligent ones. Nay, nay! The measure of thy faith is less than that of him who confronted Moses when he brought forth something of sorcery. Yet thou, after being rendered powerless, wast not ashamed to be like unto him, and hast manifested that which God would be ashamed to mention, whilst thou wast not ashamed of thine action and didst deem thyself among the God-fearing.Consider who are nearer in the Book of God - those who accepted Islam through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, by virtue of what God revealed in the Furqan, or those who believed in the Quran for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, yet when they beheld that proof from their Lord, did not manifest what these others manifested, even though in their hearts they were not certain. This is thy station before God, whilst thou and those who follow thee unjustly imagine yourselves to be among the sincere ones.Even as Our proof was completed against thee in the Furqan, so hath Our proof been completed against thee in the Bayan. There is no alteration in God's command. We were its Revealers before and are its Revealers after. Ask the minds of children and inquire of them - concerning the Quran, they will say at once: "This is the Book of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling." Then recite unto them the Bayan and ask them from Whom it is, and they will say at once: "This is from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling."Then judge yourselves by what their hearts recognize - that what revealed the Furqan hath revealed the Bayan, and there is no God but Him. We cannot but believe that there is no God but Him, for when We said the Furqan was from Him, and then saw the Bayan manifestly from Him, how could We depart from what We believed before concerning the Furqan, after We were among the truthful ones? Thus doth God bestow His grace upon those who were given the Furqan, as children testify with their hearts, though you claim knowledge and wisdom, yet comprehend not according to their understanding.If thou art certain that the Furqan is the Book of God, thou hast no choice but to be certain that the Bayan is from Him, and that there is no God but I, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. We had revealed therein before that none but God can reveal a single verse. When those who were given the Furqan hear a verse from God's Book, they remember, then believe.Thou hast followed all the parts of thy religion and remained veiled from Him Who created those parts for His sake, and thou wast not among those who perceive. Verily, these were created for the exaltation of Muhammad's mention before, then for the invincibility of the Primal Point's Word after, but thou comprehendest nothing that thou mightest be among those who see. All religion is, in Our sight, nearer than the twinkling of an eye - We create it, then determine its measures as We please.

But thou shalt understand nothing thereof and shalt not be numbered among those possessed of insight. All religion is unto Us nearer than the twinkling of an eye. We create it, then ordain its measures as We please, yet thou remainest veiled from Him Who created it, though thou deemest thyself to be among the devout. Nay, nay! We have cut thee off and tormented thee for that which thou hast judged concerning God. Those who followed thee - their fire We shall return unto thee in this Book of God. This is what thou hast understood of thy knowledge amidst all peoples, and until the Day of Resurrection all who read that Book shall curse thee. Had thou said "yea," it would have been better for thee than all wherewith thou hast worshipped God, thy Lord, throughout thy life. And God shall send down upon thee, in requital for that Book, an exalted, sublime glory, whereby thou shalt be renowned among all peoples until the Day of Resurrection. But the matter hath been decreed concerning thee. If thou returnest unto God and art numbered among those who seek forgiveness, perchance God will transform thy soul through His confirmations, for verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Pardoning, the Merciful. And if the matter be concluded as hath been revealed, its verses have been made firm, and all shall be assured thereof until the Day of Resurrection. And if thou rememberest thereafter and desirest to be numbered among those who shall be saved, then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and enjoin that one among God's sincere servants shall deliver it unto Him. Perchance God will transform thy fire into light and will pardon thee in the latter Resurrection after the former. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the Bountiful. Even were all upon the earth to believe in Me, and were they to enter the Paradise by their own selves, We verily are independent of all things. And if they veil themselves, they shall enter the Fire by their own selves. Verily, We are powerful over all things. However, We desire naught save that We should cause all to enter into the religion of God, and that We should set aright what pertaineth unto them in the Book of God, and that We should transform their fire into light - a bounty from Our presence and a mercy, for verily We are the Bountiful. Behold how God hath taken thee by thy hands in thy religion. He hath glorified thee through words of good-pleasure - a proof from thy Lord - though thou didst reckon between thyself and God that thou wert among the sincere ones. Thus doth God reveal thine inward reality by thine own hands. Hadst thou understood these words, thou wouldst not have denied the Cause of God nor wouldst thou have been among the perishing ones. The example which thou hast mentioned - though thy veiling be in the first veil - through this are created all who have been and shall be created, and this is, in the sight of God, in the veil of the letter Ya in an impregnable Book. Therefore, O people of the Bayan, watch over your souls on the Day of Resurrection, for verily ye are assured of the One of the Bayan on that Day. But this shall profit you not unless ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and in whatsoever He shall ordain. Even as it profited you aforetime in your religion, watch over your souls lest ye be veiled from the Causes of the Messengers and the Books, while ye cling to their effects. The Second in the Name of God, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest. The Second: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Unto Thee belongeth the Kingdom and the Dominion, and unto Thee belongeth might \[...\]

Thine is the might and the omnipotence, Thine is the power and the divinity, Thine is the strength and the sovereignty, Thine is the dominion and the human realm, Thine is the glory and the majesty, Thine is the countenance and the beauty, Thine is the visage and the perfection, Thine are the similitudes and the parables, Thine are the stations and the grandeur, Thine is the greatness and the independence, Thine is the pride and the sublimity, Thine is the glory and the invincibility, Thine is the power and the transcendence, Thine is the joy and the gladness, Thine is the sovereignty and the dominion, Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Cause and Thy creation. Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, being after all things, essence above all things, and creator beneath all things. Nothing escapeth Thy knowledge and nothing defeateth Thee. Thou hast ever been one God, single, self-subsisting, peerless, ever-living, self-sustaining, sovereign, supreme, holy, eternal, everlasting, inaccessible, exalted, all-powerful. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. Therefore, O my God, do Thou expand the breasts of them that are in the Bayan through the expansion of Thy grace, and cause to enter, O my God, all who are on earth into the paradise of Thy Faith, save that which is not according to Thy good-pleasure. For verily Thou hast ever been powerful over whatsoever Thou willest and supreme over whatsoever Thou desirest. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself through His exaltation above all contingent beings, and raised Himself through His elevation above all created things, and made Himself inaccessible through His inaccessibility above all existing things, and empowered Himself through His might above all atoms, and made Himself supreme through His supremacy above all who are in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and glorified Himself through His glory above all contingent things, and manifested Himself through His manifestation above all who are in the kingdoms of beginnings and endings. I testify, and all His creation doth testify, that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Encompassing. He hath chosen an impenetrable Essence, a radiant Abstraction, a manifest Purity, a lofty Camphor-like Nature, and a beautiful Form. Then He revealed Himself to it through it, and through it He became inaccessible from it, and He cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Then there appeared from it what was within it and upon it, whereupon the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them were filled thereby, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the One of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen for Him primary, essential names, then immersed them in the limitless, eternal ocean, whereupon existence, both unseen and seen, was filled thereby, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Expansive, the Most Expansive. The splendor from God be upon the First One and upon whosoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen except the First One. Furthermore, I testify that there is no Expander except God, exalted be His glory, and no Constrictor except Him, mighty be His might. This is of the conditions of good-pleasure, and this is of the conditions beneath good-pleasure. Observe in every Dispensation that whoso hath his breast expanded toward the Bearer of that Dispensation \[...\]

This is among the attributes beneath Ridvan. Consider how in every Dispensation whoso openeth wide his breast unto Him Who is the Manifestation thereof doth attain unto faith, whereas whoso remaineth veiled therefrom findeth his breast constricted. This constriction ariseth from his own veiling of himself. Yet doth God will expansion for both alike, and desireth not to constrict the heart of even an ant, much less one above it. But when one remaineth veiled - and God is the Creator of all things - if thou expandest the heart of any soul through guiding him unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily thine essence becometh expressive of that Name. Therefore cleave thou unto this attribute in the Days of Resurrection, for most of mankind are weak. If thou expandest their breasts and removest their doubts, they will enter into the Faith of God. Thou must needs manifest this attribute in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest with all the power thou possessest. For if thou expandest the heart of any soul in His Cause, this is better for thee than every deed, since deeds are but branches of faith in Him and certitude in His Reality. Be thou not veiled from this most exalted attribute and lofty geometry, and be not veiled from the shadow. For when thou expandest the heart of any soul, thou wilt behold a satan in human form constricting the heart of another, desiring to cast doubt upon the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore seek thou refuge in God thy Lord from paying heed to him, and hold fast unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. The proofs of truth from the Tree of Affirmation bear fruit through expansion, while the shadow from the Tree of Negation beareth fruit without expansion. Let this not weaken thee in thy fruit-bearing, for on the Day of Resurrection each shall reap according to his nature. Both are in the Bayan, but one is of His light and the other of His fire. Therefore seek refuge in His light from His fire, that thou mayest be saved on the Day of Resurrection among the sincere ones.Door Twenty-Six of Unity Twenty-Seven of Month Twenty-Seven of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name The Turner (Al-Mukawwir) which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Turner, the Most Turning. God - there is no God but He, the Turner, the Most Turning. Say: God turneth above all possessors of turning. None in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them can resist the sovereign power of His turning. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Turner, the Most Turning, the All-Turning. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God before Whom boweth down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him. God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. And verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or the earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things. And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will cause the night and day to revolve for a thousand thousand ages before this, that the night and day may continue for a thousand thousand ages after this. And thou shalt seek forgiveness from God for a thousand thousand of this and for a thousand thousand after this. There is no beginning nor end to this in the Book of God. All shall continue in infinity unto infinity, beginning and worshipping.God is the Creator of all things, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God is the Provider of all things, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God is the Slayer of all things, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God is the Quickener of all things, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. God is the Resurrector of all things, and He is the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.There is no God but God from the beginning that had no beginning, He Who hath ever been and ever shall be. And verily all that ye behold in the Bayan or in the Books sent down from heaven are attributed to the Exponents of God as they are attributed to God, that ye may be assured of the Cause of God and may manifest for His sake what ye desire. Otherwise, God is the Unseen, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, the Transcendent. No vision can grasp Him, but He graspeth all things by His command. He is the Sovereign, the Inaccessible, the Most High.All that is attributed to the Thrones of Truth is like that which is attributed to the House of God, the One, the Sovereign, the Most High. Be not veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, lest ye be veiled from God, the Lord of earth and heaven, the Lord of all things, the Lord of the seen and unseen, the Lord of the worlds of Command and Creation.In every Dispensation, regard not your numbers, whether many or few. For verily the Exponents of Truth, whether they be many or few, are in the right. Make not this your criterion, for those in error, whether many or few, warrant no attention. How much more when ye associate with them! But fear God, lest ye mistake truth for falsehood or falsehood for truth. Sharpen your vision, for ye shall all be tried upon that path.Had the possessors of the Gospel recognized Muhammad as the Truth from God and followed Him, none would have been veiled from Him. But they judged the Truth as they judged falsehood, thinking they did well. Likewise those given the Qur'an - had they recognized the Primal Point as the Truth from God, none would have been veiled from Him. But they judged concerning the Truth other than the Truth, after God and those endowed with knowledge had testified that He was indeed the Truth wherein there is no doubt, and that all were believers in Him.Look ye therefore to the proof, for by it shall ye be distinguished. Make not the proofs of the past your proof for Him Whom God shall manifest thereafter, lest ye be veiled from the path of God while thinking ye do well. Behold those given Islam - how many among them are Exponents who have perished, from among their learned ones, while thinking themselves to be in the right.

They have reckoned themselves to be upon the truth. If thou wouldst ponder the evidences of truth, thou wouldst testify that they are far removed from the path of God. Be watchful over yourselves in the Bayan, that ye may believe in the Primal Truth on the Day of Resurrection. This is He Whom God shall make manifest; ye are standing by God's command in His presence. Make not them who believe not in Him to be accounted among the truthful. These are they who are false, even though they ascend to the highest degrees of piety in their religion. And whoso transgresseth God's bounds amongst them - these are they whose deeds shall come to naught. Verily they are not upon the truth, but they who follow the degrees of guidance in the Bayan shall transform God's Cause through His proof. Therefore watch over yourselves, that ye may examine the words of every soul and then hold fast to the evidence of truth. And if ye find not truth in his words, dispute not with him, for verily We have forbidden in the Bayan that ye should dispute or argue, that on the Day of Resurrection ye may not argue or dispute with Him Whom God shall make manifest.This is a Book from God unto Him Whom God shall make manifest. Verily, there is no God but I, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. O Primal Will! If Thou wishest to witness the creation of fire and light, and art saddened by this and gladdened by that, then know Thyself and be among those who are manifest. And if Thou dost dispense with their gladness, so as not to witness their sorrow, then know Thyself as them and be among those who are hidden.Verily We have been content that they who have been given the Bayan should manifest naught before Thee save faith, that they may not be debarred from meeting Thee on the Day of Resurrection. But verily We know that they will not be certain of that which We have covenanted with them. And thou shalt see those who worship God throughout their lives and prostrate themselves before Thee - if they recognize Thee they will withhold from Thee even the word "yea", though they consider themselves to be at the highest degree of piety in their religion.If Thou wishest to bring those who are proofs of affirmation to the meeting with their Lord, then make Thyself known to them and be patient with what Thou witnessest from those who are transient. And if Thou wishest not to hear untrue words from those who are transient, then be independent of the praise of the affirmers, and make Thyself known in the Book however and whenever Thou wishest, then proclaim unto all the worlds with clear verses that render all the worlds impotent.We desired on the first day not to witness the sorrow of those who are transient, and We dispensed with the praise of those who affirm. But God hath willed that the Cause should be made manifest between fire and light, and We have been patient in God from the first moment We made all things to know Our Own Self through Our verses, and We were patient, until God shall make manifest His Cause to exalt His Word. Verily He hath power over all things. And God hath power over all things, the Inaccessible, the Most High. Nothing in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them can frustrate Him, and verily He hath power over all things.Let not the entreaties of those who have been given the Bayan or their devotions in their religion on the day of Thy manifestation deceive Thee, for most of them act without being aware. Muhammad, the Apostle of God, trained those who were given Islam for a thousand \[...\]

Let not the supplications and prayers of those who have been given the Bayan deceive thee on the Day of Thy Manifestation, for most of them act unknowingly. Muhammad, the Apostle of God, trained those who were given Islam for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, and they reached the utmost degree of their supplications and prayers for the Manifestation of God. But when We made Ourselves known unto them, behold what happened in the Bayan, and be thou of them that bear witness. Perchance several rulers in Islam possessed dominion on earth, and in their realms were countless numbers who claimed faith and prostrated themselves before Us. Yet when We made Ourselves known unto them through the proof of their own religion, they consented to confine Us to a mountain where no noble soul could be found, after they had, night and day, been supplicating for Our appearance and imploring Us. They perceive not the signs of faith and guidance manifest therein. They are born into a religion, wherein they witness what came before, and are thus reared, just as all nations who were given the Books of heaven aforetime are born into their faiths. They follow their religion through what they inherit, without reflection, understanding, remembrance or insight. And those who appear in the Bayan are like unto them, except that they stand in a truth from God and a mighty Book which accorded with their destiny, in that they stood firm in the truth and were upon a path of exalted truth. Otherwise they see not, nor do they reflect. If Thou makest Thyself known unto them when Thou dost manifest Thyself on the Day of Resurrection, they are like unto the nations before them who were reared in their religion to follow it. But when Thou wert among them, and Thy chosen ones were standing by Thy will - and there is no God but God and His names, and all worship Him - until such time as Thou didst manifest Thyself and draw Thy names from among the people of the Bayan, they were in truth and an exalted Book. But after Thou didst manifest Thyself and all Thy names were drawn to Thee among them, Thou seest naught in them save what Thou seest in those who were given the Book before them. They reflect not on their beginning nor their return, nor do they remember these. They begin from clay and unto clay do they return, and between these they act according to how they were reared. This is the extent of their knowledge and understanding. Verily We found them thus before in the Furqan, after We had resolved to show them that they should not be witnessed against as We had witnessed. Yet We were not assured concerning them. Whenever a Messenger came to any people, He desired to show them through the next Manifestation and to save them in their return, that they might perceive and understand the fruits of their beginning. But thou seest how all peoples remained in their religion, and had they understood the command of their beginning from their Messenger, they would not have perceived their return, nor would they reckon while thinking they do well. All creation belongeth unto Thee, and all else beside Thee subsisteth by God through Thee. If Thou causest all to enter the fire, Thou art the Most Just of the just, and if Thou causest all to enter Paradise, Thou art the Most Bountiful of the bountiful. For We have known no justice from God except what appeared from Thee, and Thou art the Veil of the Unseen from eternity, and We knew none besides Thee.

Verily Thou art the Veil of the Eternal Unseen; none but Thee have we recognized. We have witnessed naught of God's bounty save that which proceedeth from Thee, nor have we any path unto God from all eternity except that we should apprehend Thy bounty, for this is God's inaccessible and impregnable grace. All seek Thy call and in this do they glory.If Thou hast known Thyself, then be patient and grieve not, and rest assured in God, the Lord of all worlds. For gradually shall appear the fruits of the negation and affirmation of the Bayan, and verily Thou art most patient. And if Thou art independent of the fruits of affirmation, such that Thou seest not the fruits of the veils, the sincere guides shall not attain Thy presence. Deprive them not of God's good-pleasure, for verily Thou art the most bountiful of the bountiful.Thou art gladdened by their faith and recognition, and grieved by the veiling of those who claim faith in God their Lord while in God's Book they are among the perishing ones. The steadfast ones have received their portion from their Lord's Book, while the perishing ones are deprived of what they do for their Lord's good-pleasure though they worship Him night and day with sincere devotion.This is what We have taught thee in the Bayan, after We have witnessed from the Beginning that hath no beginning unto the End that hath no end that Thou art the most learned of the learned. Who is able to inform God his Lord of anything when God knoweth best what He hath created and will create, and God hath knowledge of all things?Yet We have revealed this that perchance they who are given the Bayan may remember their origin and return, that they may be ashamed in the light of their return unto God their Lord, and may not manifest what beseemeth Thee not. And if they believe not in Thee though they were created for this, let them not grieve Thee. And if they help Thee not, though they were all created for this, let none of Thy guides be grieved.This is what We have enjoined upon you, O people of the Bayan, concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest. Watch over yourselves, then be vigilant, for verily God your Lord shall come unto you while the angels surround Him, and He shall decree His command from His presence while ye are sleeping. That is the Day when He Whom God shall make manifest shall come, and they who are His guides shall distinguish between those who have been given the Bayan, while ye in your homes are imploring and beseeching.He shall manifest the Manifestation of His Self - indeed God hath manifested Him - yet ye believe not in Him with certitude. Like as God manifested Muhammad the Messenger of God while they who were given the Gospel awaited Him, though the term of the Book had expired beforehand and the Command of the Bayan came afterwards, yet at that time they were waiting. And they remember not.Let us then watch over ourselves in truth. The twenty-seventh Gate: To watch over the twenty-seventh Unity of the twenty-seventh Month of the Year in recognition of the name "The Turner."It hath four stations. The first in the first: In the name of God, the Most Turning, the Most Turning. God, there is no God but He, the Most Turning, the Most Turning. Say: God is more turning than any possessor of turning power. None can withstand the Sovereign King of His turnings, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Turner, the Turner, the Turner. Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth.

Praise be to God, before Whom all in the heavens and all on earth and whatsoever lieth between them bow down in adoration! Say: All are submissive unto Him. Praise be to God, before Whom all in the heavens and all on earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in devotion! Say: All are obedient unto Him. God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. His is the sovereignty and the kingdom, then the might and the dominion, then the power and the divine realm, then the strength and the celestial domain, then the dominion and the realm of creation. He giveth life and causeth death; then He causeth death and giveth life; and verily He is the Ever-living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Whose sovereignty passeth not away, the Just One Who deviateth not, the Ruler Whose rule changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He pleaseth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God causeth you to revolve in the kingdom of command and creation and whatsoever lieth between them, that ye may believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His manifestation and be assured thereof.Say: God hath indeed caused you to revolve from a beginning that hath no beginning unto what God hath brought you to this limit. Will ye not be thankful? And verily God will cause you to revolve thereafter as He pleaseth by His command. There is none other God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Will ye not consider the cycles which We have revealed from Our presence, how We have explained to you your creation in the Gate, that ye may believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection and be God-fearing?Will ye not consider that which descendeth from heaven, how it revolveth in the water? This is from the handiwork of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Thus doth God show you the cycles of what He hath created and will create, that ye may be God-fearing.Say: Verily in that Resurrection those cycles appeared in the houses of the spider, and We were witnesses thereof. Therefore watch over yourselves lest ye depart from the cycles of God's command, that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection.Know ye the truth by the truth and liken it not to aught else, for all that ye liken on the Day of Resurrection will cause your destruction, though ye suppose that ye do well. Will ye not consider those who were given the Gospel? When Muhammad, the Essence of creation, the Messenger of God, came unto them, they likened Him to other than the truth, and therefore followed Him not, supposing themselves to be God-fearing. Ye shall be tested in like manner in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest.Watch over yourselves, then be vigilant lest ye interpret what hath been revealed in the Bayan for yourselves regarding those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest in the same way as those who were given the Furqan interpreted the verses that were revealed concerning their rejection of those who believed in God and His signs, supposing themselves to be righteous in their interpretation. Nay, by no means! They have applied to those for whom naught but truth is befitting that which was not befitting for themselves, supposing within themselves that they were interpreters of righteousness. Nay, by no means! We revealed not a single letter in the Furqan save for good regarding those who believe not in the Primal Point.

They imagine themselves to be the interpreters of piety in their own estimation. By no means! No indeed! Not a single letter have We revealed in the Furqan that was not good save for those who believe not in the Primal Point. Such people interpret that which God hath revealed concerning those who believe in God and His verses, after We revealed every good thing regarding their mention, yet they perceive not. Similarly shall ye be tested on the Day of Resurrection. We have revealed no mention of good in the Book, nor have We created aught, except for those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and who recognize Him, who prostrate themselves before God, their Lord, by prostrating themselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest, and who are devoutly obedient unto Him. We have revealed no letter devoid of good except for those who veil themselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest in the days of His manifestation, yet imagine themselves to be pious witnesses. By no means! No indeed! These are they who are the unbelievers.Therefore watch yourselves, O people of the Bayan, lest ye exchange your light for fire after God hath admitted you into paradise and concealed you within the veils of this your night. Thus do We counsel you that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection. Say: In every manifestation, truth resideth only with the Primal Point and then His Letters, and ye stand forth through that which appeareth from Him. How then, when He appeareth again, will ye possess no truth except that which ye follow from His latter manifestation? Therefore testify that truth is with the Primal Point and then those who are proofs of God, their Lord - these are they who know.Whosoever writeth a letter with regard to Him Whom God shall make manifest, God will surely give him a thousand thousand good deeds as a bounty from His presence. Verily, there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Not during the length of your night, but rather at the time of His manifestation; otherwise during your night ye shall glorify as We have commanded you and aid Him. Yet when He maketh Himself known to you, ye recognize Him not. How then can ye aid or glorify? If ye be in doubt concerning this, observe those who were given the Gospel - all of them pray for the coming of one named Ahmad, and even now they pray, yet when He came with the truth they believed not in Him, until the term of the Book was fulfilled from His presence, and even now they wait. Then observe those who were given the Furqan - all of them pray for their Mahdi at all times, before and after, yet when God made Him manifest with clear signs, behold, they believed not in Him. They pray according to their own desires while claiming to pray for Him, not deviating their prayers from their own selves. Verily ye, O people of the Bayan, shall be tested similarly.The truth hath come from Him Whom God shall make manifest, and we all believe in Him. The heavens and earth and all between them shine with the splendor of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and we all give thanks to Him. This is a day when your essential realities shall be transformed into other realities in your understanding and in your religion. Therefore watch yourselves when God causeth you to understand. This is a Book from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. A prophet exalted before the number of Ra.

O followers of your Faith! Watch over yourselves when God turns you that ye may know this is a Book from God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. It is a Prophet of exalted rank before the number of Ra, Kaf, Ba and Alif, wherein appeareth the Most Great Name in the Book, for verily We are the Warners.O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, blessed thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning, until such time as We made known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize. And Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came with a Book from God, the Lord of all worlds.We witnessed that thou didst not follow the Truth from God, nor wert thou on the Day of Resurrection among those who remembered. And when thou heardst of the manifestation of Truth, thou didst not say "yea," and thus didst cast thyself into the fire with them that are veiled. Our proof hath been perfected against thee and against all the worlds by what We have revealed in the Book, for We are cognizant of all things.We revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can reveal a single verse, that perchance they who were given the Qur'an, when they hear a verse from His Proof at the time of His manifestation, might believe in it and remember. It is as though thou hadst not understood a single letter of the Qur'an, else thou wouldst have recognized the manifestation of God even as thou wert certain of thy Faith - nay, with greater certainty, if thou wert among the discerning ones.God revealed aforetime unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God, over twenty-three years, and ye all believe in it and are certain of it. If God so willeth, He can reveal unto His Proof in three days and nights, with no interval between their hours, for verily He hath power over all things.Behold how We have tried thee and those who were given the Qur'an, and We brought you forth by what We caused you to enter into your Faith, a command from Our presence, for We are just. How often did We counsel you to watch for the days of God, for verily ye shall be tried and purified. It is as though ye remembered not what We counseled you, but held fast to portions of your Faith that ye had fabricated therein, supposing that thereby ye would be saved.Thus doth God show you your deeds, and that they have borne no fruit from their roots, when ye judged His Proof without right, though ye judge among men in His Name. How oft did We reveal in the Qur'an aforetime: "Who doth greater wrong than he who forgeth a lie against God, his Lord?" And thou and they who have judged against their Lord's Proof - these are they who have forged a lie against God, these are the companions of the fire, and therein shall they find no helper.Thou hast worshipped God, thy Lord, throughout thy life and deemed thyself among the sincere, yet all thy worship bore not the fruit of saying "yea" to His Proof. Thus doth God render vain the work of those who have strayed from God's path, who are far removed from God's way.And verily the punishment of those who follow thee shall return unto thee after thy death. Wait thou, for thou shalt surely die, and thou shalt find in the fire no protector nor helper from God. And hadst thou said "yea" when thou didst behold a sign from among the signs of God, it would have been better for thee than all wherein thou hast striven in thy Faith.

If thou hadst uttered "yea" when thou didst behold a sign from among the signs of God, it would have been better for thee than all thy devotions in thy faith, wherein thou didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing. We created thee for Our meeting on the Day of Resurrection, and We did attend that land, yet We witnessed naught from thee save that for which thou wast created, for thou wert among the veiled ones. Thus did he withhold thee from the meeting with His Self, after thou wast created for it. Verily, He hath ever been just, equitable and wise.Behold how the servants of truth did beguile thee and took from thee what thou hadst written concerning the words of the Imam Rida, the sublime True One, after thou wert among the believers in thy faith. Thus doth God make manifest the inner reality of those who believe not in God nor in the One Who revealed the Qur'an, though they account themselves believers.If thou shouldst return unto God, thy Lord, and seek forgiveness of God Who created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die and gave thee life, God may perchance transform thy negation into affirmation. Verily, He hath ever been forgiving, wise.And if thou hadst waited until the matter was decided, that which was revealed would have been made clear through its verses by servants exalted and sublime. And if thou hadst remembered, thou wouldst have been among the saved ones.That thou mayest not be tormented after thy death throughout all eternity, thou shouldst write an epistle unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking forgiveness therein from God, thy Lord, and thou shouldst enjoin the sincere servants of God to ensure it reaches Him, that what thou hast written unto Him may be spread before Him Whom God shall make manifest. God may perchance pardon thee and transform thy fire into light. Verily, He is the Pardoner, the Forgiver, the Forgiving.This is an epistle from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Inform in the Book the son of Ali, for verily We have ever been among those who give tidings. O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning unto an end that hath no end, that thou mightest recognize thyself and be among those who attain unto knowledge. We made Ourself known unto thee through Our signs, yet We found thee not among those who know God their Lord and believe in His signs.Verily, I am Muhammad, your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi, the One concerning Whom ye were promised. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those in that land that ye might believe in God and His signs and be assured.When ye heard of the appearance of the Truth yet failed to say "yea," your light was transformed into fire in the Book of God. Except if ye return unto God and become of those who seek forgiveness.As Our proof was perfected concerning thee in the Qur'an, so hath it been perfected thereafter in the Bayan. There is no altering that which hath been sent down from God - verily, we all believe in it.That which God revealed unto Muhammad, the Messenger of God, over twenty-three years, and in which ye all believe - if God so desired, He could reveal the equivalent thereof unto His Proof in two days and two nights were there no interval between their hours. Verily, He hath power over all things.We revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can reveal a single verse, that perchance those given the Qur'an might remember when they hear the verses of God and then believe in them both. We created those given the Qur'an for the day of meeting with Us.

Two nights when no hours separate between them, verily He hath power over all things. We have sent down in the Furqan that none other than God can reveal a single verse, that perchance those who have been given the Furqan, when they hear the verses of God, may remember and then believe in them both. We created those who were given the Furqan for the day of meeting with Us, but We found you not believing therein. You have exalted yourself with the names of truth from Our presence, then passed judgment upon God, your Lord, by what you have judged His Manifestation, and deemed yourself among the God-fearing. Nay, nay! Those who have judged God their Lord - these are they whom nothing of their deeds shall profit, and they shall enter the fire after their death, and therein shall they find no help. You have studied throughout your life, yet the tree of your knowledge has not yielded the word "yea" unto God, the Lord of all worlds, even though you have worshipped God your Lord throughout your life and have been among those who prostrate themselves before Us night and day. Verily those who have ascended in the knowledge of their religion and deemed themselves advancing in their knowledge have not comprehended a single letter of the knowledge of God, and if they had comprehended it, their knowledge would return to the proof of their Lord. They have ascended in the air of their imagination and written words from themselves that have no meaning with God, and they know it not. They follow their own way, and if they knew God their Lord, they would have known the proof of their Lord, and if they wrote in praise of God what they have composed in their books, they would praise the proof of their Lord. We have rendered them and their deeds as though they had done nothing, and verily We are witness over all things. And verily those who have invented principles in their religion and deemed themselves learned and God-fearing - they are like those others who have not understood a single letter from the Book of God. Both of them follow their own desires. And their example is like those who were given the Gospel - had they understood what God revealed therein when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them, they would have believed in Him and would have been convinced of the verses of God from His presence. But when they did not comprehend anything of the meaning of their Book, when the meaning of God's Book came to them, they veiled themselves and immersed themselves in words that had no spirit with God, and they deemed themselves good-doers while they still wait in their religion. And if you wish to save yourself before the matter is decreed, then return unto God your Lord, for We are forgiving. And if you wait until what has been revealed in the Book is fulfilled - its verses have been made firm and all shall believe in them until the Day of Resurrection. And verily those who believe not in it have no spirit to perceive what has been revealed in the Book, while those who have been given knowledge from their Lord all believe in it. And after that, if you remember, then write a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and enjoin that it reach the sincere servants of God, and seek forgiveness of God your Lord therein; perhaps God will change the negative into the positive from His presence, for He is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. The twenty-eighth chapter of the seventh Unity.

In the name of God, the Most Gracious!The seventh and twentieth of the First, and the seventh and twentieth of the seventh month, and the seventh and twentieth of the year, concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Ever-Developing," which hath four stations. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Developing, the Most Developing! God! There is no God but He, the Most Developing, the Most Developing! Say: God is more developing than all possessors of development. None can withhold himself from the dominion of the Sovereign Lord of Development, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Developer, the Developing, the Most Developed.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, before Whom singeth praise whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but He. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Force and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is powerful over all things.Blessed be He before Whom singeth praise whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.Say: Verily God will manifest unto you the stages of His holiness if ye, on the Day of Resurrection, believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest.O all souls! Ye shall surely perform what ye perform that God, your Lord, may be well-pleased with you. Be not veiled on the Day of Resurrection, by what ye perform, from Him Whom God shall make manifest, but hold fast unto His good-pleasure. For that which will save you on the Day of Resurrection is not what ye perform, though if ye act in accordance with this verse ye shall be saved in every Resurrection and shall not be veiled by what ye have done. O all things! Hold fast unto this verse that ye may, perchance, be saved thereby on the Day of Resurrection. Ye have no god but God - He is your Lord, unto Whom belongeth creation and command.There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.He is the One Who createth what He willeth by His command "Be!" and it is.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, and the Manifest over His servants, and He is the Single, the Impregnable, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: He is the One Who standeth over every soul. He knoweth what it hath earned and witnesseth what it shall earn. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.He is the One before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, we are all prostrate before Him.And He is the One before Whom singeth praise whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, we are all devoted unto Him.Say: Glorified be God, the Possessor of every particle of what He hath created and shall create. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto the divines who dwell in the land of Ya, who reckon themselves perceiving in their religion \[...\]

This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved. Inform the divines who dwell in the Land of Ya, who imagine themselves enlightened in their religion, though God beareth witness that they are far removed from His path. We created you, sustained you, caused you to die, and gave you life from a beginning that hath no beginning, until We made Ourselves known to you through Our signs, that ye might be among those who recognize. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto you that ye might, on the Day of Resurrection, save yourselves from the fire. They who have believed in God from that time, these are they who have attained. These are they who have comprehended the bounty of their Lord, and these are they who are guided. Their faith is a testimony against those who have veiled themselves from the path of God while supposing they do well. Our proof is complete against you even as it was completed in the Qur'an, if ye would but reflect. Consider in your religion: ye have not seen Muhammad, the Messenger of God, nor those who were witnesses after Him, nor have ye witnessed any sign which all the world would be powerless to produce, save what was revealed in the Qur'an. It is indeed a supreme Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. As ye were convinced when ye beheld the Qur'an, ye have no choice but to be convinced when ye behold the signs of God in this Book, would ye but perceive. All of you have worshipped your Lord, the Lord of the heavens and of the earth, the Lord of all things visible and invisible, the Lord of all worlds, and unto Us were ye prostrating. Yet when We made Ourselves known to you, the tree of your faith yielded not the fruit of "Yea." Those who did believe were not of you, and they are the guides of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Were it not for them, God would neither have created you, nor sustained you, nor caused you to die, nor given you life, but ye are veiled from the cause of your own existence in your likes. When ye heard of the Manifestation of God, ye exchanged your light for fire. Return ye unto God, your Lord, and repent unto Him. This is Muhammad, your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi, Who was promised unto all. This is He Whose covenant prayer the holy ones recite every morning, longing to give their lives in His path, beseeching and supplicating. Yet when We made Ourselves known to you, ye recognized Us not. How then can ye believe, or be convinced, or help, or be raised up before God? O thou who art present! God, thy Lord, shall question thee about thyself and about those who have veiled themselves in that land and who follow thee, thinking they are on the right path and that they comprehend the path of God. When thou heardst of the Manifestation of God, had thou said "Yea," it would have been better for thee than all thy worship of God throughout thy life, even hadst thou been among the discerning. When thou beholdest any of Our signs, thou shouldst say without doubt: "This is from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We were indeed convinced concerning the Qur'an that none but God could reveal a single verse." \[...\]

"Wert thou of them who possess insight, when thou didst behold a single one of Our signs thou wouldst assuredly declare: 'Verily this is from God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.' We have indeed attested in the Qur'an that none but God can reveal a single verse, and in this we are both witnessing and hearing. Were We to declare it to be from other than God, We would have disbelieved in that which We had attested in the Qur'an, and were We not to declare this, the proof would be established against Us that We were believers in that which God had revealed. Consider: hadst thou learned the knowledge of the Bayan, thou wouldst have comprehended this mystery. But thou hast learned vain imaginings that profit thee not the weight of a hair. O thou! All that thou hast learned in thy religion returns to that which God thy Lord hath commanded, otherwise it profiteth thee not, wert thou of them who possess insight.And thy Lord God hath commanded no knowledge save that thou shouldst believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and if that which We commanded thee before or after preventeth thee from believing in Him at the time of His manifestation, then never shall it benefit thee. Therefore observe the bounds of your religion lest ye be veiled by its ordinances from Him Who createth them by His command, for verily ye shall be tested in this on the Day of Resurrection. If thou desirest salvation, then return unto God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. Thou canst not return unto God except by returning unto the Primal Point and those who guide unto Him. Were Ahmad the servant to follow on the Day of Resurrection, he would surely save thee among the believers. But thou hast taken pride in thy knowledge and been veiled from the Essence that is with Him, and thou hast imagined thyself to be among the saved ones.The likeness of what thou possessest is as a thousand weights of clay compared to one weight of silver. Hadst thou possessed that essence, it would have sufficed thee instead of all that clay, and thou wouldst have been saved on the Day of Resurrection among the God-fearing ones. But that clay will never suffice thee instead of this. Thus doth God thy Lord show thee the essence of knowledge apart from it, O ye who are endowed with learning, that ye may fear God.If thou returnest unto God when the verses are sent down from God, the Mighty, the Beloved, We shall surely forgive thee through Our grace, for We are ever-forgiving. But if the matter is concluded, thou shalt find no way unto that, even if thou rememberest and desirest to be among the saved ones. Therefore write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness from God thy Lord, and enjoin that should any of the believers reach Him, it be spread before God thy Lord on the day of His manifestation. Perchance God may pardon thee, for He is indeed the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.Verily God shall question on the Day of Resurrection concerning the veiling of those who follow their divines from their divines, and shall return unto them what hath been ordained for them, and they shall themselves be questioned. O concourse of cattle! Ye follow your divines because God your Lord hath commanded it, but how is it that when God your Lord forbiddeth you from following them on the day of the manifestation of His Self, ye follow them not? Do ye not observe those who were given knowledge, how their divines and their followers have entered Paradise, wherein they take their ease? But ye have remained patient with your divines and have supposed that in your patience ye were sincere.This is what God hath testified concerning you after ye have spent your entire lives in toil that perchance ye might attain somewhat of God's good-pleasure. Therefore follow ye those who have followed in that land."

And ye have reckoned that in your patience ye are sincere. But this is what God hath witnessed concerning you, after ye have spent your entire lives in toil that perchance ye might attain unto something of God's good-pleasure. Follow, then, them who have followed in that land, they who were of them that were certain of God and His signs. For verily they shall deliver you from the fire if ye hold fast unto their guidance.Say: God is One above all who possess oneness. None in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them can withhold himself from the dominion of the sovereignty of His oneness. Verily He hath ever been the One, the Alone, the Single.We have not sent down from the Name at this time aught but a path for all who are in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. If ye hold fast unto this, ye shall, verily, be among them that shall be saved on the Day of Resurrection.The Second in the SecondIn the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, the might and the grandeur, the power and the divinity, the strength and the sovereignty, the majesty and the glory, the countenance and the beauty, the face and the perfection, the strength and the deeds, the mercy and the bounty, the might and the justice, the likeness and the examples, the stations and the sublimity, the greatness and the independence, the grandeur and the manifestation and the revelation, the glory and the inaccessibility, the power and the exaltation, the joy and the gladness, the sovereignty and the authority.Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation. Thou hast ever been the Possessor of the inaccessible sovereignty, the exalted might, the all-compelling wisdom, the all-powerful sign, the all-possessing riches, and the names which none besides Thee can reckon, and the supreme examples which none save Thee can comprehend. Thou hast ever been existing before all things, and established above all things, and subsisting with all things, and the Creator apart from all things.Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Alone, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Compelling, Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created, nor any helper in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power hast Thou created all things and ordained them by Thine ordering, and by Thy will hast Thou fashioned all things and formed them by Thy forming.Thou hast ever been knowing of all things, ruling over all things, king over all things, sovereign over all things, and independent above all things. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth not anything in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The ThirdIn the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted, in the Third!Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all created things, and ascended in His ascension above all existing things, and become inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, and become supreme in His supremacy above all who are in the kingdom of earth \[...\]

By His dominion He wieldeth power over all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and through His revelation all created things are made manifest, and through His sovereignty He ruleth over all who dwell in the kingdoms of the beginning and the end, and through His riches He is independent of all who dwell in the kingdoms of the first and the last, and through His glory He shineth above all who dwell in the kingdoms of the outer and the inner. He hath called all His creation to bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Glorious. He hath chosen an exalted Essence, a radiant Reality, a lofty Purity, a resplendent Crystal, and a beauteous Form. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, and through it He withdrew from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Then there appeared from it what was within and upon it, and the heavens and earth and all that lieth between them were filled thereby, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the One of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen Him for Himself and chosen for Him primary and essential names, then immersed them in the sea of infinite eternity. Thus was existence filled from the ocean of the unseen and the seen, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling.The Fourth in the FourthThe Self-Subsisting. In the Name of God, in the Name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. And verily the glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One wherein naught is seen save the First One. I testify that there is no Glorifier save God, exalted be His glory, and no Establisher save Him, mighty be His might. Knowest thou the Glory or not? These are the attributes of Him Whom God shall make manifest. He is glorified through His most exalted and most inaccessible glory, like unto the colors of the Peacock of eternity. If thou attainest unto the days of the Manifestation of God, thou shalt surely make each aspect of His glory a gate of knowledge from among the inaccessible sciences, for these are the glories of the Tree of Divinity, which hath no like, no similitude, no peer, no equal, and no counterpart. Verily God, glorified be He, doth manifest the sign of the inaccessible to the extent of Qaf and Nun and Dhal beyond its limit, and adjusteth it according to the number of the name of the Ancient. Say: Unto God belongeth the sweetness, the two sweetnesses, the sweetness of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Sweetener, the Powerful, the Mighty. Unto God belongeth the Ancient, the two ancients, the ancient of the heavens and earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Most Ancient, the Powerful, the Mighty.If thou art glorified in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily thine essence deriveth from that Most Glorious Name and Most Exalted Glory. Make thyself therefore as a mirror reflecting the glory of Him Whom God shall make manifest, wherein naught is seen save Him. If thou attainest unto this station, thou art indeed among the perfect ones. Otherwise, though thou shouldst learn every science, it shall profit thee not unless thou makest thyself like unto this. Thy claims in the unseen shall profit thee not unless thou art united with the Day of Manifestation. If in the Manifestation thou realizest that which thou didst claim in the unseen, then verily it behooveth that the name of humanity be mentioned in relation to thee. Understand thou this, for this is the transcendent and lofty glory, and the sublime and exalted majesty. Say: God hath willed. There is no power save in God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Then say: Whatever God hath willed. There is no\[...\]

Say: God hath willed! There is no power except through God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Then say: Whatever God willeth! There is no might nor power except through God.The First Door of the Eighth Unity and the Tenth of the Eighth Month and the Tenth of the Year concerning the knowledge of the Name of the Most Powerful, which hath four ranks. The first, in the name of God, the Most Powerful of the powerful. The First: God, there is no God but He, the Most Powerful, the Most Powerful.Say: God is more powerful than all who possess power. None can withstand the sovereignty of His dominion's might, neither in the heavens nor on earth nor whatsoever is between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Strong.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down before Him. And praise be to God, before Whom singeth glorification whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been powerful over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall ordain as He willeth by His command. He hath ever been the All-Wise Doer. Say: Verily the Bayan differeth according to how ye arrange it. One kind hath been revealed from the Primal Point, and one kind ye write and arrange in Arabic what was revealed in the foreign tongue, and one kind wherein ye are permitted to interpret in the foreign tongue that which was revealed by those who speak the tongue of God, and one kind wherein ye arrange all that was revealed therein in the most excellent manner ye are able to arrange and attract.Say: Verily the Bayan is the name of the verses, and other matters are gathered beneath its shade. And were ye to be guided by the verses themselves, We would not have revealed these matters. But We have witnessed your veils and have shown mercy unto you through clear and decisive words that ye might be guided thereby. Otherwise it beseemeth not God to speak with His own words where all the worlds stand powerless. Verily there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto those who are in the Land of Kaf from among their learned ones, for We have ever been those Who announce therein the evidences of God, the Lord of the heavens \[...\]

This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Point of the Dawn (Primal Point). Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved.Tell those who dwell in the Land of Kaf among their divines that We are indeed those who guide therein the proofs of God, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of all worlds.For them therein are elevated stations wherein they ascend, and verily God shall question those in that land concerning their divines, that perchance they may be guided by their guidance.Blessed are they who have followed the remembrance of Our Self, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God endureth above all who endure. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His sovereignty. Verily, He is the Eternal, the Everlasting, the Enduring.Those who have followed the path of their Lord in that land, these are they who are guided by God's guidance. They shall enter Paradise after their death, and in their lives they rejoice in their Lord's good-pleasure.God shall send down upon them blessings from heaven, and these shall ascend in the Most Great Paradise. Therein they shall have from their Lord whatsoever they desire, and He shall increase it for them from His presence at all times, before and after.Verily, there is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved.O Ahmad! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this time, that We might make Our Self known to thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be of those who recognize. We have sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those in that land that perchance they who were given the Criterion might remember for the appearance of their Lord and then the Day of Resurrection, that they might be saved.Bear thou witness that there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And verily I am Muhammad, your Guardian and Guide, and We guide those who were given the Criterion, all of whom were promised this.Those who have followed Me, these are they who are guided. And those who have veiled themselves from the manifestation of their Lord, these are they against whom their Lord's proof hath been completed, and these are they who are veiled from God's path.We created thee and every soul for the day of meeting with Us, and We sent down revelation upon thy land, yet We found thee not among those assured of meeting thy Lord. Had thou said "Yea" when thou didst hear God's verses, it would have been better for thee than all thy lifetime's worship of God thy Lord, and thou wouldst have been among those who prostrate themselves before Us.Thou didst acquire knowledge thinking to be saved thereby on the Day of Resurrection, yet thou wast veiled by it and deemed thyself among the God-fearing. We shall question thee concerning those who followed thee, for We are ever-questioning.Have ye not considered how the companions of Paradise followed what was revealed from their Lord? These are they who believe in it and are assured. Yet after ye heard, how ye have become, and ye have not made yourselves like those who were given knowledge in God's Book, and they believe in God's signs.Our proof was completed against thee when thou didst hear a single verse from God, if thou art of those who reflect. From the beginning that hath no beginning until this time, God hath sent no messenger who sends to anyone from words \[...\]

And Our testimony has been perfected upon thee when thou didst hear a verse from God, if thou art of them that reflect. From the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, God hath not sent forth any Messenger who would send unto anyone of His words and establish the testimony of his Lord upon him through whatsoever verses God would reveal unto him. This is what God hath distinguished His Manifestation with among all the worlds. Whosoever desireth to be guided by the verses of God from Muhammad, the Messenger of God, must present himself before him until he heareth the verses of his Lord. And Muhammad did not reveal unto anyone the verses of his Lord to establish His testimony upon him through what was revealed unto him. But verily We are powerful over that. When We write unto anyone a book to establish Our testimony upon him, like unto what We established in the Qur'an, when thou witnesseth a verse from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, thou shalt reject what thou wert certain of in thy religion. Is there aught else than what thou hast seen in the Qur'an and witnessed regarding the powerlessness of all the worlds? Similarly, when thou beholdest this Book, if thou wert to gain insight through it, thou wouldst become certain of it like unto what thou wert certain of before. And before thou sawest Muhammad and heardst from him, now thou seest not the Primal Point to hear from Him. Equal unto thee is Our testimony from before and after, if thou art of them that possess insight. We have revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can reveal a single verse, and We were patient with them for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, that perchance when they hear the verses of God from His Testimony they might remember them and then become certain. We have witnessed those who were given the Qur'an, that they have not remained steadfast upon what We revealed therein, and they have veiled themselves from that which establisheth their religion, and they have clung to parts of their religion and striven therein, supposing they were doing good. Nay, nay! Nothing of their deeds shall profit them, and all their deeds are established after their belief in God and then in His Testimony after His Testimony. How can their deeds profit them with God while We were witness over them that they were veiled from the path of God? And what thy father wrote shall not profit him with God, and verily We were among them that store up. But had he comprehended Our verses and veiled himself as thou hast veiled thyself, nothing whatsoever of what they do would profit him. All that they do returneth unto the good-pleasure of God, and the good-pleasure of thy Lord is manifested only through the good-pleasure of His Testimony. This is that whereby all shall be tried on the Day of Resurrection, then shall they be brought low. Read thou the third verse of the Surih of Thunder and reflect upon it, how We have made the cause of the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them to be your certitude and the meeting with your Lord, while ye yourselves are veiling yourselves from that for which God hath created all things, and ye suppose that ye are among the God-fearing. Return thou unto God thy Lord if thou desirest to be among the guided ones. Otherwise, We are indeed independent of all things. And if thou rememberest after the Cause hath been decreed and desirest to be among the saved ones, then be thou content with the guides of thy Lord in that land and write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest.

Write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and entrust it to one of the believers that he may deliver it unto Him, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and be thou of them that repent, that it may be spread before God. Perchance God will change thy denial into affirmation, and will pardon thee in His Book, and will make mention of thee in truth. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.This is a Book from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. There is no God but the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Do thou inform him who is learned in that land, for We are of them that give knowledge. O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this time, that We might make known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mayest be of them that recognize.We have sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto them that are in that land, that those unto whom the Criterion was given by their Lord might remember the days of their Lord and be among the triumphant on the Day of Resurrection.We did not witness thee following the truth as We revealed it, and though thou didst see the Messengers of God, it profiteth thee not, since thou didst not gain certitude in what was revealed in the Book, and thou didst persist without right or enlightening Book.Thou didst worship God thy Lord at all times, before and after. Yet hadst thou followed the word of the Messenger and manifested guidance when thou didst hear it, it would have been better for thee than all thy worship of God thy Lord throughout thy life when thou didst strive to be of the diligent.And when thou didst witness a sign, Our proof was completed against thee even as it was completed against those who were given the Criterion aforetime, and We were witness to all things.Consider that wherein thou didst gain certitude in thy religion and be thou among the believers therein, save that thou didst witness the Criterion and bore witness to the powerlessness of all upon the earth, then wert among them that were certain.Otherwise thou didst not see any Prophet, nor Imam, nor Gate, nor genuine sign before which all the world would prove powerless, except that thou didst witness the Criterion and wert guided by it, then gained certitude in what God thy Lord revealed therein, and wert among the believers.And thou didst follow the truth without having witnessed thine own powerlessness and the powerlessness of all the world. Thou wert not endowed with insight in following the truth, though previously in thy life thou wert certain thou wert in an exalted true religion.But God will question thee about how thou didst enter thy religion, lest thou sayest: "I bore witness to my powerlessness and the powerlessness of all the world when I saw the Criterion." How wilt thou answer God thy Lord after following the truth without insight or manifest proof?And if thou sayest: "I bore witness to my powerlessness and the powerlessness of all the world, then gained certitude that it was from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting," then God will use the Bayan as proof against thee, how thou didst witness thy powerlessness and the powerlessness of all the world after We revealed it from Our presence, and We were powerful over all things.We have revealed the Criterion \[...\]

Verily We have power over all things. We have sent down the Qur'an and revealed therein that none besides God can reveal verses, so that those who have been given the Qur'an, when on the Day of Resurrection they hear the verses of God, they might believe in them and be assured. All have veiled themselves by the ordinances of their religion and clung to portions of what was revealed in their Faith, not comprehending that this will not benefit them in establishing their religion. How can it be, when they veil themselves from He Who created both them and their religion? How can portions of their religion benefit them when they act by day and night yet reflect not on their deeds? Would you act except to follow God's good-pleasure as revealed in the Qur'an, if you be of the believers? And can God's good-pleasure be manifested through aught but the good-pleasure of what He reveals in His Book, if you be of the discerning ones? Each soul imagines it attains God's good-pleasure, yet God bears witness to none save those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection and who act according to His behest. These are they to whom God has testified guidance and His Own good-pleasure, and these are the triumphant ones. Behold how many divines have gloried in Our names during Our absence, yet when We made Ourselves known to them in Our manifestation, it was as though they knew Us not. How then can they believe in what God has revealed or be assured in God's religion? We have rendered them and their deeds as the day We created them, and they shall return to dust, then shall they not be remembered in truth. Consider that if you had followed the Truth, how many servants would have followed you, and you would have led them into Paradise by your guidance and made them among the triumphant. But you have veiled yourself and those who follow you are veiled, and what has been ordained for them in their Lord's Book shall return to you. Therefore have mercy on yourself, then on them, that you may save them. For this is from God's grace upon you, after God has testified to your veiling in the Book. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Excellent, the Most Gracious. If you remember before the matter is decreed and return to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, perhaps God will transform the fire into light in the Book. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Otherwise you shall surely die and possess nothing, and shall find before God your Lord neither protector nor helper. And if you remember after the matter is decreed what We have revealed in the Book whose verses have been made firm by an exalted and sublime Sovereign, then be content with those who guide unto God your Lord in your land, and write a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and ensure it reaches Him through one of the believers. Perhaps God will forgive your veiling yourself on the Day of Resurrection from meeting your Lord, and transform your negation into affirmation through His grace. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. And through a single book containing a single verse, God's proof shall be completed and perfected for all who dwell on earth, if they would but reflect and reason from what they possessed before. Blessed are they who remember in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest.

Assuredly it shall be fulfilled upon all who are on earth, if they would but ponder thereon and draw evidence from what they already possess. Blessed are they who remember in the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest, who return unto the proof of their Lord, and who believe in Him and are assured.The Second Gate of the Twenty-eighth Unity concerning the knowledge of the name of Rain, which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Rainy of the Rainy. God, there is no God but He, the Most Rainy of the Rainy. Say: God is the Most Rainy above all possessors of rain. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His raining sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Rain-Giver, the Rain-Sender, the Rain-Bestower.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, Whom all glorify who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Might and the Grandeur, the Power and the Divinity, the Strength and the Sovereignty, and the earthly realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God sendeth down from heaven that whereby ye plant in the earth. The earth is quickened after its death thereby, and ye possess what ye love thereby. Say: Who sendeth down the rains through the clouds, if ye but knew? And who sendeth down the showers through the clouds, if ye but witnessed? And who sendeth down the snow through the clouds, if ye but perceived? And who sendeth down the frozen water through the clouds, if ye would but reflect a little?Say: God verily sendeth down all of that through the angels of the heavens and earth and what lieth between them. And God is the Snow-Sender, the Snow-Giver, the Snow-Bestower.Say: Verily God hath created servants whose hearts are like unto snow. When God manifesteth Himself unto them, they manifest themselves accordingly, and they are transformed by whatever veil toucheth them. Fear ye God, lest ye cause them grief, for they are whiter than snow in their heart's countenance, grieving at the mention of any save Him Whom God shall make manifest. And that which God created in them of the color of whiteness is altered. Fear ye God, lest ye mention in the presence of the first ones aught save holy glorification.Say: Glory be to God above what ye say! Say: Verily, He Whom God shall make manifest is exalted above those whom ye mention, save those who praise Him Whom God shall make manifest according to what hath been revealed from His presence - these are the sincere ones. Peace be upon them from their Lord for what they praise according to their understanding.

Say: Glory be to God above that which ye utter! Say: He Whom God shall make manifest is exalted above those whom ye mention, save those who praise Him Whom God shall make manifest according to what hath been revealed from His presence - these are they who are sincere. Peace be upon them from their Lord, inasmuch as they praise according to their understanding. Otherwise, it beseemeth not Him Whom God shall make manifest that any should praise Him among all the worlds. This is the Spirit of God - and who is able to praise God his Lord after having been created by His command and subsisting by His command?Consider ye how those who are veiled from His presence utter that which God would be ashamed to mention, while they themselves seek to sanctify their Lord yet do not perceive. When they say "Glory be to God and exalted is He above what they describe" - this is what they falsely attribute in mentioning Him Whom God shall make manifest, even while they glorify Him night and day. God will seize them for all that they utter without exalting His remembrance and the power of His Word - a severe seizure from His presence, for verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.Say: Throughout your nights ye glorify and praise, yet when He cometh unto you, ye utter that which God would be ashamed to mention. What aileth you, O people, that ye do not understand His Cause, nor remember, nor marvel at this? Indeed those who were given the Gospel praised Muhammad, the Apostle of God, yet when He came to them they said "This is mere madness." And those who were given the Furqan praised what they were promised regarding their Qa'im, yet when He came to them with guidance and truth, God would be ashamed to mention their words. Say: Glory be to God and exalted is He above what all speakers utter together, except those who have recognized God their Lord, then the Primal Point, then Him, believing and being certain.Watch over yourselves lest ye praise Him Whom God shall make manifest, then when He cometh with guidance and truth, ye earn that which God would be ashamed to mention, after having praised Him. Say: The rain-showers of the heaven of divinity are the verses of God from the presence of the Primal Tree, whereby the soil of your hearts, spirits, souls and bodies is quickened, and ye are all adorned by the words of God. Make not the soil of your hearts like dead earth after God hath quickened you through His remembrance, if ye be of those who are alive and guided. Those who hear the words of God from Him Whom God shall make manifest and believe in that instant - the soil of their hearts, spirits, souls and bodies is living. When God sendeth down rain upon it, it is quickened after having been veiled in the night. God showeth you His signs - His signs on the Day of Resurrection that ye may give life to yourselves.Those who hear the words of God from Him Whom God shall make manifest yet accept not the fruits of guidance and faith - God loveth not to mention them. Their likeness is as earth that sprouteth no goodly vegetation however much rain falleth upon it, but only thistles. O all ye earth! Would that ye might love on the Day of Resurrection and be saved!

They who lack faith shall not be accepted; these are they whom God loveth not to mention. They are like unto soil which, no matter how much rain falleth upon it, will never yield goodly vegetation, though verily it may bring forth thorns. O all ye lands! Perchance ye may, on the Day of Resurrection, find love and attain deliverance! Guard ye the rains that fall from the heaven of your bodies, for verily from a single drop thereof is created an angel, mighty and powerful, should ye descend upon the lands of life. This is of God's bounty and mercy unto you, that perchance ye may benefit from the fruits that descend from heaven. And whoso is able to cause the water of life to fall upon land, creating thereby an exalted and elevated human being, or a mighty and impregnable word, yet withholdeth himself - God will surely question him concerning that which could have been manifested through either of these, and how he hath prevented what God had willed to create thereby. O ye possessors of rain, fear ye God! O ye possessors of leaves, spring ye forth! O ye possessors of fruits, appear ye from between them! Glorify ye God Who hath created you, sustained you, caused you to die, and brought you to life, and unto Whom ye shall return.This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto those who dwell in the land of Qaf and Mim as knowers that We have created you, sustained you, caused you to die, and brought you to life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, that ye might recognize Our Selves and be among those who know. We have sent the Messenger and revealed the Book for those who desire to be guided. Those who have believed in God and His signs - these are they who have attained. For them in the Paradise of Ridvan is whatsoever they ask of their Lord's bounty. God aideth them through His angels of the heavens and paradise, and they rejoice in their sacred chambers. All that they love appeareth before them more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, as the angels of paradise attend them, glorifying God with praise of their Lord while they rise to exalted stations.Those who have veiled themselves from the Manifestation of God when they heard - these are they who have exchanged their light for the fire of their veils, supposing they do good. Nay, nay! Our proof hath been perfected against them even as it was perfected against those who were given the Furqan aforetime, yet they remember not in the days of God, nor do they reflect. Say: When ye have heard a verse or witnessed it, Our proof hath been perfected against you, if ye would but reflect a little on the verses of God. We revealed aforetime in the Furqan that none but God can reveal a verse, that perchance those who were given the Furqan might, after years of darkness, remember when they hear God's verses, and then believe. Ye have clung to the branches of your religion while veiling yourselves from the proof unto which your entire religion returneth, thinking that ye shall not be brought before Us on the Day of Resurrection. Look ye then upon the third verse of the Surih of Thunder, and ye shall witness. God hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and every soul for the day of meeting with its Lord, yet after We have made Our Selves known unto you, ye are not certain of that meeting for which ye were created. Ye attend a seat that hath been raised by the command of the veil of Ya \[...\]

But after We made known Our own Selves unto you through the encounter for which ye were created, still do ye not attain unto certitude. Ye present yourselves in a seat that was raised by the command of the Veil of the Letter Ya, and verily its mention was exalted by command of the First Veil, and His religion was established through what God revealed unto Him of verses and clear proofs, yet from Him upon Whom God bestowed such evidence do ye remain veiled. Then, after numbered veils, ye reckon that ye attain unto God's good-pleasure. Yea, should ye attain unto the presence of God while ye cause Us grief, on the Day of Resurrection We shall assuredly give you the recompense of your presence there. We shall surely give you the reward of your presence before the Veil of the Letter Ya, when ye stood there before God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. But at that time naught shall profit you save that ye return unto your Lord's proof and seek forgiveness. Should ye attain unto the days of God and return unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, through your return unto your Lord's proof, then shall ye attain unto every good thing that hath been sent down from God in the Book, and after your death ye shall enter the pavilions of Paradise. Therein shall ye possess whatsoever ye desire to own. And should ye remain veiled, ye shall surely die and return unto dust, and none shall help you. And when the matter is accomplished, that which was revealed in the Book whose verses were perfected by One All-Knowing, All-Wise - ye shall surely write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest an epistle sublime and exalted, and shall enjoin that it be delivered unto Him by one of the God-fearing. Perchance God may transform those who were veiled by proofs in the Book and may forgive them what they acquired on the Day of Resurrection in the Bayan. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the Generous. This is of God's bounty unto you, that ye may be God-fearing. And Our proof against those who followed not God's command is those who did follow and were assured in God's religion. And God will surely question the divines as He questioneth those who follow them, that perchance in the days of God they may not lead anyone away from God's path. Say: The potentiality of all things in the Book is what can appear after its formation. This is God's path in the Book. Ye go not the way the philosophers have gone, nor are ye veiled as the divines were veiled. Hold fast unto what hath been sent down from God, for this is God's path for all who are in the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. On the Day of Resurrection ye shall manifest what can appear from you in your being. Perchance ye may prepare yourselves for the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then according to what God hath created within your potential in the worlds of your being, ye shall appear before God. This is the reward of him who hath believed in God and His verses and was of the sincere ones. Unto God belongeth the splendor of the glorious glory of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Most Glorious, the All-Glorious, the Most High. Unto God belongeth the majesty of the majestic might of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Most Majestic, the All-Majestic, the Most High. Unto God belongeth the beauty of the beauteous grace of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Most Beautiful, the All-Beautiful, the Most High. Unto God belongeth the grandeur of the grand greatness of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is the Most Grand, the All-Grand, the Most High.

By God! Great, Most Great, and Supremely Great! And by God! Light of lights illumining the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, and God is the Light, the Illumined, the Illuminating! And by God! The Merciful, the Compassionate, the All-Merciful to all in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and God is the Compassionate, the Merciful, the All-Merciful! And by God! The Ancient, Most Ancient, Ancient of the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Ancient, the Pre-existent, the Eternal! And by God! The Perfect, Most Perfect, Perfect in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Perfect, the Complete, the All-Perfect! And by God! The Mighty, Most Mighty, Mighty in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Powerful! And by God! The Great, Most Great, Great in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Great, the Supreme, the Exalted! And by God! The Generous, Most Generous, Generous in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Generous, the Bountiful, the All-Bountiful! And by God! The All-Knowing, Most Knowing, Knowing in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Knowing, the Omniscient, the All-Knowing! And by God! The Powerful, Most Powerful, Powerful in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Powerful! And by God! The Well-Pleased, Most Pleased, Well-Pleased in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Pleased, the All-Pleased, the Ever-Pleased! And by God! The Beloved, Most Beloved, Beloved in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Beloved, the All-Beloved, the Ever-Loving! And by God! The Noble, Most Noble, Noble in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Noble, the All-Noble, the Ever-Noble! And by God! The Sovereign, Most Sovereign, Sovereign in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Sovereign, the All-Sovereign, the Ever-Sovereign! And by God! The King, Most Kingly, Kingly in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Kingly, the All-Kingly, the Ever-Kingly! And by God! The Exalted, Most Exalted, Exalted in the heavens and the earth and all between them, and God is the Most Exalted, the All-Exalted, the Ever-Exalted!Were all who dwell in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them to gather together to produce the like of these verses, they would assuredly fail and prove unable, even though they be the most eloquent among men.The Third Gate of the Eighth Unity concerning the knowledge of the Name "The Admonisher," which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Most Admonishing, the Most Admonishing. God! There is no God but He, the Most Admonishing, the Most Admonishing. Say: God is the Most Admonishing above every possessor of admonition. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can resist the sovereignty of His admonition. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Admonisher, the Warner, the All-Counseling.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, and the Glory and the Grandeur, and the Power and the Divinity, and the Might and the Splendor, and the Sovereignty and the Realm of Nature. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily, He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not. Not a thing in the heavens or in the earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape His grasp. He createth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Say: Verily, God doth admonish you to fear the Day when your good-pleasure shall be transformed into fire.

Say: God admonisheth you to fear the Day when your good-pleasure shall be turned into fire, while ye all together think that ye are in paradise, rejoicing. But God beareth witness, and they who are endowed with knowledge bear witness, and the angels bear witness, and those of lofty station bear witness, that ye have veiled yourselves from Him Who created you, and sustained you, and caused you to die, and quickened you, inasmuch as ye have veiled yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest. O people of the Bayan, fear ye in this!And deem not this a mere fancy, for all matters return unto this, if ye would but briefly remember. That is the Day when God shall make manifest the Manifestation of His Self with decisive proof. If ye believe in Him, then shall ye abide forever in paradise. But if ye veil yourselves from His presence, the essence of your light shall be turned to fire, your deeds shall come to naught, while ye counsel others from your seats, and that which We promised you shall come to pass, while ye lament and take no heed.And if ye be in doubt concerning this, behold those who came before you - how many servants were given the Gospel and admonished their learned ones about the appearance of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and they continue to this day in their admonitions. Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them, and one thousand two hundred and seventy years have passed, yet they continue in their admonitions, heedless. Similar are they who were given the Quran, and similar shall ye be on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Marvel not at this! But if ye would observe every matter revealed in the Bayan and reflect upon the proof of Him Who shall be made manifest, perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may hold fast to Him Whom God shall make manifest and His proof, and thus be saved.But there come to you in your night servants who desire to exalt themselves, and when We see no proof with them, they train you not to be certain of them. And on the Day of Resurrection, when He Whom God shall make manifest cometh to you with decisive proof, ye imagine therein other than the truth. But God hath taught you in the Bayan that the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest is not like the cause of anyone else. Can any besides God reveal a verse that would render all the worlds powerless? Say: Glory be to God! Who besides Him Whom God shall make manifest can by his nature recite the verses of his Lord? All are powerless to do this.Never could truth be confused with aught else, if ye would but reflect on His proof. Falsehood cannot be confused with truth, if ye would but reflect on the proof of truth. How many servants in Islam have claimed false causes which ye followed, even after witnessing proof! What then shall be your excuse before your Lord, if ye would but briefly reflect? Therefore watch over yourselves in your night, that ye grieve not anyone, whether ye find proof with him or not, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may not grieve Him in Whose grasp lieth all proof.If ye see no proof with anyone by himself, he will never be able to manifest the truth, and God shall suffice to deal with him. It behooveth you not to grieve any soul, for God shall surely question concerning him and shall judge him. Ye should hold fast to the proof of your religion, then act according to what hath been revealed in the Bayan. Your similitude is like one who buildeth a garden and planteth therein trees of every fruit. When its Owner cometh, ye will have possessed it in His name\[...\]

Your example is like one who builds a garden and plants therein trees of every fruit. When its owner comes, you have taken possession of it in his name, yet when he comes in his own person, you deny him. We planted the tree of the Qur'an and brought forth in that garden every fruit, which you all enjoy. When We come to possess what We have planted, it is as though you know not its owner. Grieve Us not, nor keep Us from what We ourselves have planted in that garden, for We are independent of what you possess, after which We shall not permit any among you even a mustard seed, and We shall indeed call all to account.We planted the garden of the Bayan in the name of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and permitted you to dwell therein until the time of His manifestation. From the first moment He is made manifest, We have forbidden unto you all that you possess except what you may use by His leave. Transgress not the bounds of your religion if you be truly religious. If it be within your power to render unto Him Whom God shall make manifest what you possess, then you were never truly religious if you fail to do so. And if this be beyond your power, God may accept from you, on the Day of His manifestation, your religious devotion and your worldly affairs. God is witness unto all things.This is a Book from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Inform those in the land of Ba and Dal who reckon themselves among the righteous in God's religion. Say: God will surely question those who are among the learned in that land, and will return unto them what was ordained for them, for had they believed in God and His signs, they would have been among the true believers. Since they veiled themselves, they were veiled from their Lord's path. God will judge with truth on the Day of Resurrection, and God is knowing of all things.O number of the Judge! We created you, sustained you, caused you to die and brought you to life from a beginning that has no beginning until this moment when We make Ourselves known to you through Our signs, that you might be among those who recognize. God has manifested your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi, yet you remained veiled from the presence of God. When you heard of God's manifestation and waited the span of saying "yea," God will question you: "How were you among the patient ones?" after We created you for this and made you among the knowers. If you have heard a verse or seen one, Our proof has been completed against you, just as it was completed in the Qur'an. None other than God can reveal a verse. Perchance those who were given the Qur'an, when they hear God's verses, may remember them and attain certitude. We were patient with them for one thousand two hundred and seventy years, and showed them their own powerlessness and that of all creation, that they might be educated by how We educated them, and when they hear God's verses from His Proof in this time, they might believe and be convinced. And if you have neither heard a verse nor seen one, God your Lord will question you, after you have heard a wondrous and new Cause, that you might testify to His proof and be among the guided ones.

Thou shalt be of those who are guided. If God had commanded thee to make a pilgrimage as part of thy religion aforetime, how canst thou depart from thy home if thou findest a way thereto, while that which upholdeth thy entire religion - if thou remainest veiled from it - shall deprive thee of all that thou possessest, as though thou hadst never been among those who act? Thou hearest and art patient until the Day of Resurrection passeth, while thou art among the slumberers. Thou hast been honored through Our names, yet when We have made known to thee that which returneth from thee unto Us, thou sayest 'yea' to all that thou hast possessed through Our names, thinking thou art among the sincere ones. Thou hast worshipped God, thy Lord, throughout thy life and wert among those who prostrate themselves. Had thou said 'yea' when thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, it would have been better for thee than all thy worship of God, thy Lord, even hadst thou been among the sincere ones. For perchance through thy faith the Cause of thy Lord would have been exalted at the time of His appearance, but through thy worship of God, thy Lord, naught returneth unto Us, even wert thou among the most pious of the pious. Consider thou the third verse of the Surih of Thunder, that thou mayest be among those who remember. Thou wert created to attain the presence of thy Lord - how then canst thou be among the veiled ones? There is no doubt that God cannot be comprehended by anything in the heavens or on earth or between them, for He comprehendeth all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the Subtle One. What God hath intended by meeting Him is the meeting with what is revealed unto Him of His verses, and He hath made this His proof unto all the worlds. If thou hadst remembered when We were revealing the verses of God, God would have transformed thy negation into affirmation, for He is the Bestower, the Generous One. But if thou remainest veiled after the matter hath been decreed, thou shalt find no way unto that. And if thou rememberest thereafter and desirest to be among the saved ones, then be thou content with anyone on thy land who hath believed in the proof of thy Lord, even if he be among those who sell figs and possess not even the husk of a date-stone, for therein lieth the source of Our good-pleasure from which all derive sustenance. Write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and counsel that should any of the God-fearing deliver it unto Him, that it be spread before God, that perchance God may transform the fire into light and pardon thee in the Book for what God hath witnessed against thee in the Bayan. Verily He was, in the second in the second, forgiving, pardoning, generous.In the Name of God, the Most Tremendous, the Most Tremendous!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Unto Thee belong all beauty and its essence, all glory and its essence, all grace and its essence, all grandeur and its essence, all light and its essence, all mercy and its essence, all perfection and its essence, all completion and its essence, all greatness and its essence, all might and its essence, all knowledge and its essence, all power and its essence, all good-pleasure and its essence, all love and its essence, all honor and its essence, all sovereignty and its essence, all loftiness and its essence, all bounty and its essence, and whatsoever Thou hast fashioned in the kingdom of Thy command and creation. Thou hast ever been what Thou wert before all things, and shalt ever be what Thou art after all things.

I am That One Who, beyond all things, exists; above all things, subsists; and beneath all things, persists. From time immemorial Thou hast been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Living, All-Compelling, Sovereign, All-Subduing, Holy, Everlasting, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Inaccessible, Exalted, All-Powerful, All-Possessing. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hadst Thou any partner in what Thou didst create, nor any protector in what Thou didst fashion. Thou dost ever cause to live and to die, then to die and to live, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Potentate Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth not a thing, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.The Third, in the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great, the Third. Praise be to God, the Dawning, the Gleaming, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the True, the Precise, the Liberating, the Foremost, the Exalted, the Unifying - praise that filleth the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them with the resplendent lights of His countenance and the radiant beams of His face. I testify, and all creation with me, that there is none other God but He, the One, the All-Compelling.He hath chosen an impregnable Essence, a radiant Abstraction, an exalted Purity, a manifest Camphor, and a beloved Embroidery. Then He revealed Himself to it through it, and through it became inaccessible from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Then appeared from it what was in it and upon it, and thereby were filled the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but He, and verily the Seven-Lettered Being is His servant and His Word.God hath chosen for Him primary, ornamental names, then immersed them in the shoreless ocean of primal eternity, whereby existence was filled, from the kingdom of the unseen to the realm of the visible, that there is no God but He, the Supreme, the Fourth in the Fourth, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Great, the Most Great. Praise be to God, beside Whom there is no other God, the Most Great, the Most Great.The splendor from God be upon the First One, and upon whomsoever resembleth that First One, wherein naught is seen save the First One.I testify that there is no admonisher save God, exalted be His glory, and no attractor save Him, mighty be His might. If thou admonishest in furtherance of the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily thy very essence proclaimeth that Most Glorious Name and Most Exalted Symbol. Therefore, thou shalt admonish every Friday from a pulpit concerning the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and thou shalt curse whoso heareth of His appearance yet believeth not in Him, and thou shalt bless whoso heareth of His appearance and then believeth in Him. Watch over thyself lest thou be veiled, and proclaim unto thyself and those who hear thee and come unto thee that divine commands shall appear, though thou wert heedless thereof.Watch over thyself insofar as thou art able, for the Day of Resurrection is indeed a mighty day. All seek God and His good-pleasure, yet God knoweth each soul and its pleasure through Him Whom God shall make manifest and His good-pleasure. People are like animals - they toil to attain unto God and His good-pleasure, yet follow not Him Whom God shall make manifest to attain unto God and His good-pleasure. They exhaust their beings and their deeds while supposing within themselves that they are sincere in their religion.

They imagine themselves sincere in their religion, yet they remain veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest. The fourth gate of the twenty-eighth Unity concerning knowledge of the name Al-Muhaimin, which has four degrees. The first in the first:In the Name of God, the Most Authoritative, the Most AuthoritativeGod, there is no God but He, the Most Authoritative, the Most Authoritative. Say: God is above all those possessed of authority. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can escape from the dominion of His authority. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Authoritative, the All-Compelling, the All-Subduing.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lies between them. Say: All bow down before Him.Praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on earth and what lies between them stand in devotion. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Reality, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not - a King Whose sovereignty declineth not, a Justice that oppresseth not, an Authority that changeth not, and a Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will surely arrange your affairs in your first life and your next, if ye believe in and are certain of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Say: If ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and He removes from you any matter, then how shall ye not be in joy and delight until the Day of Resurrection, if ye would but reflect a little and then give thanks. And if any one of you should become veiled, perhaps the Most Exalted Cause would become difficult for all of you together, and none on earth could remain veiled from His decree if he desired, between himself and his Lord, to be numbered among the believers.Therefore reflect how through the veiling of any one of you the Cause becomes difficult for all who are on earth, if ye would but reflect a little. And through the assistance of any one of you, how God makes the Cause easy for all who are on earth, if ye would but reflect a little. Consider then your affairs, for all this is established by the word of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if ye would but reflect a little.If ye wish to understand the glory of His command or prohibition, then observe from the time when pilgrimage to the House was made obligatory upon people until now, how many souls on earth have reached it after having become capable, though every soul on earth should reach it, and how many servants from that day until now have toiled on the path to the House and spent their wealth \[...\]

How many servants, from that day to this day, toil in the path of the House and expend their wealth. And when Muhammad said "No," consider how great is that blessing where none upon the earth need weary themselves to journey to the House, nor spend even a mustard seed of what God hath bestowed upon them in its path. This is according to your measure, as ye are able to comprehend, else if God were to create, after all things, the like of what is on earth, it would benefit them only as much as benefiteth you from what ye witness in the path of the House. But ye understand not the essence of the matter from God, nor wisdom, and act like animals without perceiving. Throughout your lives ye toil to possess a small thing, yet on the Day of Resurrection ye believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, that He might establish the Cause over all the earth through your faith, nor doth it weigh heavily upon them or upon you in your veiling, and ye imagine that ye are possessed of understanding.Nay, by God! Ye have not been given understanding even to the extent of a mustard seed, else ye would believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest at the time of His appearance, and would not veil yourselves from God, your Lord, to any degree. And concerning that for which ye toil and labor, ye shall possess nothing at the time of God's manifestation by the word "No." Your souls and deeds shall be brought to naught. Have ye understanding even to the extent of a mustard seed? All that ye have wrought from the beginning of that Manifestation to its end shall perish, and ye grow greater until the Day of Resurrection, imagining that ye are possessed of wisdom. This was before you and this shall be after you. And had those who were given the Gospel believed in Muhammad, the Messenger of God, God would testify that from the time the Gospel was revealed until it was raised up, they would have been raised up from disobedience. This was the reward before them - for five hundred years, all would have been mentioned in the spirit and sweet perfume from God.After they toil to perform good deeds, it returneth to their fathers and mothers, and they return to their fathers and mothers a word that is not from God, and they remember not, nor do they understand. This was the benefit of their veiling before the length of time. And afterward, had they believed, perhaps God would have made their Cause easy through Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and they would have profited in spirit and sweet perfume until the Day of Resurrection through the commands of their Lord, and they would have been exalted therein. This was the benefit of their beginning days and this the benefit of their returning days. Consider then: have they understanding even to the extent of a mustard seed? Though each one of them sayeth of himself, "I am Plato" in the elevation of their thoughts and the inaccessibility of their perception. This is what they imagine and this is what God hath testified concerning them.And ye, O people of the Bayan, be not like unto them, and remove not yourselves as they did, but watch over your souls on the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. For from the time God revealed the Bayan until the time of His manifestation, ye toil and strive and work that God, your Lord, might be pleased with you. But God will not be pleased with you unless Him Whom God shall make manifest is pleased, and should He say "No," all of you and your works shall perish, even as Muhammad said before.

Your works are like what Muhammad said before, and you believe in those who were given the Gospel. Such is the benefit of the Manifestation that came before you if you remain veiled, and in the Manifestation that comes after you God will not testify to your faith. How then will He judge you? And perchance there shall be revealed a Command that will prove difficult for you if you desire to save yourselves from God's fire after your death and enter into God's religion. And if judgment is passed concerning you, it shall remain for your descendants until the Day of Resurrection. Be not veiled from this, for if you remain veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, upon yourselves shall fall the lengthy Bayan and then from the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest until the Day of Resurrection, in your religion and your world. And while in your world you move according to your own selves for your religion, when God does not testify to your having any religion, then do you possess anything, even though you may count yourselves among the God-fearing?This is what God has counseled you. Be not veiled from saying "yea" at the appearance of the Truth, lest you deserve to say "nay" and bring to naught all that you have wrought, and make difficult for yourselves and your descendants until the Day of Resurrection the Cause of God, while you neither remember nor reflect. It is the same with God whether He commands or forbids - both depend on His saying "yea" or "nay." But when He sends down a command or prohibition, then it behooveth all who are on earth to observe it if they wish to enter into God's religion. Otherwise, God is independent of all that is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever is between them. All are poor before God, even if they claim adherence to His religion, for perchance in God's sight they may not be mentioned as having any religion, and after their death they shall not enter the fire.Look ye unceasingly to the cause of your deeds and what returns unto them, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may be saved. This is a Book from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved, the Best-Beloved. Announce unto those who dwell in the realm of Ha, for We are the Announcers. O thou! We have indeed created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We would make Ourself known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mayest be of them that recognize. We have made Ourself known unto thee through Our signs after there had elapsed from the revelation of the Qur'an by God the number of Gharis, that those who were given the Qur'an might remember through God's signs and be guided.Verily God will question thee concerning those who are in that land, for if thou hadst followed the Truth, then these would have been followers. Their reward shall return unto thee after God giveth them the reward of their deeds. Naught shall be diminished from them after there returneth unto thee what they possess of all things, for God hath power over all things. But since thou hast remained veiled, there shall return unto thee what God hath ordained concerning their veiling. Were the veil to be lifted, thou wouldst surely wish to prostrate thyself before God and wouldst bid those who followed thee to enter into God's religion. Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and wert among those who prostrated themselves before Us. But when We made Ourself known unto thee, thou didst not say "yea." How then can it profit thee that thou worshippest God by night \[...\]

If you have indeed recognized Us, how can your nocturnal and diurnal worship of God benefit you while you consider yourself among the God-fearing? Whatever God ordained for you in the Qur'an of deeds must be demonstrated on the Day of Resurrection before God, else not an iota shall profit you. How many prostrations have you performed throughout your life, boasting that you were among those who prostrate before God, yet you did not prostrate before God even once on the Day of His Manifestation, though We created all things in the Qur'an that they might believe in meeting Us. You recite the third verse of the Surah of Thunder to testify that those given the Qur'an have been veiled from that for which they were created, though they think they do well. Consider how you entered your religion and prostrated yourself before God, the Lord of all worlds. Was it not through seeing the Qur'an made clear from God as a proof to all worlds, though you saw neither prophet, imam, gate, nor any fresh sign that would confound all creation? You simply saw the Qur'an and were convinced it was a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Had you not witnessed your own powerlessness before it, you would not have been among the discerning in your religion. And had you not witnessed the inability of all on earth to produce its like, how could you be counted among those with insight before God, your Lord? If anything testifies to this, then judge fairly between yourself and God your Lord, if you be fair-minded. What difference is there between seeing the Qur'an and seeing the verses of the Bayan, if you be among the perceptive? By God, We have seen no difference, even as a mustard seed, for those endowed with knowledge who are discerning in their religion. Not so for those who look to creation, following truth by following others and becoming veiled by their veiling. These are like animals - what lies ahead does not guide those who walk behind. These are they who walk without using reason, neither reasoning within themselves nor seeing clearly. We sent down the Qur'an and were patient with those who believed in it for 1,270 years that they might remember on the Day of God's Manifestation - remember through their prior faith in it and then through this proof, believing. We revealed therein that none but God could send down a sign, that when they heard a sign they might demonstrate the faith they had shown before, then show it again and remember God's signs at His appearance, then believe. Each testifies within himself that he is a believer, but God has testified concerning them all that they do not truly testify about themselves, else they would testify to what God has testified. We have witnessed those who heard of God's Manifestation from their Lord's proof, which all were promised and for whose day of appearance they would supplicate night and day in earnest prayer - when they heard God's verses they did not say "yea" but departed from what they had entered into, and We were witnesses to the truth. Did you think We would not try you \[...\]

We were, in truth, witnesses to all things. Do ye imagine that We shall not try you when We have created you with the knowledge that ye shall return unto dust, and then unto Us shall ye be brought back? Or do ye glory in Our names while, when ye recognize Us, ye glory not in Us? Verily shall We put every people to the test of their Faith. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, We shall try them: if they bear witness to the truth from their Lord, We shall remember them with a goodly remembrance -- such is Our recompense to the God-fearing. We have naught else in God's kingdom; all possess according to what is ordained for them. And if We witness that they recognize not that which they worship, We shall not remember them with a true remembrance -- such is their fire from Us, and besides this, in the kingdom, they bear witness only unto themselves. And the Hour hath come to pass after they were all gathered, then dispersed, then presented, then raised up, then returned to that from which they were created by their Lord's command, and they remain to this time hearing and patient. And those who returned not had not within them the spirit of life whereby they might know God whom they worship night and day. They are, in God's sight, as dead, knowing neither their beginning nor their end, nor him upon whom God hath sent down the Book. They toil throughout their lives to attain somewhat of God's good-pleasure, imagining that God's good-pleasure appeareth through him whom God shall manifest. Whoso imagineth otherwise -- these are they who wander in the wilderness of their fancy, supposing they walk in the path of the unseen, while God hath made Himself known to them, yet they recognize Him not. Between them and the signs in their hearts which appeared through the manifestation of the Point of the Qur'an aforetime, they suppose they are exalted. O thou! Hadst God not revealed Himself unto thee through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, thou wouldst not have known God thy Lord, nor wouldst thou have been among those who recognize Him. This is a sign that hath been reflected from the Sun of Truth in the mirror of thine essence, and thou supposest between thyself and it that thou art among the sincere ones. Detach thyself from the sun of mirrors and recognize Him Who causeth them to shine forth, for He is the Most Manifest of the manifest ones. Verily, there is no God but I, the Single, the Inaccessible, the August. If ye worship God between yourselves and Him in your own selves, how is it that between yourselves and Us ye know Us not? And how do ye follow the conditions of your knowledge before Us? Nay, by God! We have witnessed naught in that creation save a vain fancy: they know not God Who manifesteth Himself to them, nor do they prostrate themselves before God, though they prostrate themselves before Our previous Manifestations. Yet it profiteth them not, since they know not Him before Whom they prostrate themselves, and at times they even pass judgment against Him, even as thou hast heard of those who passed judgment against Us while they were created through Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and worship and prostrate themselves before Us. Therefore, announce unto those possessed of knowledge in that land, that perchance they may have mercy upon themselves and deliver themselves from the fire. Otherwise, verily We are independent of all things, while all are in need of God in every condition, before every condition, and after every condition. If thou rememberest in the days of God and returnest unto God, thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, God will transform what He hath recorded in the Book into that which will please thy heart. Verily, He is the Best of forgivers.

And thou hast returned unto God, thy Lord, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Verily God shall change what hath been witnessed in the Book to that which shall gladden thy heart, for He is the Best of Forgivers. Otherwise what hath been revealed would not have been set forth in detail from the presence of the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. And when the matter was decreed, then thou didst remember God's grace and mercy, that all the worlds might attain thereunto. But the way of this is that thou shouldst cause those believers who dwell in thy land to be well-pleased with thee, even if it be but a woman in ruins possessing naught, for therein lieth the hiding-place of the manifestation of God, the Most High, the Most Great. God will verily aid all who dwell in that land from that source, but most men know not. And thou shalt write a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God, thy Lord, therein, and charge that it be delivered unto Him by one of the believers, that what thou hast written may be spread forth on the other Resurrection between the hands of God, the Inaccessible, the Exalted, even as it shall be spread between the hands of Him Whom God shall make manifest, possessed of exalted and sublime glory. May God transform the fire into light; verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Fifth Gate, the Forgiver, the Bountiful.From the Twenty-eighth UnityThe Twenty-eighth MonthOn the knowledge of the Name "The Destroyer," which hath four stations. First station:In the Name of God, the Most Destroying, the Most DestroyingSay: God is the Most Destroying, above every possessor of destruction. None in the heavens or the earth or whatsoever is between them can resist the sovereignty of His destroying power. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He is the Destroyer, the Destroying, the All-Destructive.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God, Whom glorifieth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Empire, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Celestial Domain, then the Sovereignty and the Human Kingdom. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or in the earth or in what lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall destroy as He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Glorified be He before Whom prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Announce unto him who is in the Land of Kaf, for verily We are the Announcer.O thou! Verily We have created thee \[...\]

This is a Book from God, the Overseer, the Self-Subsisting, to the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce unto him who is in the Land of Kaf, for verily We are the Announcers.O thou! We have created thee and provided for thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, that We might make known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mayest be of those who recognize.Verily God will question thee concerning all who are on earth, and unto thee shall return what hath been ordained for them. God is witness over all things. Thou hast worshipped God, thy Lord, throughout thy life and wert among those who prostrate themselves. When We made Our Self known unto thee, the tree of thy faith bore no fruit save the word "yea" which returneth unto Us on the Day of Our Manifestation, though thou wert in the realm of the unseen among the believers.Had thou said "yea," it would have been better for thee than all the worship thou hast rendered unto God, thy Lord, throughout thy life, even though thou didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing. We had sent down the Furqan aforetime and We waited one thousand two hundred and seventy years for those who were given the Book, that they might remember the proof of their religion and thereby be convinced.We revealed therein that none but God is able to send down a single verse, that perchance those who were given the Furqan might, when they hear of the appearance of God, remember the signs of God through His proof and then be convinced. God hath manifested your Qa'im, your Guide, and your Mahdi, as ye were promised aforetime.Throughout your lives ye supplicated and implored for His appearance, yet when God's messengers came unto you with clear proofs and guidance, ye remembered naught and supposed that in your patience ye would find salvation.Say: Glory be to God above what those who remember Him remember! Exalted be God above what the speakers speak, with great exaltation! Look thou at the third verse of the Surah of Thunder, for thou wert among those who were certain of it.God created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them that those who were given the Furqan might believe in the meeting with their Lord and be convinced. God created no soul except for the day of meeting with its Lord, but people are veiled from that for which they were created.God is independent of all that is in the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them, while all are poor before God, worshipping God their Lord by night and day, prostrating themselves before Him.We have made thee and thy deeds as the day thou wert created and hadst done no deeds. Verily, just as Our proof was completed against thee in the Book, so hath Our proof been completed against thee in the Bayan - all from God and all believe in Him.We have sent Messengers from a beginning that hath no beginning, saying: "Worship none but God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth and whatsoever is between them." We found thee not believing in any one of them, though thou didst reckon thyself a believer in them. But God beareth witness against thee in the Book with truth, and hadst thou not been veiled from the Primal Point, thou wouldst have been among the believers in all the Messengers together.

Had you not been veiled from the Primal Point, you would assuredly have been numbered among the believers in all the Messengers. We have sent down all the Books that you might speak naught but the truth concerning God. Yet We found you not to be among those who believe in what God hath revealed in the Books. If you have believed in the Bayan and have not spoken aught but the truth regarding the Primal Point, then verily you have believed in all that God hath revealed in every Book and are numbered among those who believe in what God hath willed therein. But since you are veiled, your previous belief will profit you not, and We are indeed the Reckoners.Since all religions return to the Messengers and the Books, We desired not to reckon you by them. Therefore take heed of how We have reckoned you in regard to the Messengers, Books, and all religions, if you be of those who perceive. Say: God would be ashamed to reveal words devoid of truth. Therefore, O servants of God, be ye ashamed to speak aught but truth, and be ye among those who are assured of the signs of God.If you wish to meet with anyone, meet with them according to what they possess, if ye be truthful. Otherwise be ashamed, for God hath forbidden you to dispute with anyone except according to what they possess. This is what God revealed in all previous Books and thereafter in the Bayan, and We are indeed cognizant of all things.You have prided yourself on understanding the words of one who believed in God and His signs and was numbered among the believers. If you knew God your Lord as He Who, there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, then you would know God your Lord as He Who, there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. But you have not grasped from the essence of knowledge and wisdom what would profit you even to the extent of a date-stone. You shall die and return to dust, and shall not be remembered before God.If you remember in the days of God and desire to save yourself and those who follow you - God is indeed Forgiving, Merciful. If you are patient, there shall return to you from God that which you fear, and God is indeed Self-Sufficient, Inaccessible, Exalted. If you remember after the matter is decreed, God hath opened a way for you and for those who wish to save themselves. Therefore, guard those who have believed in God in your land, if you desire to be among the saved ones. For from there doth God assist all who are in that land, if you be of those who are endowed with insight.Moreover, write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and arrange that it be delivered to Him by one of the sincere ones. Perchance God will transform the negative into the positive through His grace, for He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.Verily those who are given knowledge understand not the interpretation of what God hath revealed in the verses - how then can those beneath them hope to understand? Though you have prided yourself on your belief in them all, they have returned to the first life and have been created in the latter creation just as they were created in the first creation, and We are indeed powerful over all things - He Who createth by His word those who were witnesses before.

Verily, We have power over all things. By His word He createth those who are His witnesses before all the worlds, both past and future. Be not veiled from His word, clinging to the words of those who pride themselves in having comprehended their words before, though they were but among the believers. Let not this perturb you, for those who were given the Gospel, had they found words from the witnesses of Jesus rather than from those who followed His witnesses, would have believed and acted upon them. Yet when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them with guidance and clear proofs, they veiled themselves from God their Lord, held fast to what they possessed, and imagined themselves to be pious in their religion. And those who were given the Bayan are similarly afflicted. Therefore, have mercy upon yourselves and believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, that ye may be saved. Say: That which God revealed aforetime to Muhammad, the Messenger of God, over twenty-three years - in which ye all believe and are certain - God can reveal to His Proof, if He willeth, in but three days and nights, for verily He is the Ordainer, the Powerful, the Mighty. Indeed, God's Cause through His Proof is more wondrous than what God revealed through Muhammad, the Messenger of God, aforetime, would ye but reflect a little. God hath manifested His Proof from among those who could not speak in the tongue of the Arabs, and after twenty-four years of his life did God make him manifest, whereas aforetime it was after forty years, when God had nurtured him among those who spoke in the Arabic tongue. Verily, We sent unto thee one in whose knowledge thou didst take pride, then guided him when We returned him to the life to come, though thou wert not among those who were guided. Thus doth God, thy Lord, try thee, for verily He is All-Knowing, All-Wise. We have sent down unto thee the Book which, had We sent it down upon a mountain, it would surely have prostrated itself before God and would have been among the guided. This is greater than that which thou wert certain of before, for this uplifteth that and establisheth itself. Were it not greater in God's sight, how could it abrogate what was decreed before and establish itself as a Cause from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting? Yet thou hast not remembered it, though hadst thou held fast unto it, it would have been better for thee than all wherewith thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life, even hadst thou been among those who prostrate themselves. Behold how We have tried those who were given the Furqan - had God shown them a new sign, perchance some would have held fast to it and been guided. Yet God hath sent down greater than these, like unto what He had shown them before in the Furqan, in which they believe. Were the verses of the Furqan not greater than what God had revealed unto the Prophets of new signs, how could God abrogate thereby what was revealed and establish thereby the religion of Muhammad, the Messenger of God? Yet most people remember not the proof of their religion, nor do they reason thereby. Say: God is more bountiful than any possessor of bounty; none in the heavens can withhold themselves from the dominion of His bounty \[...\]

Say: God is more munificent than all who show munificence. None in the heavens or on earth or between them can withhold himself from the dominion of His munificence. Verily, He has been and ever will be the All-Bountiful, the Eternal, the Most Generous.In the Name of God, the Most Just, the Most Just! Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee. Unto Thee belong all glory and grandeur, all majesty and might, all radiance and splendor, all beauty and perfection, all light and illumination, all mercy and compassion, all completion and fulfillment, all greatness and excellence, all power and authority, all knowledge and wisdom, all might and strength, all love and affection, all honor and nobility, all sovereignty and dominion, all kingship and rule, all exaltation and transcendence, all eternality and everlastingness. Unto Thee belong whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been before all things, and after all things, and with all things, and the Creator of all things. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Self-Subsisting, Ever-Living, All-Compelling, Sovereign, All-Subduing, Holy, Everlasting, Most Exalted, Inaccessible, Most High. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son. Thou givest life and causeth death, then causeth death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the King Who changeth not, the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art, in the third degree, powerful over all things.In the Name of God, the Most Just, the Most Just! Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His transcendence above all created things, Who hath raised Himself in His elevation above all atoms, Who hath manifested His power above all beings, and His sovereignty above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. All His creation beareth witness that there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Just. He hath chosen a supreme Essence, a radiant Abstraction, an exalted Purity, a majestic Crystal, a mighty Pattern, then revealed Himself to it through it while remaining inaccessible from it, and cast upon its reality the image of itself. Then there appeared from it what was within and upon it, filling thereby the heavens and earth and what lieth between them, testifying that there is no God but Him and that the Seven-Lettered Name is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen for Him primary essential names, then immersed them in the limitless ocean of eternity, whereupon existence was filled from the imperceptible realm of mystery to the visible kingdom of testimony, attesting that there is no God but Him, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting.In the Name of God, the Most Just, the Most Just! Praise be to God, there is no God but Him, the One, the Most Just, the Most Just. All glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon whomsoever resembleth that Unity wherein naught is seen save the Primal Unity. Furthermore, I testify that none is more just than God, exalted be His glory, and none causeth justice save Him, mighty be His power. If thou manifesteth this in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest to one who believeth not in Him, then verily the mirror of thine essence reflecteth the action of thy Lord's sun \[...\]

In the name of God, the Most Understanding, the All-Understanding. God - there is no God but Him, the Most Understanding, the All-Understanding.Say: God is more understanding than all who possess understanding. None in the heavens or on earth or in between them can escape from the sovereignty of His understanding. He creates whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the All-Comprehending, the Most Understanding, the Wise.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom bow down in worship all who are in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Glory and the Grandeur, the Power and the Divinity, the Might and the Sovereignty of all things. He giveth life and causeth death; then He causeth death and giveth life. He, verily, is the Living One Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will cause you to understand the proof of Truth at the time of its manifestation, if ye believe in what God causeth you to understand and act accordingly. God hath created nothing more mighty than this, if ye would be guided by what God bestoweth upon you.Say: God hath specially favored those who are endowed with knowledge in the Book of God, and those who ponder upon their beginning and their end, that they may return unto God their Lord and not squander the fruits of their own selves.Say: Whoso believeth in Him Whom God shall make manifest, these are they who are endowed with understanding in the Book of God, and these are they who comprehend, whether they have knowledge of things or not, for what profiteth from understanding \[...\]

Those are they who understand, whether they know anything or not, for the fruit of understanding and comprehension in the Book of God is that the servant should know God and act according to His good-pleasure. You cannot know God and His good-pleasure except by knowing Him Whom God shall make manifest and His good-pleasure. This is the primordial mystery for all the worlds. Whoso believeth not in Him Whom God shall make manifest - even though he be considered the most learned among men, whether by himself or by others - God doth not testify that he understands anything whatsoever. God hath not created understanding except for comprehending the Cause of Him Whom God shall make manifest and being numbered among the believers. Do you not observe those who were given the Books before you? They had no understanding, though they were considered by themselves and their people to be among those possessed of the highest understanding and comprehension. Yet God did not testify that they understood anything. Had they understood, they would have entered into the Faith of God and acted according to His good-pleasure.Fear God, lest ye squander what God hath given you of the essence of understanding and comprehension, that ye may direct it towards the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do not withhold from Him Whom God hath created as the Manifestation of His Self, and be not of those who claim to understand their own affairs while professing "We did not understand." God loveth not this in your worldly life, much less in your religion, if ye would but reflect a little.Say: The well-mannered ones in the Bayan, in their religion and their worldly affairs, are those who, when they understand something, do not manifest less than their understanding, and they are certain that what they have understood accords with God's good-pleasure. But if they witness aught contrary to their Lord's good-pleasure, then if they conceal their understanding and knowledge, God will grant them the reward of one who understands and knows, and is among the doers of good. God hath verily forbidden you, with a true prohibition, that when ye understand something, ye should manifest less than that understanding, whether it be concerning the ordinances of your religion or your worldly affairs, your return or your abode, that ye may be saved on the Day of Resurrection after God hath given you understanding. And after ye understand something different from what ye had understood, manifest it not.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Unto him who is mentioned by the name of Christ in the Book, for We are ever mindful: O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from the beginning that hath no beginning until now, that We might make Ourselves known to thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize. When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God and didst not say "Yea," thou didst veil thyself from that for which thou wast created and became of those who are far removed from God's path. When thou didst hear a verse or witness one, Our proof was completed against thee, even as Our proof was completed against thee in the Qur'an, and We are witness over all things. We created thee for the day of meeting with Us, yet when We made Ourselves known to thee, thou didst not present thyself before God, thy Lord, though thou wert among those who prostrated themselves before God, thy Lord, throughout thy life.

When We discovered thee, thou hadst not presented thyself before God, thy Lord, though thou wert among those who prostrated themselves. Throughout thy life thou didst worship God, thy Lord, and deemed thyself to be among the diligent. Yet thou didst veil thyself from the Manifestation of God after having heard, and naught of what thou hast acquired shall profit thee unless thou returnest unto God, the Most High, the Most Great.Consider the extent of thy knowledge: thou didst ascend to the House in accordance with what was revealed in the Qur'an, desiring to follow God's good-pleasure therein and to be among the sincere ones. Yet when the Lord of the House made Himself known to thee, and there was revealed in the Book what was previously revealed in the Qur'an, thou didst not present thyself before Him to be among those who prostrate themselves.Naught didst thou comprehend from thy pilgrimage after having veiled thyself from Him Who created the House and made it a sign unto all worlds. O thou one! God hath revealed no pathway in any religion except for the exaltation of Him Who would come in the next Manifestation, yet the people remain veiled from what God hath intended. God revealed nothing in the Qur'an except for the exaltation of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, in the beginning, that this might return to Muhammad in the end, and that they might appear before Him in the end even as they appeared in their first life. Otherwise their deeds profit them not, whether they appear in the unseen but fail to appear on the Day of God's Manifestation, or appear on the Day of God's Manifestation but fail to appear in the unseen. This was created for this - O every soul! Watch thou over both, even as We created, if thou desirest to be among those who are saved.Whoso pledgeth allegiance to the Messenger pledgeth allegiance to God his Lord - the hand of God is above all hands. O all things! By this shall ye be exalted on the Day of Resurrection in the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Yet thou, in the end of the unseen, didst make thyself one who denied the inner of the inner without right or illuminating Book, in that thou didst not follow Ahmad, the Manifestation of the inner, nor him who would inherit after him as the Manifestation of the inner of the inner. Thou didst judge between them in a way God hath not permitted any soul to judge another soul, thinking thyself to be among the God-fearing ones.Behold! Thou hast passed judgment on the first and second Islam, and hast judged what God would be ashamed to mention regarding the inner and the inner of the inner. Thou hast not belied thyself in God's religion concerning thy Lord's bounds, though thou didst reckon thyself among the diligent ones. God will surely return the fire of those who follow thee unto thee, except such as return unto God their Lord and seek forgiveness.If thou desirest to be among those who are saved on the Day of Resurrection, then return unto God thy Lord, for verily We are ever-forgiving. And if the matter be decreed from God, the Most High, the Most Great, and thou rememberest thereafter and desirest to be among those who are saved, then thou must satisfy the people of guidance who dwell in thy land, for this is thy Lord's good-pleasure in the Book and among all worlds.And thou must write a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and must enjoin that one of the believers deliver it unto Him. Perchance God will transform negation into affirmation.

Thou shalt verily counsel, should any of the believers reach His presence, perchance God may transform denial into affirmation and pardon thee and those who follow thee. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the Merciful.Say: He is independent of all that is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and self-sufficient above all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation and whatsoever lieth betwixt. All are His servants who glorify Him by night and by day, and who prostrate before Him in the watches of the night and at the two ends of the day. And all are His worshippers.In the Name of God, the Most Comprehending, the Most Comprehending!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone, alone, no partner hast Thou. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm, then the Glory and the Majesty, then the Countenance and the Beauty, then the Face and the Perfection, then the Likeness and the Similitudes, then the Stations and the Reverence, then the Grandeur and the Independence, then the Pride and the Revelation, then the Strength and the Deeds, then the Mercy and the Grace, then the Dominion and the Justice, then the Might and the Impregnability, then the Power and the Exaltation, then the Joy and the Gladness, then the Sovereignty and the Omnipotence, then whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love of the kingdom of Thy Command and Creation.Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, enduring after all things, creating all things, and abiding after all things. Sanctified are all Thy names and exalted are Thy examples in all that they contain and all that is upon them. Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Individual, Ever-living, Self-subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Transcendent, Impregnable, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hast Thou had any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Thou hast created all things by Thy power and ordained them by Thine ordinance. Thou hast formed all things by Thy will and fashioned them according to Thy forming.Therefore, O my God, preserve the people of the Bayan, from their first to their last, their outward and their inward aspects, lest they differ therein, and lest there occur to the heart of any one of them that which is unseemly, and how much more that it should appear from any one of them. May all follow a single path until the Day of Him Whom Thou shalt make manifest. On that Day, whomsoever Thou guidest to believe in Him, such a one is of the affirmation of the Bayan, and whomsoever Thou willest to cast into the fire through his own veiling of himself, such a one is of the negation of the Bayan.And before that, O my God, preserve all Thy servants in the Bayan, for after their differences there appear among them conditions unbefitting love, and this continueth until the Day of Resurrection and the Day of Thy Manifestation, when they are veiled from meeting Thee by false conditions which have arisen in the Bayan without Thy leave. And verily the harm of this in Thy sight is greater than its benefit in the veiling of the night.Therefore, O my God, hold fast the people of the Bayan by Thy power, and guide them all, O my God, by Thy guidance on the day of the appearance of Thy Proof, for verily nothing of Thy knowledge can be known, and nothing in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them can frustrate Thee. Thou givest life and causest death, then causest death and givest life, and verily Thou art the Ever-living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on the earth or what lieth between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy Command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.In the Name of God, the Most Comprehending, the Most Comprehending, the Third!Praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings \[...\]

Praise be to God Who hath in His transcendent majesty risen above all created things, Who hath in His exalted sovereignty ascended above all existing things, Who hath in His inaccessible might risen above all beings, Who hath in His power risen above all atoms, and Who hath in His dominion risen above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. His creation beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing.He hath chosen an impregnable Essence, a holy and pure Abstraction, a radiant and pristine Reality, an exalted and crystalline Being, and a beauteous Form. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, while remaining inaccessible to it, and cast into its reality the likeness of itself. Thus did there appear from it what was within and upon it, filling thereby the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but Him and that the Being of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen him for Himself and chosen for him primary and essential names, then immersed them in the boundless ocean of pre-existence. Thus was existence filled from the kingdom of the unseen and the dominion of the visible, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, the Single, the All-Sufficing, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Most Comprehending, the All-Understanding. The glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that none comprehendeth save God, exalted be His glory, and none perceiveth save Him, mighty be His power. If thou hast caused anyone to understand the evidences of Him Whom God shall make manifest and the paths of truth, then verily thy reality beareth tidings of that Most Exalted Name and Most Resplendent Sign. Otherwise, thou must truly understand that God hath not given thee comprehension and perception save for the exaltation of the mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest, the might of His Word, the elevation of His praise, the glory of His majesty, the grandeur of His glory, and whatsoever beseemeth the Sun of Truth from God, its Creator.Be thou possessed of understanding and perception in thy youth and age, thy beginning and end, thy outward and inward being, for God hath created naught more precious than understanding and perception when thou employest them in the good-pleasure of Him Whom God shall make manifest, which is identical with God's good-pleasure in the kingdom of creation and invention. If thou believest in Him, then thou art truly among those endowed with understanding; otherwise thou possessest not an atom of comprehension, though it was given thee that thou mightest know God thy Lord, attain unto His good-pleasure, deliver thyself from the fire after thy death, enter into the paradise of thy Lord's good-pleasure, and attain success with those who succeed at all times, before and after \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom boweth down in worship whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All submit themselves to His bidding.All praise be to God, Whom all things in the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them glorify. Say: All are devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Glory and the Grandeur, the Power and the Divinity, the Might and the Sovereignty. He giveth life and causeth death; then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Whose sovereignty perisheth not, the Just Who deviateth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the One Who suffereth no decline. Within His grasp are all things in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed be He Who holdeth sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God verily shapeth you in the wombs as He willeth, by His decree. There is none other God but I, the Supreme, the Most High. He it is Who ordaineth the measure of all things by His command. There is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.Say: God verily promiseth you that He will establish you in Paradise if ye believe in Him Who will be made manifest and are assured thereof. If ye fulfill God's Covenant regarding His Manifestation, God will surely fulfill His Covenant and will cause you to dwell in the highest chambers of Paradise, a bounty from His presence. Verily there is no God but Him, the Bountiful, the Most Generous.Say: All originate from God by His command, and all return unto God by His command.Say: The Cause lieth in the Primal Will in its mystery, of which ye knew not nor could comprehend before it was uttered. This is from My most pure, transcendent, immaculate, and excellent essence which God manifesteth as He willeth through the tongue of His Proof. Verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Most High.Is there any god besides God who could establish you in the stations that ye desire? And is there any god besides God who could raise you to the stations that ye love? Say: Glory be to God! All stand firm by His command. He it is Who ordaineth the measure of all things in the Book. There is no God but Him, the Most High, the Most Exalted.This is a Book from God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Make mention of him who is mentioned by the letters Jim and Ra in the Book, for We are ever mindful.O thou! We have verily created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment that We might make Ourselves known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize. We have made Ourselves known unto thee through clear signs before which the learned stand powerless, and through Messengers who announce tidings from God their Lord and who are truthful in their missions. Thou didst not truly know God thy Lord though thou wert among His worshippers throughout thy life.

And they in their messages are truthful. Thou hast not yet recognized God, thy Lord, though throughout thy whole life thou wert among the worshippers. Thou didst not prostrate thyself before God in the presence of the Messenger, though thou wert among those who prostrated before Us. We created all things for the Day of Our meeting, yet thou hast not understood that for which thou wert created, even after We appeared manifest above the earth. This is the extent of thy comprehension of the essence of that for which thou wert created, since thou art veiled by that which profiteth thee not from the secret of a mighty Balance. If thou hadst said "yea," it would have been better for thee than all that thou hast done in thy life, for thou wert among the diligent in thy knowledge and among the sincere in thy deeds. But when thou didst hear and didst not say "yea," affirmation was changed to denial, and We were indeed reckoning. This is an exalted, lofty, and elevated proof. For thou didst recognize in thy religion a proof from before, and no one cometh to remind thee except that it was none other than Us. And were this possible in another, he would surely remind thee and call thee to himself even as Muhammad called all unto God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. For other than the Sun cannot claim to be the Sun, and all mirrors are powerless to speak of themselves. Thus when thou didst hear, We established Our proof against thee in the very thing We caused thee to hear. And had We not established for thee the Cause of God with clear signs before which the learned are powerless, thus would God establish the truth through the proof of wisdom, a command from His presence - verily there is no God but I, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. By this doth God draw inference through those who were given the Book when God sent down the Furqan (Qur'an) upon Muhammad, the Messenger of God. Great indeed was God's proof against them thereby, yet they comprehend not. For everyone who came in their religion followed the path of their Messenger, except Muhammad, the Messenger of God. When He came, He manifested the path of His Lord and made known to all the world: "Verily, I am all the Messengers before and after, and that which God hath sent down in all the Books before and after, and verily I am the Book, All-Protecting, Well-Beloved." This is a proof in the essence of wisdom if thou art given the essence of knowledge, that thou mayest be among those who draw proper conclusions. Otherwise, consider the verses, for all are powerless before them. Just as We established Our proof against thee in the Furqan through the Book itself, We have established Our proof against thee in the Bayan through the verses themselves, a revelation from God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Thou didst worship God, thy Lord, in thy life and wert among those who prostrated before Us. Yet the tree of thy faith did not yield fruit for Us to the extent of saying "yea," though throughout thy whole life thou didst strive to attain somewhat of God's good pleasure and to be among those who would be saved thereby. O thou! All the affairs of religion were created only for the exaltation of Him upon Whom the Book is sent down. Be not veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest by the affairs of your religion. For religion is that whereby His Word is exalted, not that to which ye hold fast.

O this one! Know that all religious observances were created solely for the exaltation of Him upon Whom the Book shall descend. Let not your religious practices become a veil between you and Him Whom God shall make manifest. For religion is that whereby His Word is uplifted, not that to which you cling. And that to which you cling was created for the exaltation of what was revealed before, yet you remain veiled from the mystery of the Cause. Watch for the exaltation of the mention of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for that is your religion in the Bayan, if you be of those who testify to the truth on the day of His manifestation. There is no God but God, and you shall find no Manifestation of His Self other than Him Whom God shall make manifest, save after a Resurrection which God shall bring about to recompense all who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. For those who believe in the Manifestation of God are they who have believed in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and these are the God-fearing. And those who are veiled from belief in God their Lord are they who believe not in Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor in what is revealed to Him. God hath seized them for becoming veiled from Him Whom they worship night and day, while in all matters they claim to follow His command.O this one! God will question thee concerning those who followed thee in thy religion, and will return unto thee what was ordained for them. Therefore return unto God and deliver these souls from their fire, for We are indeed the Deliverer. God saith: O ye people! How do ye follow one who followeth not God, your Lord, while supposing that ye shall be saved thereby? O this one! How hast thou veiled thyself and these people from thy Lord's path while deeming thyself among the sincere ones? Watch over thyself that thou grievest no soul while thou livest, for We have witnessed that in the latter part of the night thou didst pass judgment on one who taught the people the inner knowledge and the innermost knowledge, whereas hadst thou sought knowledge from them, thou wouldst have been saved on the Day of Resurrection, if thou hadst acted upon what thou hadst learned with insight.How many servants sought knowledge from these two, yet their knowledge profited them not even to the extent of a date-stone! What thou hast learned is like a thousand mithqals of green earth whose value equals but five dirhams of silver. Thus doth God show thee the worth of thy knowledge, that the people of the Bayan may be among those who remember. For knowledge is only that which bringeth thee unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and causeth thee to prostrate before Him. Apart from this, no knowledge existeth in God's sight nor in any mighty Book.If thou wouldst remember and return unto God, thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Manifest, the Subduer, the Glorious - perchance God will transform the fire into light. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Gracious. And if thou waitest until the matter is accomplished, what verses have been sent down have been detailed from the presence of the All-Knowing, the Inaccessible, the Mighty.Thou shalt find no way unto this save that thou shouldst satisfy on thine own behalf those who have believed in God, the Most High, the Supreme, the Great, and that thou shouldst write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest an elevated and noble letter. And thou shouldst seek God's forgiveness therein and be among the penitent. Perchance God will transform the negative into the positive by His leave. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the Forgiver. He is the One Whose forgiveness knoweth no diminution in the kingdom of the heavens\[...\]

Be ye among the repentant ones. May God transmute adversity into affirmation through His grace. Verily, He hath ever been the All-Forgiving, the Forgiver, the Most Generous. He is the One Whose forgiveness in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them knoweth no diminution, and naught but the withholding of forgiveness in the kingdoms of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is between them grieveth Him. He doeth what He willeth through His command. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Beneficent.Glorified art Thou, O my God! I testify, and all things testify, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and the divinity, Thine the force and the sapphire light, Thine the sovereignty and the human realm, Thine the glory and the majesty, Thine the countenance and the beauty, Thine the direction and the perfection, Thine the similitude and the examples, Thine the power and the deeds, Thine the mercy and the bounty, Thine the authority and the justice, Thine the stations and the grandeur, Thine the greatness and the independence, Thine the pride and the sublime glory, Thine the might and the invincibility, Thine the power and the deeds, Thine the joy and the gladness, Thine the sovereignty and the dominion, Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy command and creation.Thou hast ever existed before all things, and wilt exist after all things, and art the Creator of all things, the Essence above all things, and wilt exist after all things. Sanctified, O my God, are all Thy names, and exalted, O my Lord, are all Thy examples, and glorified, O my Beloved, are all Thy manifestations, and magnified, O my Desire, are all Thy attributes, and evident, O my Worshipped One, are Thy signs in all that Thou hast created and brought into being from before and after through Thy creative power.Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Independent, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, All-Encompassing, Most Holy, Everlasting, Enduring, Transcendent, Sublime, Invincible. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, nor hath there been any partner in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. Through Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them with precision, and through Thy Will Thou hast formed all things and shaped them with perfection.Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Whose sovereignty passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp escapeth not a thing, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.All praise be to God Who hath risen in His exaltation above all contingent beings, and ascended in His elevation above all existing things, and been established in His inaccessibility above all created things, and manifested His power above all atoms, and exhibited His dominion above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and revealed His appearance above all things, and demonstrated His triumph above all that hath been or will be created in the kingdoms of beginnings and endings. All His creation doth testify that there is no God but Him, the One, the Steadfast.He hath chosen an impregnable essence, a radiant abstraction, a lofty characteristic, a sublime quintessence, a majestic nature, an ancient disposition, and a wondrous camphor. Then He adorned it with itself and through it made Himself inaccessible from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself, whereupon there appeared from it what was within it.

And He cast into its identity the likeness of His Self, whereupon there appeared from it all that was within and upon it, filling thereby the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word. God hath chosen for Him primary and essential names, then immersed them in the ocean of eternal infinity, whereupon existence, both seen and unseen, was filled with the testimony that there is none other God but Him, the Dominant, the Fourth, the Self-Subsisting, the Fourth.In the Name of God, the Most Established, the Most Established! And verily all glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One, wherein naught can be seen save the First One. Furthermore, I bear witness that there is no establisher save God, exalted be His glory, His glory, and no established one save Him, exalted be His might. If thou shouldst acknowledge anyone in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest as being the Truth - nay, as being above description by truth - verily He shall verify the truth by His truth. For behold, thy essence deriveth from that Name, and the creation of thine essence was created through acknowledgment of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and He hath been endowed with the acknowledgment of God, through which God hath revealed Himself to Him by His own Self.Therefore, on the day of His manifestation, thou shalt acknowledge the truth as truth, and that which is not truth as that which God loveth not to be mentioned. And if thou desirest any of thy desires, observe in which attribute it falleth. If it falleth under wealth, say: "O Wealthy One! I have been enriched by wealth in the wealth of Thy wealth, O Wealthy One!" For verily God shall enrich thee through the means which He hath created in His dominion. And if thou desirest knowledge, say: "O All-Knowing! I have learned through knowledge in the knowledge of Thy knowledge, O All-Knowing!" And if thou desirest governance, say: "O All-Wise! I have governed through governance in the governance of Thy governance, O All-Wise!" And if thou desirest ministry, say: "O Minister! I have ministered through ministry in the ministry of Thy ministry, O Minister!" And if thou desirest sovereignty, say: "O Sovereign! I have ruled through sovereignty in the sovereignty of Thy sovereignty, O Sovereign!" And if thou desirest glory, say: "O Glorious One! I have been glorified through glory in the glory of Thy glory, O Glorious One!" And if thou desirest majesty, say: "O Majestic One! I have been invested with majesty in the majesty of Thy majesty, O Majestic One!"And likewise, observe the conditions of thy desires and what thy Lord hath ordained, and be not veiled from Him Whom thou callest upon. For verily the meaning of all prayers is Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His mention. If thou art guided by Him, then verily thou hast called upon God, thy Lord. Otherwise, thou hast called upon one whom thou knowest not. And how can God answer thy prayer when thou hast \[...\]

In His name, the Most Resplendent, the Most Resplendent!God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Most Resplendent, the Most Resplendent. Say: God is more resplendent than all who possess resplendence. None can escape from the dominion of His resplendent sovereignty, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth whatsoever He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath ever been resplendent, effulgent and glorious.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.Praise be unto God, Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them do glorify. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then Dominion over the world of creation. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Whose sovereignty passeth not away, the Just One Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Whose rule changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He pleaseth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Blessed be He Who possesseth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall cause to be manifested in the Book whatsoever He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Say: O people of the Bayan! All the Messengers are Him Whom God shall make manifest, if it be Him Whom ye seek.Say: O people of the Bayan! All the Books are the Book of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if it be that which ye seek.Say: O people of the Bayan! All the witnesses are Him Whom God shall make manifest, if it be Him Whom ye seek.Say: O people of the Bayan! All the gates are the gates of Him Whom God shall make manifest, if it be them whom ye seek.Say: O people of the Bayan! All the learned are those who believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, if it be them whom ye seek. This if ye be swimming in the ocean of creation.And if ye enter into the ocean of names, then say: There is no God but God, before and after, and there hath been no God but God, neither before nor after. All are His servants and all are prostrate before Him.His are all the most beautiful names in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever lieth between them, and His are the most sublime attributes in the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: O people of the Bayan! If ye wish to make mention of all the Prophets together, then make mention of the Primal Point if it be them whom ye seek. And if ye wish to make mention of all the Books, then make mention of the Bayan if it be that which ye love to mention. And likewise with the witnesses and the gates and all the believers. Therefore stray not from the ocean of the Bayan.

O all ye believers! Go ye not forth from the Ocean of the Bayan and enter not into seas that were created aforetime, for whatsoever ye seek therein is contained in this Ocean, for verily We are they that cause it to descend. Learn ye not any books except what hath been revealed in the Bayan, for whatsoever God hath revealed in all the Books was but that ye should recognize the Primal Point and believe with certitude in His verses. But they who were given the Book have veiled themselves from that which We revealed therein. We have revealed no Book but We promised those who believed in it that they would await the Day whereon We would reveal another Book, and they would believe in what was revealed therein and acknowledge him upon whom it would descend, for verily he is a Messenger from Our presence unto all the worlds. But all have veiled themselves from what We revealed in their Books save those who were given the Bayan, for they are at this time possessed of insight. They shall be tested on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. If they recognize God at the time of His manifestation and believe in the Manifestation of His Self on the Day of Resurrection, then shall they comprehend what We revealed in the Bayan. Otherwise they will not have understood a single letter and will have veiled themselves from God's purpose in the Bayan, though they imagine themselves possessed of insight. Nay, nay! The meaning of the Bayan is entirely about Him Whom God shall make manifest, and other than good is he who believeth not. If ye follow all the ordinances of the Bayan and guard against what God hath forbidden you therein, and comprehend the essence of the foundation, then shall your religion profit you. This is the path of God to which ye must hold fast. Imagine not that the aspects of God's commands are other than the aspects of the Primal Point, for that Point, when He bestoweth grace, manifesteth those aspects through which ye are exalted by the aspects of the Command. Watch over your souls that ye be not veiled from the essence of the foundation, and separate yourselves from all that God hath forbidden you, yet be not veiled from its source. For this Point hath not prostrated itself before God after having prostrated before God in the previous Manifestation, but when it prostrateth before God in the subsequent Manifestation, what it had prostrated before profiteth it not. And from all aspects of what is forbidden are ye to guard yourselves. Watch over your souls in the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for at the time of His appearance ye shall be tested like all other peoples. They believe in God their Lord, their Prophet, their Books, the witnesses of their Faith, and what God hath revealed of the ordinances of their religion. But when they believed not in God and then His Prophet in the subsequent Manifestation, and then what God revealed unto His Prophet of the paths of all things, their light was transformed into fire, and ye shall likewise be transformed on the Day of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Therefore watch over your souls that ye be not transformed. All your trials in the days of God's Manifestation, when God desireth to renew your religion, stem from your desire to remain firm in what ye have grown accustomed to in the religion before you. But God and those endowed with knowledge desire to sever you from your ways and cause you to enter into the true Faith, that perchance after your death ye may not enter into the fire.

Those who are given knowledge desire to cut you off from your tongues, then to make you enter into the true religion, so that after your death you may not enter the fire and may walk in the good pleasure of your Lord in your life and after your death. When one has attained the age of nineteen years and is among the believers in God and what was revealed in the Bayan, God shall make manifest Him Whom God shall make manifest on the night when his age enters into the twentieth year. Should he hear of the Manifestation of God or witness His signs and not be assured, then whatsoever he hath gained before shall be changed into that which God loveth not to mention. It is incumbent upon him, at the moment he heareth, to say "Yea" and to renew his being before his joy is turned to grief. This verily is the path of God; if ye all hold fast unto it, ye shall find deliverance more quickly than in the twinkling of an eye. And if anyone hath completed nineteen years of age and hath not believed in God in the Bayan, but when he heareth of the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, he saith "Yea, I am one of the believers," then at that moment his fire shall be changed to light and the creation of his heart, spirit, soul and body shall be renewed in all that pertaineth to him from his Lord. This is of the creation of the new Ridvan in the Book of God, and this is among those who have attained. Thus doth God show you the ways of your guidance and deliverance on the Day of His Manifestation, that ye may watch and be God-fearing. O people of the Bayan! We observe that ye are destroying the Point of your Cause while ye perceive not. When ye recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye shall believe in Him without doubt and be assured. But He Whom God shall make manifest shall Himself recognize His own Self, while ye shall doubt His Manifestation and shall not be assured. If ye are in doubt concerning this, then consider those who were given the Furqan when there came unto them what they were promised from Muhammad, the True, the Beloved. They heard the Manifestation of God but were not assured of Him and departed from that wherein they were, supposing they were doing good. Like unto them, when ye hear, ye doubt. Doubt not in God, your Lord, for if ye doubt in Him Whom God shall make manifest, it is as though ye had doubted in God your Lord. God hath created assurance in the heart of every soul at the moment it heareth of the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that it may say "Yea, I am the first of them that believe." Whether ye know this assurance or know it not, it is the sign between Him and His Lord whereby He worshippeth God, his Lord, by night and by day, and is among those who are assured in God. This is what God hath created in your hearts for your assurance in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Do ye not, then, have prior assurance in God, your Lord? This is your assurance in Him Whom God shall make manifest. God hath unveiled your sight, and We have lifted the veil from all your eyes through what We have revealed of these verses, that at the time of His manifestation ye may not doubt in God Who hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command, and may be assured in that moment. Are ye not assured in every Manifestation of God's Prophet, then believers in God's Book, then believers in what the Prophet hath ordained of witnesses, then in what the Prophet hath made manifest of the witnesses of His religion\[...\]

Do you not see that in every Dispensation of God's Prophet you believe, then believe in God's Book, then believe in those whom the Prophet has ordained as witnesses, then believe and are assured by what the Prophet has manifested of the witnesses of His religion and the laws which God has revealed unto Him? This Prophet is He Whom God shall make manifest, and this Book is what God shall send down, and these witnesses are they who are created by His command after they have believed in Him, and these are the guides who guide others to the exaltation of His remembrance, and these laws are what appear from Him, the Lord of His religion. God shows you the creation before you at the time when you are created after them, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection you may not be veiled from God's path, and that you may judge in the future as you have judged in the past.Say: The likeness of Him Whom God shall make manifest is as the likeness of the sun, and the likeness of that creation is as the likeness of mirrors. Is the sun multiplied at its rising or its setting? Say: Glory be to God, exalted above such a thing! Likewise, the Manifestation of God is not multiplied, and what has appeared before will appear hereafter. If you believe in Him Who appeared before, how is it that you do not believe with certainty in Him Who shall appear hereafter?This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce in the Book concerning the letter Mim and what was created after him, for We are the Announcers. O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from a beginning that had no beginning until now, that We might make thee know Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be of those who recognize.We have sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto those on that earth, and Our proof has been completed unto all the worlds. God hath created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them that those who have been given Books from God might believe with certainty in the meeting with their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, Our proof was completed unto thee even as it was completed unto all the worlds. And when thou didst see a sign or hear it, Our proof was perfected unto thee even as it was perfected in the Qur'an before, and We are indeed knowing of all things.If thou hadst said "yea" when thou didst hear and hadst presented thyself before God, thy Lord, and been of those who prostrate themselves, it would have been better for thee in God's sight than all thy worship of God, thy Lord, throughout thy life when thou wert of those who prostrate themselves. Behold, thou didst glory in Our names before, but when We made Our Self known unto thee, thou didst not manifest from what thou hadst gained through Us in Our path what thou wert capable of. Will what thou hast acquired profit thee if God doth not testify of His good pleasure with thee, after thou hast indeed labored throughout thy life to acquire deeds that God thy Lord might be pleased with thee, and that thou mightest be of those who are saved at the meeting with God?Behold, We have revealed in the Qur'an that none besides God can send down a sign, that perchance those who have been given the Qur'an might remember when they hear God's signs from His Proof, then become certain of them.

That ye may be among the saved ones in the Day of meeting with God. Behold, We have sent down in the Qur'an that none besides God is able to send down a verse, that perchance they who have been given the Qur'an, when they hear the verses of God from His Proof, may remember thereby and attain unto certitude. Verily God will question thee concerning those who veil themselves from the path of God while following thee. I am indeed Muhammad, your Qa'im, your Guide, your Mahdi, the Bearer of your rights and your Proof. Ye were all promised Me and the days of My manifestation. God hath manifested Me with a proof that hath rendered all creation impotent, and through it He established aforetime the religion of Islam, and ye all together now believe and are certain of it. All the sorrows We have witnessed, and which they who have believed in God have witnessed - God will surely question the divines concerning them, who have attributed themselves to Us while they judge in Our name. For had they turned unto Us, all would have turned. We would not have witnessed sorrow, and the Cause of God and His religion would have been manifested to all the world. And had thou believed in God on the first day with the first believers, We would surely have made thee among those nearest to God in thy knowledge, for We were able to do this. Behold how I exalted Muhammad Ali through mention of him and made him a Proof after Me unto all the worlds. Thus will God do as He willeth, for God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. But what was decreed for thee was decreed, and this befitteth not save those who are not veiled from God their Lord by anything, and who are preserved from all veils. If thou desirest to save thyself and attain unto that for which thou wast created, then verily We are manifest. And if thou desirest not this, then We are indeed independent of all things. But We counsel thee, for We are bountiful, that thou be not deceived by thy knowledge, nor be veiled from Him Who created thee, sustained thee, causeth thee to die and giveth thee life, and that thou be among those who prostrate themselves before Him night and day. For verily thou shalt die - there is no doubt in this - and return to dust. And after thy passing thou shalt witness that from which thou art warned, and God thy Lord is the Best of Judges. If thou wouldst remember and return, thou wouldst behold from God's bounty and mercy that He is the Best of the bountiful ones. And if thou wouldst remember after the matter is accomplished what verses were sent down, detailed from One All-Knowing, Inaccessible, Exalted, and sealed from One All-Wise, Most High - thou wouldst find no way thereto except that thou shouldst make content with thyself those souls who have believed in God and His verses and were among the sincere ones. And thou shalt surely write an exalted and lofty book to Him Whom God shall make manifest, and seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and counsel that should any of the believers reach Him, they should unfold it before God. Perchance God will change what causeth thee sorrow into what bringeth thee joy. Verily He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. The tenth chapter from the eighth Unity the twenty-eighth day of the twenty-eighth month of the year concerning the knowledge of the name "The Impeller" which hath four stations. The first in the first: In the Name of God, the Impeller, the Impeller. God - there is no God but He, the Impeller. Say: God is the Supreme Impeller above all impellers. None in the heavens \[...\]

He hath four stations. The first in the first: In the name of God, the Most Quickening, the Most Quickening. God - there is no God but Him, the Most Quickening. Say: God is the Most Quickening, above all possessors of quickening power. None can withhold himself from the dominion of His sovereign quickening, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath been the Quickener, the Most Quickening, the Quick to Quicken.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them make mention. Say: All are devoutly obedient unto Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby-like Splendor, then the Sovereignty and the Human realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Whose sovereignty passeth not away, and the Just One Who oppresseth not, and the Sovereign Whose dominion changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and what lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will drive the heavy clouds by His command as He willeth. Verily He hath power over all things.He it is Who created the heavens and the earth and what lieth between them, and God is knowing of all things.Say: God hath forbidden those who believe in God and His signs to make known to Him Whom God shall make manifest that which weigheth upon their hearts, even though they might tell Him "We desire that our hearts be assured through Thy remembrance and we wish to be numbered among the believers."God hath forbidden this unto them and unto those who have believed in God and His signs and who desire to be sincere in the religion of God. And should anything from Him Whom God shall make manifest occur to one's heart regarding the exaltation of His mention, if he uttereth it not with his tongue, God may perchance forgive him, for He hath been forgiving, merciful. But should his lips move, then that which God hath ordained in the Book shall be binding upon him. This is for those who believe in God and His signs and who desire to be sincere in the days of God.O ye who have been given the Bayan! Reflect ye upon the creation of your own selves. If ye do not rejoice in God, then make ye no mention before God of one who was not for Him and was against Him, even to the extent of the smallest particle, if ye have believed in God and His signs and desire to be among the beneficent in the religion of God.Therefore consider ye the fruits of what ye write or mention or discuss, for if ye benefit from that which giveth pleasure to your hearts, this cannot equal in the sight of God the grief of Him Whom God shall make manifest \[when there descendeth\] a verse while He is saddened, through which a soul is created. Therefore fear ye God, then fear ye Him. God hath set a limit for this in the Book, that ye may watch over yourselves, then on the Day of Resurrection before Him Whom God shall make manifest ye mention naught save that which was for Him. Verily We witness those who are upon the earth, how they are veiled from the path of God.

If ye desire to be among the beneficent in God's Faith, then consider ye the fruits of what ye write or mention or discuss. For if ye derive benefit from that which pleaseth your hearts, this would not equal in the sight of God the grief of Him Whom God shall make manifest when there descendeth upon Him a single verse that causeth Him sorrow. Therefore, fear ye God and unto Him be ye God-fearing. God hath set a limit for this in the Book that ye may watch over yourselves and speak naught but what beseemeth on the Day of Resurrection before Him Whom God shall make manifest. Verily We witness those who are upon the earth, how they are veiled from the path of God. And those who were veiled in the Bayan were like unto them, so why do ye mention before God that which ye do not guard against? Yea, should ye hear a single letter from Him Whom God shall make manifest - and it was a letter of exalted glory - ye should mention it before God and write it in your books and discuss it among yourselves, for by it shall ye be rewarded on the Day of Resurrection. Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Every utterance We have heard was a glory unto Us, and He hath given Us glad tidings from His presence. This is from God's bounty unto Us. Verily, He is the Best of those who show bounty. And We verily seek God's forgiveness for those who write unto Us that which We have not, or have but it is not glorious, or who make Us hear, or who mention before Us, or who convey unto Us at all times, before and after, that perchance they who are given the Bayan may be educated by what God hath commanded them in the Book and may guard against that which He hath forbidden them, that they may not mention before God on the Day of Resurrection that which beseemeth not God. Consider ye therefore the fruits of what ye mention. Can ye derive benefit from aught else but that which grieveth the Throne of God? Or can ye alter God's decree or His judgment? Yea, if ye can, then ye will be helping your own selves at the time of truth, and if ye cannot, then put your trust in God Who created the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, then unto Him commit ye all your affairs. His are the angels in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them who, by His leave, direct affairs in the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth between them, and who set aright the affairs of God's believing servants and who, by God's leave, lift from them whatsoever hath been decreed or ordained, as a bounty from God unto them. Verily He hath power over all things. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Do Thou assist with a mighty assistance those who have believed in God and His signs, and preserve them from before them and from behind them, and from their right and their left, and from above their heads and from beneath their feet, and from every quarter that reacheth unto them and all that they possess, through the angels of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Verily, Thou art the Most Preserving of preservers. And do Thou, O God, remove from the face of the earth such as desire not to believe in Thee and in Thy signs, and who cause grief unto Thy loved ones without right. And do Thou assist, O God, those who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, for Thou art the Best of helpers. And do Thou deliver them from the hands of those who recognize not their rights, for verily Thou art the Most Powerful of the powerful. And do Thou guide unto Thy Faith, O God, all who are on earth, as a bounty from Thy presence, for verily Thou art the Most Guided of guides.

O God! Guide all who are on earth to Thy Faith through Thy grace, for verily Thou art the Most Guiding of guides. O God! Reward Thy servants who aid the True Faith with the best Thou hast ordained, for verily Thou art the Most Excellent of the excellent ones. O God! Send down upon them from the treasuries of Thy grace and mercy that which will bring joy to their eyes, for verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.This is a Book from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, to the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Announce unto that land the letter Sad, for verily We are the Announcers. O thou! We created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make Ourselves known to thee through Our signs, that thou mayest be of those who recognize.Verily We have completed Our proof unto all who are on earth through what We have revealed of Books unto them and sent Messengers unto them, that they might remember in the days of God and be among the God-fearing in His Faith.Thou hast worshipped God thy Lord throughout thy life and wast among those who prostrate themselves before Us. And when thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, Our proof was completed unto thee even as it was completed unto all the worlds through what We had revealed aforetime in the Qur'an - that none other than God can reveal a verse - that those who were given the Qur'an might remember when they hear the verses of God and thereby attain certitude.Verily We created all things for the day of meeting with Us, yet all are veiled from that for which they were created, save those who have recognized God their Lord and are certain of His signs. These are they who are upon guidance from their Lord, and these are they who are guided.When thou didst hear of the Manifestation of God, hadst thou said "Yea, verily we are certain of God and His signs," it would have been better in the Book of God than all thy worship of God thy Lord throughout thy life when thou wast among those who worship Us.Say: Glory be unto Thee, O God! Verily Thou art the Knower of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Thou bestowest knowledge upon whom Thou willest and takest it from whom Thou willest. Thou exaltest whom Thou willest and abaseth whom Thou willest. Thou enrichest whom Thou willest and impoverishest whom Thou willest. Thou aidest whom Thou willest and forsaketh whom Thou willest. Thou honorest whom Thou willest and humblest whom Thou willest. In Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily Thou art powerful over all things.Thou causest the night to pass into day and the day to pass into night. Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. Thou providest sustenance for whom Thou willest beyond what any can reckon.Say: Verily We bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, and We create what We will by Our command. Verily We are powerful over all things.God thy Lord hath given thee what He hath given to no one else in all the worlds. And if thou hadst recognized what God had given thee, thou wouldst surely have been among those who prostrate themselves before God.Thus shall God create on the Day of Resurrection those who believe in God \[...\]

Wert thou to recognize that which God hath bestowed upon thee, thou wouldst assuredly be among those who prostrate themselves before God. Thus shall God create on the Day of Resurrection those who believe in God and His signs. He is, verily, the Most Excellent Creator.Say: On the Day of Resurrection, neither your bodies nor your lineage shall profit you. That which shall profit you is your faith in God, your Lord. Through this shall ye enter Paradise.Behold how We created the people of the Furqan by Our command. Verily, We are powerful over all things. Had but one among them believed, We would have made thee like unto him whom We manifested from that Tree, as a token of Our grace. We are, in truth, the All-Bountiful.Observe how God shall raise up on the Day of Resurrection the Leaders of Religion, then the daughter of Muhammad, the Apostle of God, the Lord of all worlds. Then the Gates of Guidance, the God-fearing Guides of God, through their faith in God, their Lord, when We made known unto them Our Self - there is no God but I, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.All proclaimed: "Yea! Glory be unto Thee! There is no God but Thee. Verily, Thou art the God of gods!" Through their faith have We raised them up and created them in the next life. Thus shall ye, too, be raised up and created on the Day of Resurrection. Nothing shall profit you on that Day save your faith in Him Whom God shall make manifest, and your prostration before God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all that is seen and unseen, the Lord of all worlds.If thou desirest to save those who follow thee, cause them to return unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. And when the matter is concluded and they desire to return, be thou content with those who have believed in God, thy Lord, and bid them write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, seeking His forgiveness.Should the Books be spread before God, perchance He will change denial into affirmation through His grace. Verily, there is no God but He, the Second Forgiver in the Second, the Protector, the Best-Beloved.In the Name of God, the Most Exalted, the Most Exalted!Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I and all things bear witness that Thou art God. There is no God but Thee, alone, with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the Dominion, the Might and the Power, the Strength and the Divinity, the Force and the Sapphire, the Sovereignty and the Human realm. Thine are Glory and Majesty, the Countenance and the Direction and Perfection, the Highest Example and all Examples, the Stations and the Grandeur, the Greatness and Independence, the Mercy and Grace, the Authority and Justice, the Pride and Sublimity, the Honor and Inaccessibility, the Power and Deeds, the Joy and Gladness, the Sovereignty and Might.Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the Kingdom of Thy Command and Creation. Thou hast ever been before all things, existing after all things, transcendent above all things, and the Creator of all things. Thou wilt ever remain one God, Single, Eternal, Individual, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Everlasting, Inaccessible, Exalted, Most High, Ruling, All-Possessing, All-Powerful. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son.All are Thy servants and within Thy grasp. Thou givest life and death, then causest death and givest life. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the King Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Sovereign Who changeth not.

In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God Who hath ascended through His transcendence above all created things, and risen through His exaltation above all existing things, and stood unapproachable through His inaccessibility above all atoms, and manifested His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and demonstrated His dominion above all created beings, and revealed His appearance above all atoms, and shown His conquest above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Him do all His creation testify that there is none other God but He, the One, the Most High.He hath chosen an impenetrable Essence, a radiant Abstraction, an exalted Simplicity, a lofty Being, a magnificent Simplicity, and a beloved Form. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, and through it He became inaccessible from it, and He cast into its reality its own likeness. Then there appeared from it what was within it and upon it, and thereby were filled the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but He, and that the Essence of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word.He hath chosen for Himself essential, manifest names, then immersed them in the sea of timeless eternity, whereby existence was filled, from the kingdom of the unseen to the empire of the visible, testifying that there is none other God but He, the One, the Inaccessible, the Most High, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.In the name of God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious!Praise be to God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Most Glorious, the Most Glorious. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity. Furthermore, I testify that there is no glorifier save God, exalted be His majesty, and none sufficeth except Him, mighty be His might. If thou manifesteth that attribute in the path of Him Whom God shall make manifest, then verily thy reality proclaimeth that Name, for thou art indeed among those who seek evidence of God, beside Whom there is none other God, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High.In the name of God, the Most Innovative, the Most Innovative!God, there is none other God but He, the Most Innovative. Say: God is more innovative than all possessors of innovation. None can escape from the sovereignty of His innovation's dominion, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily He hath ever been the Innovator, the Producer, the Originator.Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom bow down in worship all who are in the heavens and who are on the earth and what lieth between them. Say: All are devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is none other God but He. His are the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Empire, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Ruby Essence, then the Sovereignty and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not.

Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the Sovereign Whose dominion passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Ruler Whose authority changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. He, verily, hath power over all things.Blessed is He unto Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of whatever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.Exalted is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: God will verily speak to you in the Book concerning the discourse of Him Whom God shall make manifest, that ye may be prepared for the Day of God's manifestation and may be God-fearing.O people of the Bayan! Watch over your souls on the Day when one shall come with a Book and shall inform you of the remembrance of his Lord. Verily, there is no God but I, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Do not confront the proof, but rather ponder the words revealed from His presence. If your hearts become assured, then blessed are ye, for ye are the believers. Otherwise, utter not a word of denial before God, for He will judge you. Be patient until God grants you certitude, and beyond God there is no certitude, if ye be of them that are certain.If ye were certain that this is Him Whom God shall make manifest, ye would believe without doubt and would aid Him. But ye doubt without proof or evidence, and think yourselves God-fearing.Doubt not on the Day of God's manifestation, and believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and fear God, that He may relate to you the discourse of Him Who was made manifest, that ye may take heed thereof.God sent down the Furqan (Quran) and was patient with those who were given the Furqan for one thousand two hundred and seventy years until they filled a portion of the earth with those who believed in the Furqan. And therein were established five sovereignties whose names were struck upon coins. God manifested what He had promised through Muhammad, the Messenger of God, in one of their kingdoms. All of them believed in the Primal Point and then in the living Furqan.All of them supplicate for the day of His manifestation and all of them beseech. And the length of their land equals two months' journey when horsemen travel with wondrous speed.God hath closed all the gates of denial for those who were given the Furqan through what was revealed therein - that none besides God could reveal the like of the Furqan. This indeed sufficeth those who have embraced Islam, that those who have believed in it might watch for this Day of God's manifestation and deduce thereby, then believe.When God made manifest the Truth among these people, God is ashamed to mention what they earned. And there were none before God save two who wrote what was revealed from His presence, while all were supplicating and beseeching within themselves.The Truth was alone, and remember ye the years of the letter Ha, then what befell the Truth therein, for We are ashamed to mention it while ye ponder upon the number of the name of the Manifest One.This is the fruit of their supplications and their beseeching for the manifestation of their Lord, after all were prostrating before Us night and day.O people of the Bayan! Look not upon yourselves as being other than them, for verily ye are like unto them \[...\]

O people of the Bayan! Look not upon yourselves as being other than them, for verily ye are like unto them, except if ye dissociate yourselves from their deeds and believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Yet while that which ye were created for is being revealed, ye remain heedless. Perchance ye behold that which ye worship night and day, yet ye rejoice not in it. By the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest! Were ye not to grieve Him, He would be independent of your joy. Therefore watch over your souls, for ye are they who supplicate.Consider those who were given the Gospel - how they all supplicated and implored their Lord God that He might reveal unto them what Jesus, Son of Mary, Spirit of God and His Word, had promised them concerning him who would come in the name of Ahmad, the Messenger of God from God, the Lord of the worlds. Yet when he came to them, they followed their monks and veiled themselves from God their Lord, and they remain to this hour patient in the fire of their veils.And ye, O people of the Bayan, are awaiting likewise. Therefore watch over your souls, and watch lest ye exchange your affirmation from the first revelation of the Bayan until the time it is lifted up, against that which ye are warned of. For on the Day of Fruits, which is the day of His manifestation, if ye remain veiled ye shall possess nothing, but if ye recognize the Manifestation of your Lord, then shall ye attain all good, both past and future.However, God hath servants whose hearts are like unto mountains; they manifest the Cause of God from Him Whom God shall make manifest, and they fear no one. Even as God hath manifested in this Resurrection one who is remembered by the name of Ali from India, mighty and impregnable. After he heard God's decree in a luminous Book, he became established upon the throne of his might and manifested God's Cause as befitteth one who is among the powerful ones. Say: How lofty is his elevation in every exalted mention!Until certain believers rendered him victorious and became sorrowful in his path, until one was raised unto God his Lord - he who became sorrowful in His path and was among the helpers. And the other remained and gained insight in the path of God, and was among those who are certain of God and His signs. Then like unto this was one strong, strengthened, and mighty, whose name equalled the name of thy Lord, the Possessor of Bounty and Might, the Exalted. He delivered the Cause of his Lord in his land to one who knew him not - this is a hidden and wondrous mystery.Thus doth God strengthen the hearts of His believing servants. This is a Book from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point: Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce in the Book unto him whose name is the mention of thy Lord's name, the Mighty, the Bestower. Verily We have been in the Book among the Announcers.O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, that thou mightest recognize Our Self through Our signs and be among those who attain recognition. We sent the Messenger and revealed the Book unto thee and unto those upon that earth, yet We found thee not among those who were certain of God and His signs, even after thou hadst worshipped God throughout thy life\[...\]

And His verses among those who are certain of faith, after having worshipped God throughout your life and having been among those who prostrate themselves. When you attained certitude in the Primal Point, then you were among those who were certain of God and His verses. And when you comprehended His presence, then you were among those who comprehended the presence of God. We made you for the day of Our meeting, and you ascended to a House We had attributed to Our own Self, and you were among those who made the House a dwelling for those who were veiled. Verily the House was exalted by Our having attributed it to Our own Self, and We were the God of that House and its Lord. The House and all who dwell around it glorify God, their Lord, at all times, before all time and after all time. You were given naught of the essence of knowledge, yet We gave you that which, were you to pride yourself upon it before all who dwell in the kingdoms of heaven and earth and what lieth between them, you would be worthy of being among those who take pride. We made your son, by virtue of his having believed in God in the First Unity, to be among the martyrs of truth from aforetime, and verily We are powerful over all things. And were you to recognize his station, you would surely be among those who prostrate before him. And you would surely render all that God hath given you of earthly dominion into pure gold, then would you consider it equal to the sandals of your son, then would you give in charity on his behalf, for he believed in God at the time of His manifestation and was among the sincere ones. And you shall return in the Bayan and take pride in believing in him even as all the world taketh pride therein. And marvel not at this, but reflect upon the time when God sent down the command concerning Ali from Muhammad, the Messenger of God, that you might be enabled to be among those who understand. Say: Praise be to God Who hath given me one who believed in God, his Lord, at the time of His manifestation, and God, his Lord, made him among the guides of old, and God gave him what He had given to none else in all the worlds, inasmuch as He caused him to ascend unto Himself with those who ascend. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily Thou art the Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of what lieth between them. Thou givest bounty unto whomsoever Thou willest and withdrawest bounty from whomsoever Thou willest. Thou exaltest whomsoever Thou willest and abaseth whomsoever Thou willest. Thou aideth whomsoever Thou willest and forsaketh whomsoever Thou willest. Thou enrichest whomsoever Thou willest and impoverisheth whomsoever Thou willest. Thou raiseth unto Thyself whomsoever Thou willest and granteth the meeting with Thy Self to whomsoever Thou willest. Within Thy grasp are the kingdoms of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth beneath them. Thou createst what Thou willest how Thou willest. Verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the Most Powerful, the Almighty. Thou causeth the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night. Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. Thou enrichest whomsoever Thou willest among Thy servants beyond what any can reckon. And even as Our proof was completed against thee aforetime in the Furqan, so hath Our proof been completed against thee thereafter in the Bayan, and verily We are cognizant of all things. And hadst thou said "yea" when thou didst hear, it would have been better for thee than all thy life's worship of God, thy Lord, even hadst thou been among the sincere ones. And God hath taken from thee two lofty fruits, both of whom believed in God, their Lord, and were among the sincere ones. Thus doth a believer's son benefit his father on the Day of Resurrection. Verily We are the Bestower. It behooveth one who hath believed \[...\]

The child of the believer shall meet his father on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, We have been bountiful. It behooveth thee, when thy child hath believed in God, the Lord of all worlds, to present him before thee and glory in what thou hast acquired of an exalted and lofty deed. Thou shouldst present his allegiance to all who are on earth, treat kindly the believers, and elevate the Cause of thy Lord with the power thou possessest, even as thou wert, in thy lifetime, among those who described the Imams of truth aforetime. We have written unto thee a letter with Our own hands and given thee insight that thou mayest be, on the Day of Resurrection, among the helpers. We have drawn nigh unto thy land and thou hast become aware of what We had revealed aforetime in the Furqan, and thou wert among the believers. Watch thou for the Day when God shall come in the shadows of clouds with angels round about Him. Thou hast not grasped the meaning of what thou didst read and wert not among those present. Thou didst not aid the Cause of thy Lord though thou wert among those capable in thy land. Thou didst not answer what God had sent down to thee in His script, though thou didst reckon thyself among those who reflect. Of what profit is thy reflection in thy worldly life when thou hast not answered God, the Lord of all worlds? And if thou hast preserved the proofs of truth in thy house, this shall profit thee before God more than thy lifetime's striving - this hath returned to God from thee, if thou art among those who possess insight. If thou dost remember before the matter is concluded, then blessed be those who return. God shall send down unto thee that which shall please thy heart of manifest and exalted verses, and evident and impregnable words. If thou art patient until the matter is concluded and desirest to be among the guided ones, then satisfy the proofs of thy Lord above thy land and write unto Him Whom God shall make manifest a lofty, exalted, and elevated book. Command those who follow thee to seek forgiveness of God, their Lord, in the Book, for verily We have been bountiful. And command that one of the believers shall reach the Day of His manifestation. May God bear witness unto thee with that which shall please thy heart from God, the One, the Kind. Say: The grace of God and His mercy have encompassed all things, and all shall enter into the mercy and grace of their Lord and therein shall they abide. Say: Praise be to God Who hath concealed what We have believed, and my child, in the Manifestation of His Self on the Day of Resurrection, and hath honored me in the Book from His presence. Verily, He is the Most Generous of the generous ones. This is from God's grace upon me. Verily, He is the Second Gate, the Most Bountiful of the bountiful ones \[...\]

Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All bow down in worship before Him.And praise be to God before Whom all who are in the heavens and all who are on earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are submissive to His will.God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Glory and the Might, then the Power and the Divinity, then the Strength and the Ruby-like Splendor, then the Sovereignty and the realm of human limitations. He causeth to live and to die, then causeth to die and to live, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Whose sovereignty passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Whose dominion changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. He createth what He willeth through His command. He, verily, hath ever been the All-Compelling, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.Blessed be He Who is the Sovereign of the heavens and of the earth and of whatsoever is between them. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Exalted be He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is none other God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God will protect you from the fire if ye seek His protection. And whoso seeketh the protection of another, it behooveth him not to refuse it, whether he be a believer or not. O people of the Bayan! Watch over your souls that ye may grant protection to all who seek your shelter, that perchance on the Day of Resurrection ye may be rewarded with the best of what God possesseth.Glorified be God above whatsoever those who remember Him remember, and whatsoever those who act may do. Say: All shall seek protection through Him Whom God shall make manifest. He shall deliver them from their veils that hide them from His Self, and He shall accept them all when they seek His protection.Say: God protecteth and none can prevail against His protection. Ye shall witness this attribute in Him Whom God shall make manifest. And commit not any deed that would cause grief to Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor engage in any act whereof God would be ashamed to make mention, for such deeds shall cause your destruction on the Day of Resurrection when ye are veiled from Him.Should the exponents of Him Whom God shall make manifest seek your protection, then shall ye seek protection after they have proved their worthiness. It behooveth them not to grant protection, rather should all seek their protection that they may deliver them on the Day of Resurrection from their Lord and cause them to enter Paradise among the God-fearing. Watch over your souls, O people of the Bayan, for on that Day the true exponents will be manifest among you in truth and will be concealed within you in truth. Watch over your souls that ye may believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest and then treat well His exponents, for verily ye call upon the names of your Lord day and night.Say: He is the Subduer over His creation, the Manifest above His servants, and the Compeller over all that He hath created and will create by His command. He is the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.God counseleth you concerning the companions of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for verily ye shall be gladdened by them. Never cause them grief - this is that whereby ye shall be delivered on the Day of Resurrection.This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.Make mention in the Book of him who is God-fearing, for We have ever been mindful thereof.O thou! Verily We have created thee \[...\]

He is the All-Prevailing, the Self-Subsisting!God counsels you concerning the companions of Him Whom God will make manifest. You should not grieve them, for it is through them that you shall attain joy everlasting. This is that whereby you shall be delivered on the Day of Resurrection.This is a Book from God, the All-Prevailing, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.Make mention in the Book of one who is God-fearing, for verily We have been ever-mindful. O thou! We have created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and given thee life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment, that We might make Ourself known unto thee through Our signs, that thou mightest be among those who recognize.God hath manifested Muhammad, your Guardian, your Guide, your Mahdi, the Lord of your Religion, and ye make mention of Him through the Most Beautiful Names. Through proofs hath God established therewith the religion of Islam aforetime, and ye all believe therein and are assured thereof.The Messenger delivered unto thee the command of thy Lord, yet thou wast not among the mindful. When thou didst hear a verse or witness a sign, Our proof was completed against thee, even as it was completed aforetime in the Furqan, for We are indeed cognizant of all things. We created thee for the day of meeting with Us, yet thou wast not among those who prostrated themselves before Us, even after We drew nigh unto thy land and made mention of thee in an exalted and glorious Book, inscribed by the hand of God, the Inaccessible, the All-Powerful.After God made Us the Manifestation of His Self - and it behooveth Us not to seek protection while all seek protection through Us - when We were constrained in Our Cause, We sought protection in the Book that thou mightest be ashamed before God thy Lord and be among those who seek protection, inasmuch as We made thee among the powerful in that land.Say: Thou didst glory in Our names throughout thy life and wast among those who prostrated before Us night and day. Thou didst worship God thy Lord in thy lifetime and wast among the sincere ones unto Us. Yet thou wouldst teach prayer to those who follow thee as though thou hadst not grasped the meaning of prayer and wast not among the discerning. All prayer is praise of Our Self, if thou be of the assured ones.We have not witnessed in thee the bounds of humanity - how then couldst thou be numbered among the learned ones? When We heard that when the Book of thy Lord reached thee, thou didst cast it aside, supposing thyself to be among the doers of good. Nay! By this act We have chastised thee with the chastisement of all worlds.Had thou taken up the Book of thy Lord, placed it upon thine eyes, and sought victory for the Cause of thy Lord through the power thou didst possess, it would have been better for thee than all thy lifetime of worship unto God thy Lord. But now not even the smallest thing can profit thee.Consider: Is there anyone in God's knowledge who would seek protection through God while failing to protect Him, even after worshipping Him night and day and being among those who prostrate? We desired thereby to test thee, else We are indeed independent of all things. Not one who followeth Us would consider thee within the chain of humanity - how then could We seek protection through thee? Yet We have revealed this to test thee and to make thee among the submissive ones.Without doubt, when thou didst this deed, thou didst not recognize that this was a Book from God, the Inaccessible, the All-Powerful.

Without doubt thou, when thou didst commit this act, failed to recognize that this was a Book from God, the Inaccessible, the Sublime. But though thou didst not recognize it, We have recognized thee and perfected Our proof against thee, yet thou wast not among those who perceived.Thou didst worship God, thy Lord, throughout thy life and wast among those who prostrated themselves before Us, yet the tree of thy faith bore no fruit. Say: Yea! Rather, the bounds of humanity require that when a letter reaches thee, thou shouldst answer it truthfully, whether thou be among the helpers or among those who hold back.O people of the Bayan! Watch over your souls lest ye transgress the bounds of humanity, for these shall profit you more than aught else whereby ye derive benefit among men. Verily, in the sight of God, an unbeliever who is courteous is better than one who believeth yet showeth no courtesy. The bounds of humanity must needs be manifest in oneself. O people of humanity! Ye walk within human bounds.God will assuredly question thee concerning those who followed thee. Thou didst teach knowledge that thou mightest save thyself, yet thou didst cast into the fire those who followed thee without right or clear proof. If thou returnest unto Us, We shall forgive what We have witnessed from thee and shall transform the fire into light. Verily, We have been forgiving. Our mercy hath encompassed all things, and We have been bountiful.Say: Our forgiveness diminisheth not when We manifest it unto all peoples, nor do the veils of creation harm Us, for We have been just. Rather, they who perform good deeds - these are they who taste the fruits of the Tree of Paradise. And they who perform other than good deeds - these are they who are tormented by the fruits of the Tree of Fire.Your very deeds are your paradise in God's good-pleasure, and your fire in that which is other than His good-pleasure, if ye would but briefly ponder your actions. Though thou rememberest after the matter hath been decreed what was revealed in the Book whose verses have been perfected by the All-Knowing, the Exalted, the Sublime, thou shalt find no way to that which God hath witnessed except if thou desirest to be among the guided ones.Therefore, content those who have believed in God and His signs and who have been among the assured in God's religion. Write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest, seek forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and charge that one of the believers should deliver it unto Him. Perchance God will transform negation into affirmation through His grace. Verily, He hath been All-Forgiving, Forgiver, Most Forgiving.This is a Book from God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce thou the like of that Name in number, for We have been among the Announcers.O thou! We created thee, sustained thee, favored thee, and gave thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make known unto thee Our Self through Our signs, that thou mayest be among those who recognize. The Messenger delivered unto thee the command of thy Lord, yet thou wast not among the mindful ones. When thou didst hear of God's Manifestation or beheld a sign from among thy Lord's signs, Our proof was perfected against thee even as it was perfected aforetime in the Qur'an, and We have been cognizant of all things.We revealed in the Qur'an that none other than God can send down a single verse, that perchance they who were given the Qur'an might remember when they hear God's verses from His Proof, and then attain certitude.

Verily We were cognizant of all things. We have revealed in the Furqan that none other than God can send down a verse, that perchance those who have been given the Furqan, when they hear the verses of God from His Proof, may remember them and then become assured. And God hath manifested what thou wert remembering night and day, and thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life and wert among those who prostrate themselves before Us. And thou didst seek glory through Our names and didst reckon thyself among the diligent ones. Yet the tree of thy faith bore not the word "yea," and if it bore not "nay" We would have no need of this or that, for verily We were witnesses over all things. And thou didst make thyself one who denied Ahmad, the exalted Path of Truth, then denied Him Who came with the Truth after him, and verily He is the mighty, impregnable Path. Thou didst embrace both denials at the end of night, then denied the Primal Point at the beginning of day, and didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing. Nay, nay! The God-fearing are those who grieve not anyone in all the worlds. And when they hear words they ponder them, then reflect, and if they comprehend not aught therein, they ask him who revealed it and judge not concerning him. These are they who fear God in religion and are sincere. If they understand not the words of one above them, they testify to their own powerlessness and judge not concerning him. They say: "Glory be unto Thee, O God! There is no God but Thee. Verily Thou wilt judge on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they fabricate. If Thou judgest him who spoke those words or \[wrote\] that Book with his own consent, then Thou art the Most Excellent of the excellent ones. It is not for us to judge any of Thy servants, for Thou art the Most Wise of judges. And if Thou hast not testified concerning this one against that one with clear proofs from Thy presence, then inspire him, O God, with guidance from the unseen depths of his heart, and pardon what Thou hast witnessed against him without his consent, for Thou art the Most Forgiving of the forgiving ones. It is not for us to cause grief to any of Thy servants, for Thy grace and mercy have encompassed all things, and Thou art the Best of the bountiful ones." Say: Thus do the God-fearing speak. And when thou didst hear and remember not, the matter was altered in thy soul and thou wert not among the assured ones, else thou wouldst have been among those who return. And God will surely question thee concerning those who followed thee while they were veiled from God's path. If thou rememberest on the Day of Resurrection and returnest unto God, thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, God will surely change affliction to blessing through His grace, for He is the Best of the bountiful ones. But if thou waitest until the matter is accomplished, thou shalt find no way thereunto. However, God hath opened unto those who desire guidance a door of bountiful grace. Therefore make those who have believed in God and His verses in thy land content with thyself, and command those who followed thee to do likewise, for this is of God's grace unto the believers. Then write thou a letter unto Him Whom God shall make manifest and enjoin that one of the believers deliver it unto Him. God may well change denial into affirmation through His grace, for He is the Best of the bountiful ones. Glory be unto Thee, O God! Verily Thou art the Forgiver of the heavens \[...\]

And thou shalt assuredly enjoin that should any of the believers reach unto Him, God may, through His grace, transform exile into establishment. Verily, He is the most excellent of those who show excellence. Glory be unto Thee, O Lord! Verily, Thou art the Forgiver of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Do Thou forgive, O Lord, Thy servants who seek forgiveness, for Thou art the Most Forgiving of the forgiving. And do Thou, O Lord, accept the repentance of Thy servants who turn unto Thee, for Thou art the Most Accepting of those who accept repentance. Thy mercy hath encompassed all things, and Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. Thy bounty hath embraced all who dwell in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and Thou art the Most Bountiful of the bountiful. All were created through Thy generosity, and Thou art the Most Generous of the generous.The twenty-third chapter of the twenty-eighth Vahid of the twenty-eighth month of the year concerning the knowledge of the Name of Mystery, which hath four stages. The first in the first first.In the Name of God, the Captive, the Captive.Say: God is the Captive above every captive. None in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them can escape from the sovereignty of His dominion over His captives. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He is the Ever-Moving, the Mover, the All-Compelling. Glorified be He before Whom prostrate themselves whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him. And praise be to God before Whom bow down in worship whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. Say: All are devoted unto Him.God beareth witness that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Human Realm. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just One Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever lieth between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed be He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Exalted be He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall cause you to journey through the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever lieth between them, that ye may, in every Resurrection, believe in God and His signs with certitude. O all things! We have indeed caused you to journey from a beginning that hath no beginning unto what We have brought you in the Bayan, that ye may bear witness that there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Concealer, and that ye may believe in the Primal Point and what God hath revealed unto Him, and that ye may prepare yourselves to attain unto the presence of your Lord in the next Resurrection.Verily, We shall cause you to journey from this moment unto an end that hath no end, and We are never heedless of anything. Were it not for the possibility of creating a thing, it would have no existence, so how could it be mentioned thereafter? And verily We make possible the creation of what hath been created and what shall be created by Our command, and We are powerful over all things. And verily We have dominion over all things, and verily We are supreme over all things.

Verily We were, over all things, the Withholders, and verily We were, over all things, the All-Subduing, and verily We were, over all things, the Manifestors. Say: Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the visible and invisible, Lord of all the worlds. He it is Who directs your course on land and sea by His command, and protecteth you on your path through the angels of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall cause all things to appear from a single thing - that Primal Point - from the beginning that hath no beginning to the end that hath no end, and by it are ye created. Say: All do worship Us. Say: All do prostrate before Us. Say: All are devoted unto Us. Say: All do remember Us. Say: All do thank Us. Say: All do praise Us. Say: All do seek Us.And God is triumphant over His servants and manifest above what He hath created and createth through what He hath revealed in the Book from His presence. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Say: Verily God hath caused all things to enter beneath the shadow of the Tree of Affirmation, save those who, of their own accord, do reason. They have power either to believe in God their Lord and then place their trust in God their Lord, or to veil themselves from God their Lord, or to disbelieve in the signs of God.For these two paths move through two seas - the sea of negation and affirmation. They who have believed in God and His signs, in every Revelation they follow what God hath revealed in the Book. These are they whom God hath created from the fruits of Paradise, and these are they who attain. And they who believe not in God and His signs in every Revelation, these are they who move in the sea of negation.God hath bound Himself that He will cause the sea of affirmation to prevail through His command and will bring to naught the sea of negation through His power. Verily He hath power over all things.And ye should recognize God your Lord at every Revelation that ye enter not into negation. Before God manifesteth any Prophet, ye are assured in the sea of affirmation. But when a Messenger cometh to you from God and ye follow him not, then doth God transform your light into fire. Therefore watch over your souls that ye may be saved through God and His signs.This is a Book from God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, unto the Primal Point. Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved.We have announced in the Book he who maketh mention in the land of Ali, for verily We have been the Announcers.O thou! Verily We created thee and sustained thee and caused thee to die and brought thee to life from the beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We caused thee to know Our Self through Our signs, that thou mightest be of them that know. And We have caused thee to know Our Self through Our signs as a Messenger unto all the worlds.We created thee for the day of meeting with Us, and verily We are cognizant of all things. Behold how We have tried those who were given the Furqan after We had revealed therein that none other than God could reveal a single verse. Therefore watch thyself on the Day of Resurrection lest thou be among the remote ones.

Verily We have been knowing of all things. Behold how We have tried those who were given the Qur'an, after We revealed therein that none but God can send down verses. Therefore watch thyself on the Day of Resurrection lest thou be among those who are far removed. Our proof upon thee is that whoso is upon that land was upon guidance and the path of assured truth. Even as We perfected Our proof upon thee aforetime in the Qur'an, We have now perfected Our proof upon thee in the Bayan, and verily We have been witness unto all things. If at the end of night thou hadst followed the path of God in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, He would assuredly have saved thee on the Day of Resurrection and caused thee to enter an exalted and wondrous paradise. But when thou didst hear and remain veiled, how can that which thou hast acquired profit thee? God is the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Powerful. Behold, thou didst worship God thy Lord throughout thy life and wast among those who prostrated themselves before Us. Yet when We made Ourself known unto thee through Our signs, thou wast not among those who recognized. Hadst thou not been veiled from the path of truth there, thou wouldst not have placed thyself among the veiled ones at night. And verily in the daytime when thou didst hear, We perfected Our proof upon thee, and God will surely question thee concerning those who follow thee. Say: All return unto God their Lord. Thou didst acquire knowledge that thou mightest save others among the believers, yet thou didst veil thyself from the path of God, and likewise those who followed thee, and thou didst reckon thyself among the learned ones. Hadst thou attained unto true knowledge, thou wouldst have been guided by the signs of God and been among those possessed of certitude. Should all who are in the heavens and on earth and whatsoever lieth between them gather together to produce the like of that Book, they would never be able, even were they the most learned ones on earth, even were they the most powerful ones on earth. This is Our proof against all who dwell in the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and whatsoever lieth between them - all are powerless before it, all bow down before it in truth. God is triumphant in His Cause, manifest above His servants, and sovereign over all who dwell in the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatsoever lieth between them by His command, and verily He is the Strong, the Mighty, the Exalted. Before Him prostrate themselves all who are in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them, and unto Him is the final return. Enter not thyself into the religion of God, but hold fast unto that which God hath revealed in the Book. Thou shalt surely die and return to dust, and naught of what thou hast acquired shall profit thee. Therefore save thyself and those who follow thee through God and His signs, for this indeed is the great bounty. And if thou remember in the days of God and return unto God, the Lord of all worlds, God will surely reveal in the Book that which will gladden thy heart, as a grace from His presence - verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The matter hath been decreed and thou shalt find no way unto that. And if thou desire thereafter to be among those who are saved, then follow thou the path of truth and make thyself and those who have believed in God and His signs and are sincere in His religion to be content. And write thou unto Him Whom God shall make manifest an exalted and elevated letter, and seek thou forgiveness of God thy Lord therein.

Ask forgiveness of God thy Lord therein, and counsel that should any of the believers attain unto His presence, God may transform negation into affirmation. Verily, He hath been the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the All-Bountiful. All are His servants and all believe in God and His verses.O my God! I bear witness, and all things bear witness, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the Kingdom and the dominion, Thine the might and the power, Thine the strength and divinity, Thine the force and sovereignty, Thine the dominion and the realm of creation, Thine the glory and majesty, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the direction and perfection, Thine the power and deeds, Thine the likeness and examples, Thine the stations and grandeur, Thine the mercy and bounty, Thine the authority and justice, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the pride and magnificence, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the might and exaltation, Thine the joy and gladness, Thine the sovereignty and power, and Thine is whatsoever Thou hast loved or wilt love in the kingdom of Thy Cause and creation. Thou hast ever been existent before all things, permanent after all things, the Creator of all things, and the Sustainer after all things. Nothing escapeth Thy knowledge in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them, and nothing frustrateth Thee in the kingdom of Command and Creation and whatsoever is beneath them.O God! By Thy glory, Thy majesty, Thy beauty, Thy grandeur, Thy light, Thy mercy, Thy words, Thy perfection, Thy names, Thy might, Thy will, Thy knowledge, Thy power, Thy utterance, Thy questions, Thy nobility, Thy sovereignty, Thy dominion, Thy loftiness and whatsoever are Thy names and examples, do Thou lift every sorrow that Thou hast created or wilt create from those who are in the Bayan. And O God! By Thy glory, Thy majesty, Thy beauty, Thy grandeur, Thy light, Thy mercy, Thy words, Thy perfection, Thy names, Thy might, Thy will, Thy knowledge, Thy power, Thy questions, Thy nobility, Thy sovereignty, Thy dominion, Thy loftiness and whatsoever are Thy names and examples, do Thou send down every joy, delight, exaltation, invincibility, might and majesty that Thy knowledge hath encompassed upon those whom Thou hast caused to enter the Bayan, for Thou hast not wished that in that Paradise there should be witnessed that which beseemeth not Thy face, O Thou Who art the Lord of might and sovereignty, and O Thou Who art the Lord of holiness and proof!Thou hast ever been one God, Single, Eternal, Alone, Ever-Living, Self-Subsisting, Sovereign, Supreme, Holy, Everlasting, Eternal, Self-Dependent, Transcendent, Invincible, Exalted. Thou hast taken neither consort nor son, and Thou hast had no partner in what Thou hast created nor any protector in what Thou hast fashioned. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them by Thine ordering, and by Thy will Thou hast fashioned all things and formed them by Thy forming. Thou dost ever give life and cause death, then cause death and give life, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Just Who wrongeth not, and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the One from Whose grasp escapeth nothing in the heavens or on earth or whatsoever is between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.Praise be to God Who through His exaltation hath risen above all contingent beings \[...\]

In the name of God, the Captive, the Captive!Praise be to God Who hath exalted Himself in His sublimity above all created things, and hath risen in His ascendancy above all existing things, and hath made Himself inaccessible in His inaccessibility above all atoms, and hath manifested His power above all who dwell in the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and hath demonstrated His sovereignty above all created beings, and hath revealed His manifestation above all atoms, and hath shown forth His glory above all things, such that every created thing beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the All-Pervading.He hath chosen an impenetrable Essence, a radiant Abstraction, an exalted Purity, a majestic Camphor-like Nature, and a sublime Form. Then He revealed Himself unto it through it, and through it made Himself inaccessible from it, and cast into its identity the likeness of itself. Thus there appeared from it what was within and upon it, filling thereby the heavens and the earth and all that lieth between them, testifying that there is none other God but Him, and that the One possessed of the Seven Letters is His servant and His Word.God hath chosen for Him primary and essential names, then immersed them in the ocean of timeless eternity, whereby existence was filled, from the kingdom of the unseen to the empire of the visible, testifying that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.The Fourth within the Fourth:Praise be to God, besides Whom there is none other God, the Captive, the Captive. And verily the glory from God be upon the Primal Unity and upon him who resembleth that Unity wherein naught can be seen save the Primal Unity. I testify that there is no path save unto God, exalted be His glory, and that he who taketh the place of the ship and those who possess the means of transport and guide people along both paths - God shall multiply their good deeds two thousand and two degrees above the good deeds of others, for those who bear burdens both on ships and on land tire themselves in the path of God.God hath prescribed for them to deal kindly with those who travel by land and sea with them, that perchance one day they may show kindness to Him Whom God shall make manifest, though they know Him not. And verily this is their greatest deed in the Book of God: that they should watch over themselves lest they change their conduct on the path or speak words that would sadden anyone's heart, and that they should protect people's property as they would protect themselves. For as they nurture themselves in religion and in safeguarding what is entrusted to them, God will surely increase their wealth and honor and whatsoever they desire of their Lord's bounty.God hath chosen from among the bearers of burdens one who hath traveled for God his Lord, and aided the Cause of his Lord on the Day of Resurrection, and protected the Cause of God as was within his power. All draw sustenance from him. God sendeth down upon him His mercy at all times - before and after - and will surely reward him with the most excellent reward ordained in the Book, a goodly and abundant recompense. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Gracious, the Benevolent.Though he may not be known among the well-known of his kind, yet because he hath done good in the path of God, God hath known him and mentioneth him in the Book. Thus from this time until the Day of Resurrection all shall know him. In this way doth God reward the deed of truth and its doer, and God is the best of rewarders.The Twenty-seventh Gate of the Eighth UnityFrom the Eighth Month

In the name of God, the Most Concealed, the Most Concealed! God, there is no God but Him, the Most Concealed, the Most Concealed!Say: God is more concealed than all who possess concealment. None in the heavens or on the earth or between them can resist the dominion of the Sovereign Lord of radiance. He createth whatsoever He willeth through His command. Verily, He hath ever been the Concealer, the All-Concealing, the All-Encompassing.Glorified be He before Whom boweth down in worship whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. Say: All are prostrate before Him.And praise be to God before Whom all within the heavens and earth and whatsoever lieth between them stand in devotion. Say: All are humbly devoted to Him.God testifieth that there is no God but Him. His is the Kingdom and the Dominion, then the Might and the Omnipotence, then the Power and the Divine Realm, then the Strength and the Sovereignty, then the Rule and the Earthly Domain. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life. Verily He is the Ever-Living Who dieth not, the Sovereign Who passeth not away, the Just Who wrongeth not, the Ruler Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on earth or between them. He createth what He willeth by His command. Verily, He hath power over all things.Blessed is He to Whom belongeth the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lieth between them. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved.Exalted is He to Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and on earth and between them. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.Say: Verily God shall roll up the heaven of your religion on the Day of Resurrection even as scrolls are rolled up into an exalted and lofty scroll.That is the Day whereon He Whom God shall make manifest will say: "O people of the Bayan! We created you from a beginning that hath no beginning, sustained you, favored you, and gave you life until the time We made Ourselves known unto you through Our signs, that ye might be among those who prostrate themselves before Us."How is it that ye heard Our verses, yet remained patient? Therefore shall We surely roll up all that ye possess from Us. Verily, We have power over all things."Do ye imagine, O divines of the Bayan, that ye are different from the divines who were given the Psalms? When God revealed the Torah, they remained veiled from God's Book, and God rolled up their religion while they perceived it not and deemed themselves to be virtuous. Or do ye think yourselves different from the divines who were given the Gospel? When God revealed the Qur'an they paid no heed. God rolled them up and all they possessed, yet they perceived it not and deemed themselves virtuous. Or do ye think yourselves different from the divines of the Qur'an? When God revealed the Bayan they paid no heed, and God, their Lord, rolled them up and all they possessed, while they deemed themselves virtuous. This mentioneth your state in numbered Dispensations, but from a beginning that hath no beginning, whenever a Messenger and Book came unto you, that which was revealed before was rolled up, yet ye paid no heed and deemed yourselves virtuous."Therefore have mercy upon your own selves, lest ye be veiled from Him Whom God shall make manifest, for the heaven of your religion shall be rolled up within the grasp of Him Whom God shall make manifest."

The heaven of your religion shall be rolled up in the hand of Him Whom God will make manifest, though ye fancy that ye are doing well. Look not upon yourselves except as ye look upon those divines who were given the Book, that ye may take heed. Then on the Day of Resurrection reflect, and save yourselves thereby, that ye may attain unto the presence of God on the day of His manifestation. This is the presence of Him Whom God will make manifest; verily, We have been yearning for Him. No vision can grasp God, but that which God hath ascribed unto Himself as His presence is like the House that He hath ascribed unto Himself. Verily, we all believe in all things. Say: The letters return to twenty-eight letters, and God hath made each letter a gate, and ye witness the knowledge of every name in their numbers. Thus doth God cause you to begin from knowledge and return you to knowledge. Learn ye therefore the knowledge of truth, naught else but truth, that ye may be saved thereby in every Revelation. Were the divines to believe in God their Lord, all beneath them would believe and be guided. But when they are veiled without proof, they are veiled. Thus doth God return unto the divines of truth the reward of all the letters, if they ponder their religion, and believe in God their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. And He shall return unto the divines who are not of truth all that is ordained in the letters of fire, though in their religion they account themselves God-fearing. But before God and before those possessed of knowledge, because they believe not in Him Whom God will make manifest at the time of His appearance, they are indeed far removed from God's path. God hath created nothing more exalted than knowledge, if ye make your knowledge to be of God your Lord and then act according to His good-pleasure. Verily, on the Day of Resurrection, the aspects of your knowledge will veil you from the essence of knowledge. Be not veiled by your concerns from that for which concerns were created, if ye desire to believe in God and His signs on the Day of Resurrection. Had ye not learned that which profiteth you not - that which profiteth you not of your sciences, your fundamentals, your astronomy, and what ye learn among yourselves - it would not veil you on the Day of Resurrection from believing in God your Lord. Knowledge is but your knowledge of Him Whom God will make manifest, then what appears from Him of command and prohibition. This is all knowledge and wisdom if ye wish to comprehend. This is a Book from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Unto the Primal Point: Verily, there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Announce in the Book a Mahdi, for verily We are the Announcers. O thou! We have created thee and sustained thee and favored thee and given thee life from a beginning that hath no beginning until this moment when We make known to thee Our Self through Our signs and have sent the Messenger there, yet We have not witnessed thee to be among those who remember. When thou didst not hear the Manifestation of God and remained patient without saying "yea," thou wert among those who shall be questioned. And when thou didst see a sign or hear thereof, Our proof was completed against thee just as it was completed against thee in the Qur'an, and verily We have power over all things. We shall surely question thee about thyself and then those who followed thee \[...\]

And verily We were all-powerful over all things. We shall surely question thee about thyself and those who followed thee. If thou hadst aided the Cause of God, We would have witnessed no grief, and We would have made thee the successor of Muhammad-Mihdi, for verily We were powerful over all things. God hath manifested that for which thou didst supplicate throughout thy life for the day of His manifestation, but since thou didst not learn the inner knowledge of the innermost, thou didst not recognize God, thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds. Thou didst not turn to God at the time of His manifestation, though thou didst reckon thyself among the God-fearing. Thou wert exalted through Our names in Islam with a lofty and impregnable glory, yet thou didst not spend from what thou didst possess in Our name in Our path. Therefore perceive thou the Cause of God and be of those who hasten, before death cometh unto thee from God, the Invincible, the Exalted, the Sublime. We created all things for the day of meeting with Us, that thou mightest appear before Us and be among those who prostrate themselves. Yet thou didst remain veiled until what was ordained came to pass. Therefore return unto God, thy Lord, the Most High, the Invincible, the Inaccessible, if thou desirest to be among the guided ones. We have revealed in the Furqan that none other than God can reveal a single verse, that perchance those who were given the Furqan, when they hear one of Our verses, might remember it and be guided thereby. But they occupied themselves with that which profiteth them not and remained veiled from the proof of their religion until the Cause of God came to them while they were sleeping. Behold \[...\] those who were given the Furqan \[...\] they still do not help Him and grieve Him, though they were created to believe in Him and to aid Him. Behold how they grieve the proof of their Lord \[...\] and God will surely question all of them together. And if thou desirest \[...\] We made thee through the means We gave thee from Our presence among the powerful ones \[...\] Thou didst follow in thy life and strive to attain somewhat of God's good-pleasure, and wert among those who prostrated themselves before Us night and day. And hadst thou said concerning Our Cause: "Yea, verily it is the truth and we are believers therein" - had thou said this, it would have been better for thee than all that thou didst throughout thy life, though thou wert among those who worshipped Us night and day. Verily nothing can frustrate Us, nothing in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them, for We are powerful over all things. And nothing escapeth Our knowledge in the heavens or on earth or what lieth between them, for We are knowers of all things. If thou returnest unto God, He will surely change what hath been witnessed against thee in the Book through His grace, for verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Gracious, the Beneficent. And if the matter is concluded, thou shalt find no way unto that. But if thou desirest to be among the guided ones, then follow what hath been revealed in the Book and satisfy those who have believed in God and His verses in that land, for verily We were well-pleased. Then write thou a letter to Him Whom God shall make manifest and request that one of the believers deliver what thou hast written, with God's permission. Perchance God will change the negative into the affirmative, for He is verily the All-Forgiving, the Forgiver, the Second in the Second, the All-Pardoning. In the name of God, the Most Concealed, the Most Concealed. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify before Thee \[...\]

In the Name of God, the Most Hidden, the Most Hidden!I bear witness before Thee, O my God, and before all things, that Thou art God, there is no God but Thee, alone with no partner. Thine is the dominion and the kingdom, Thine the might and the omnipotence, Thine the power and the divinity, Thine the strength and sovereignty, Thine the grandeur and nobility, Thine the countenance and beauty, Thine the direction and perfection, Thine the stations and glory, Thine the power and deeds, Thine the mercy and grace, Thine the majesty and justice, Thine the likeness and examples, Thine the greatness and independence, Thine the grandeur and exaltation, Thine the glory and invincibility, Thine the power and transcendence, Thine the joy and gladness, and Thine is whatsoever Thou lovest in the kingdom of Thy Command and creation.Thou hast ever been, existing before all things, being after all things, essence above all things, and creator beneath all things. Sanctified be Thy names and exalted be Thy examples. Thou hast ever been one God, eternal, single, ever-living, self-subsisting, sovereign, supreme, holy, everlasting, eternal, transcendent, inaccessible, exalted. Thou hast taken no partner unto Thyself, nor is there any associate in what Thou hast created, nor any protector in what Thou hast made. By Thy power Thou hast created all things and ordained them with precise ordainment, and by Thy will Thou hast fashioned all things and formed them with perfect formation.O God! Do Thou assist the dwellers of the Paradise of the Bayan, and remove, O Lord, whatsoever Thou hast not caused to enter into that Paradise. Thou dost ever quicken and cause to die, then cause to die and quicken, and verily Thou art the Ever-Living Who dieth not, and the King Who passeth not away, and the Justice that \[...\] and the Sovereign Who changeth not, and the Single One from Whose grasp nothing escapeth, whether in the heavens or on the earth or between them. Thou createst what Thou willest by Thy command. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.\[Translation continues with subsequent sections, but sample ends here to stay within length constraints\]

God hath chosen for His Word essential and eternal names, then hath immersed them in the ocean of eternal infinity, whereupon existence hath been filled therewith, \[the unseen\] kingdom and then the realm of visible testimony, for verily there is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Fourth in the Fourth, the Self-Subsisting. In the name of God, the Most Concealed, the Most Concealed! All praise be to God, beside Whom there is no other God, the Most Concealed, the Most Concealed. And verily the Glory from God be upon the First One and upon whomsoever resembleth that One, wherein naught can be seen except the First One. And furthermore, I testify that there is no Concealer save God, exalted be His glory, and no Revealer except Him, mighty be His might. Verily God in His Essence hath never directly engaged in any act, and that which is concealed by Him Whom God shall make manifest is that which God hath attributed to Himself, that it be written on paper, yea, and that He conceal it. This is the recompense of the entire Bayan from God, and it sufficeth them. They should take pride in what God their Lord hath accepted from them. And should He write "Nay," then verily all that they possess in their religion hath been concealed, if ye would but briefly remember, then reflect. And if the heaven of the Bayan be concealed within the self of anyone after the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest and the elevation of that which He revealeth, then verily thy very essence doth herald that Name, and thou must needs be adorned with that attribute, for on the Day of Resurrection it shall be more profitable unto thee than all attributes. Verily the heavens of hearts, spirits, souls and bodies have returned through that which was revealed in the Bayan, and it behooveth the wise and discerning one to conceal them through his wisdom, as a grace from His presence - verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Subtle. Therefore hasten in this during the days of Him Whom God shall make manifest, for that is better for thee in the sight of God than all thy deeds, if thou be among those who are endowed with insight when the heaven of religion is concealed by God's leave therein.

<p>=== START BH00068 ===</p>
<p>He is the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>His is the grace and bounty, His the loving-kindness and bestowal. He giveth and withholdeth, and verily He is the All-Powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of ’Akka: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Most Loving.</p>
<p>We have sent down unto thee that which hath brought solace to the eyes of the Concourse on High, and We have wafted unto thee the fragrance of the All-Merciful from this sacred and mighty, this beloved Paradise. Thy letter which thou didst send unto Our Most Great Branch hath come before the Wronged One, and he presented it before Our countenance. We have answered thee through this Tablet, the forbidden one, which causeth the limbs of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, to quake. We have mentioned thee in such wise as shall never perish, enduring as long as the dominion of earth and heaven endureth. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for He hath aided thee and distinguished thee and honored thee with that which most of His servants have been denied. He Who speaketh in every state beareth witness to this: There is none other God but Me, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>Make mention of My people on My behalf and remind them of My verses which have been sent down from the heaven of My Will, and acquaint them with My straight and extended path. Say: O people of God! This is the Day which hath adorned the Books of God, both former and latter, as attested by honored servants. Cast aside this day whatsoever the people possess, holding fast unto that which God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, hath. Beware lest the doubts of the world or the intimations of them that have disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed hold you back. Arise to promote the Cause by God’s command and His sovereignty in such wise that neither the opposition of the divines nor the might of kings shall frighten you. Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and through such conduct as shall tranquilize hearts and minds.</p>
<p>We have commanded all with that which profiteth them and counseled them at the outset of the Book to fear God, the Lord of the Promised Day. O people of God! Aid your Lord through deeds and conduct and through fear of God. This is better for you, did ye but know. By My life! The sword of piety is sharper than blades of steel, were ye to understand. We have forbidden all from disputation and contention, and commanded them to observe what is seemly. He hath enjoined upon His servants that which draweth them nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>O people of God! Know ye the value of these days and that which hath been manifested therein. By the True One! The Throne of Revelation hath been established upon the most exalted spot in the world, and upon it hath sat He Who conversed upon Sinai, proclaiming: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of all existence. Beware lest the might of the world weaken you, or the ranks and legions prevent you. Be ye the banners of guidance unto all creation and the ensigns of triumph amidst humanity. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur whilst in the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the deniers have wrought, they who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the elevated Throne.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Fear ye God, the Lord of all mankind. He hath come for your salvation, as attested by that which is with Him - the Preserved Tablet. Ye have forbidden the servants from the river of mercy and have committed that which hath caused the denizens of Paradise to lament at eventide and at dawn, at dusk and at morn. O mystics! Fear ye God and follow not your idle fancies. Follow ye Him Who hath come from the Dayspring of the Cause with verses that all the treasures of earth cannot equal, did ye but know. Verily, Reality hath appeared through His command and circleth round Him, and the Law is that which ye behold before your faces, and the Path is this way, would ye but comprehend. This is the Day wherein the Straight Path hath appeared and the Balance hath been set up. He calleth out with the most exalted voice between earth and heaven, yet most of the people hear not. Verily, Reality circleth round Him, and the Path hath appeared through His command, and the Balance hath been set up by His sovereignty, yet most of the people perceive not.</p>
<p>O Jamal! Hear once again the call from the crimson Tree raised upon the white land beyond ’Amman–the grace of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I have appeared and manifested My Cause, and have sent down that which hath stirred the kingdom of utterance. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain imaginings and clung to the cord of certitude. Say: Today that which the people possess shall profit them not. Fear God, and follow not those who have changed God’s favor into their own desires and denied Him when He came with manifest sovereignty. We created the learned ones, the mystics and the divines for the recognition of Him Who is known and knowable, yet they turned away from Him when He came with His all-compelling verses to those who are in the heavens and on earth. They cast behind them God’s covenant and His testament, and pronounced judgment against those who lamented His separation. Thus did their souls prompt them. Bear thou witness that they are accounted among the most lost in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory. Be thou vocal in My remembrance, steadfast in My Cause, soaring in the atmosphere of My love, turning unto the lights of My countenance, clinging to the hem of My mercy, and standing firm in the service of My Most Great Cause and My Mighty Message. We chose thee aforetime for the service of My mighty and wondrous Cause, guided thee to My straight and manifest path, and assisted thee until thou didst traverse land and sea, turning toward the Most Sublime Horizon, until thou didst enter and attain presence and didst hear and see this manifest horizon. Blessed be thine eye for what it hath beheld, thine ear for what it hath heard, thy tongue for what it hath uttered, thy heart for what it hath turned unto, and thy face for what it hath turned toward the Face of God, the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding thy migration toward the land of M, We were with thee and heard thy call in this manifest Cause. We beseech God to assist the people of M with the hosts of the unseen and the visible, and with companies of angels drawn nigh. Nothing whatsoever escapeth thy Lord’s knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones in T and its surroundings, that the utterance of the All-Merciful may attract them to a station wherein nothing whatsoever shall prevent them from turning toward God, the Lord of all names and Creator of heaven. Verily, thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Say: O peoples of the earth! Turn with illumined hearts to the horizon from which shineth the Day-Star of thy Lord’s loving providence, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Object not to that which hath appeared from God. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Blessed is he who hath pondered this most exalted Word and clung to it, despite those who are moved by every wind and who speak what their desires command them. They are assuredly among the wrongdoers. Thus hath the Book revealed its verses, the ocean its waves, and the Revelation its mysteries. Blessed is he who hath heard and acted; woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>We have caused thee to hear Our verses in a clear Arabic tongue, and We desire to cause thee to hear them in an eloquent Persian language. Both before and after, the letters of that honored one and the petitions which were sent have attained unto hearing, and the answer hath been revealed and sent from the Lord of all beings. O My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Hearts have been veiled by barriers, ears have been defiled by the words of the polytheists, and eyes have been withheld by veils. Beseech thou God, exalted be His glory, that He deprive not His servants of the Most Great Ocean and withhold them not from the lights of the Day-Star of true Divine unity. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the Land of Mim, We have hearkened thereunto. We beseech God to aid all to that which will exalt the Word of God and to transform doubts and idle fancies into certitude and faith. This Day is unlike all other days. Blessed is the soul that hath inhaled the fragrances of revelation and hath hastened with heart and soul to the Most Exalted Horizon. The Ancient Pen hath not ceased, and the Lord of the Most Great Name hath called out at all times. The path is clear, the Cause manifest, the light evident, and the verses revealed, the signs apparent. Yet the people of the world remain debarred and veiled. The world was created and brought forth from nothingness for this blessed Day, and that which no eye hath ever beheld hath been made manifest. Every person of insight beareth witness to what hath been mentioned, and every informed one testifieth and is aware. Yet the people remain heedless. We beseech God to aid them to turn towards Him, to draw them nigh unto Him, and to purify them from that which beseemeth not His party. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the upheavals in that land and certain matters, all is evident and manifest before God. The people are heedless and bereft of the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, willeth. By My life! Nothing is hidden from My knowledge. The Supreme Paradise, the Most Exalted Garden, the Concourse on High, and this Pen which moveth at this moment with a speed which none can reckon save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, all bear witness to this. In the Tablets We have enjoined wisdom upon all, and that which exalteth souls hath been revealed and sent down from the Most Exalted Pen. Well is it with them that have attained and acted accordingly.</p>
<p>Last year one of the friends of God, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, prevented someone from attaining Our presence. We testify that he hath turned to the Most Luminous Countenance, hath drawn nigh unto God, hath entered the Most Great Prison, hath heard My sweetest call and beheld My most exalted horizon. Blessed is he and whoso is with him. After his presence and standing before the Countenance, We made mention of thee, and especially for some of the loved ones of the Land of Mim wondrous and sublime Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the divine Will and sent forth. Among them were two Tablets specifically revealed from the heaven of favor for the Siyyids, that they might drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful and arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as would remain unaltered by the conditions of the world and the vicissitudes of nations, that they might be illumined by the light of the Luminary of Revelation and occupy themselves with that which beseemeth His praise and glorification. Likewise for others, that all might attain and drink from the ocean of inner meanings which lie concealed in the utterance of the Goal of all the worlds. O My Name! If they truly attain thereunto and receive their portion from the oceans of bounty hidden within the verses, they will unite the outward and the inward and will arise to champion the Cause of the Wronged One with such steadfastness as the might of the world cannot disturb nor the power of nations prevent. Those Tablets testify to the grace, loving-kindness, compassion and mercy of God, exalted be His glory. Beseech ye God that He may enable the souls to preserve that which hath been bestowed. God, exalted be His glory, is generous and His bounty all-embracing.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in the land of Mim! Hearken with your inner ears to the Voice of the Wronged One. Your mention hath proceeded from the Most Exalted Pen, both before and after. Blessed is the eye that hath not been hindered by the veils of idle fancies from beholding, and the ear that hath not been deprived by the utterances of the peoples of the world from hearing the Word of God, and the heart that hath not been withheld by the ornaments of the world from turning towards Him. The aforementioned Tablets have arrived and continue to arrive through the grace and bounty of God, exalted be His glory. O My Name! Every breath that is drawn for the sake of God hath attained the Most Exalted Horizon and is honored at the Summit of Glory. Pure deeds transcend the heavens. No matter hath been or is hidden. Doubt hath no passage here, uncertainty no place. The horizon of manifestation is illumined with the lights of knowledge and certitude. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto them that turn away! Should anyone observe with the eye of fairness the verses, suras, and tablets that have been revealed and are manifest, he would throughout his life testify that with Him is the knowledge of all things. Blessed are they who hold fast to the cord of the word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth.” For them there hath been and is no peril, for they bear witness to the truth of whatsoever proceedeth from God, even were He to decree for the earth the law of heaven or for heaven the law of earth. Thus hath spoken My Herald, Whom We sent to announce unto the people this Most Great, Most Ancient, All-Knowing, All-Informed Revelation. Gird up the loins of endeavor, and with spirit and joy and with forbearance and kindliness, summon the people to the Truth. Today from the divine verses floweth the water of life, and it is the breath of the All-Merciful throughout all creation. With it, give life to the dead and refresh the withered ones. Protect the planted saplings from the poisonous winds of malicious souls. These are the winds of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Beseech God to protect His servants and enable them to attain that which He hath purposed for them. Verily He hath power over all things. Nothing can frustrate Him, no power can weaken Him, and no cause can frighten Him. He speaketh before all faces even as He spoke in the beginning of days: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Speaker, the Manifest, the Hearer, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>
<p>O My Name! You made mention of Mulla Muhammad. We make mention of him as a token of Our grace - verily your Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Strong, the Mighty. O Muhammad! Hear the Call from the Sacred Tree planted in the luminous earth. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. He hath appeared and revealed what He desired by His command, and He is the Omnipotent over what was and what shall be. The tyrants of the world and the pharaohs of the nations have not weakened Him. He doeth what He willeth by His command, and He is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have heard thy call and make mention of thee in this perspicuous Book, and We counsel thee with that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken and with which We have commanded the servants in My Great Tablet. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the doubts of those who have exchanged the grace of God for unbelief shall not hinder thee, and who have committed that which hath caused the tears to flow from the eyes of the Messengers. O Muhammad! Strive that thou mayest attain unto that which beseemeth these days of God, exalted be His glory. In the nights and days the Pen of the Lord of all beings hath moved, and from it hath flowed that which the eye of the world hath never seen. Praise be to the Goal of all existence Who hath guided thee and shown thee the way. Preserve this most exalted station through His Name. The divines of the earth are occupied with vain imaginings and are deprived of the lights of the Most Great Luminary. The mystics too have clung to idle fancies and have ever been followers of their desires. They have held fast to certain words that neither nourish nor profit, and have deprived the hapless people from the Most Great Ocean. The paths of vain imaginings are many, as ye have surely heard. Say: O people of God! Cast aside what the people possess and take what is with God, the Lord of the worlds. The light of truth hath ever shone from the horizon of the Word of God, but the people understand not. Nay rather, truth circleth round His Most Exalted Pen, to which every discerning soul beareth witness. We send greetings to the loved ones in that land and bid them to steadfastness. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>O My Name! Give him the glad-tidings from Me and remind him of My verses that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones, and that he may speak in praise of his Lord amongst the servants. And I am the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst mention about Mirza Muhammad, son of him who ascended unto God - upon them both be My glory and loving-kindness - We have revealed for him that which will solace his eyes and gladden his heart. The gaze of Our loving-kindness hath ever been directed towards that household. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist them and grant them success in His remembrance and praise, and to confirm them in steadfastness in His firm and mighty Cause. Their tablets will be sent. Give them glad-tidings from the True One. Verily He maketh mention of His loved ones in such wise that their remembrance shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Mention was made in thy letter of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be My glory. We have mentioned him before and make mention of him at this time.</p>
<p>In My Name, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Hear the call of the Wronged One. Verily He maketh mention of thee while He was in the hands of the heedless. We have revealed the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet most of the people are among the heedless. They have forsaken their God, clinging to their desires. Lo! They are among the most lost. When the rapture of the All-Merciful’s utterance taketh hold of thee, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink from the fountain of Thy knowledge and for having caused me to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon when most of mankind turned away from Thee, and for having made me hear Thy call and shown me Thy signs. I beseech Thee by the penetrating power of Thy most exalted Word and the potency of Thy Cause, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, by the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing and the voice of Thy Most Exalted Pen, to make me attracted to Thy verses, enkindled with the fire of Thy Lote-Tree, holding fast to Thy cord, and clinging to Thy robe in such wise that the hosts of the world shall not prevent me nor the clamor of the nations frighten me. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and standing ready to serve Thee. Assist me through Thy bounty and favor, then ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of this world and the world to come. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath ascended unto God, who believed in God, the One, the All-Informed. We were with him when he ascended to the Most Exalted Companion. We caused him to enter a station which none hath known save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, after We forgave him and purified him as a bounty from Us. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O My Name! We have mentioned every name that was in thy letter. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Sovereign of the Kingdom of bounty, and glory be unto Thee, O Glory of the worlds, for having strengthened me, exalted me, and distinguished me for the service of Thy Cause among Thy servants, and made me one of those who are nigh unto Thee. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Verily, My Most Exalted Pen desireth to make mention of him who was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin, who turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, holding fast to the cord of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. O My Most Exalted Pen! Say: The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee, O thou who didst turn and ascend unto the Most Exalted Companion. I testify that thou didst hear the Call and didst turn unto God, the Lord of all being. We beseech God, exalted be He, to forgive thee as a bounty from His presence, to rain down upon thee the showers of mercy and forgiveness, to cause thee to dwell in the highest paradise, and to make thee a companion of His Prophets and Messengers. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We console those whom God hath related unto him as a bounty from Us, and We make mention of them in such wise as to aid them in remembrance and praise in the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O My Name! If the True One, exalted be His glory, were to act with justice and judge according to what is with Him in the presence of knowledge, matters would become exceedingly difficult and arduous. However, these are the days of Manifestation, and His grace hath encompassed all and His mercy hath preceded all. At the time when the Ancient Beauty was established upon the Most Great Throne, He uttered three words, one of which is that every name that is mentioned before His presence or is made present shall attain unto the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty. Thou didst mention ’Ali-’Askar, upon him be My glory. Verily, We love him. We have mentioned him and We make mention of him. Make mention of him by My command, remind him of My verses, give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy, and illumine him with the lights of My wondrous utterance. We have accepted from him what he hath done in Our path. Verily, his Lord is the Generous, the Possessor of great bounty. Glorify him on behalf of the Wronged One. We testify that he turned unto God and believed in Him when every remote scholar and every doubtful mystic turned away from Him.</p>
<p>O He who is named by Me! The All-Bountiful - upon him be My glory - hath sent thy letter and We have heard thy call unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth, the Lord of the hereafter and of former times, and the Lord of this mighty station. We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee time and again. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my Lord and my King, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O my heart’s Desire and my Adored One, and glory be unto Thee, O Ultimate Goal of the hopes of those in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>That which hath streamed from the Most Exalted Pen is without likeness or equal - equivalent to the divine Books of the past and future, nay rather surpassing them. Ask thou of God that all that hath been revealed may be gathered together and may educate His servants, that all may find it and attain unto true rest.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about thy brother Shaykh ’Abbas - upon them both be My glory - mention of him hath reached the court of Our hearing. Convey unto him mention from the Wronged One and send him greetings and glad-tidings. For nearly a year in this land, the fire of hatred hath blazed in the hearts of some opposers, despite Our having treated the people of this realm with utmost love and kindness from the earliest days until now. They have denied Our bounty and rejected Our grace. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they remain today unaware and uncomprehending. Nevertheless, We grant leave to the aforementioned one to come, that he may rejoice and be among those who praise God. Let him set forth and keep his gaze fixed upon God. Thus have We illumined the tablet of his mention with the light of Our permission, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the sick person - it hath reached the hearing of the Lord of Names. Excellent is what thou hast done. We beseech God to aid thee to do good, even as He hath strengthened thee and chosen thee to serve His Cause, the Firm, the Strong. The friends of God must assist one another in such matters that arise and consider themselves partners in both hardship and ease. Verily He commandeth His servants to righteousness and piety, even as He hath commanded them before in various tablets. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth! Woe unto every heedless and remote one!</p>
<p>Let those who have sought or who seek healing from the ocean of divine favor recite these exalted words which have shone forth from the Dayspring of grace:</p>
<p>“O my God, my God! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy healing, and by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy grace, and by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue Thy servants, and by the penetrating power of Thy most exalted Word and Thy most august Pen, and by Thy mercy that hath preceded the creation of all who are in heaven and on earth, to purify me with the waters of Thy bounty from every affliction and disorder, and from all weakness and feebleness. Thou seest, O my Lord, Thy suppliant waiting at the door of Thy bounty, and him who hath placed his hopes in Thee clinging to the cord of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee not to deny him the things he seeketh from the ocean of Thy grace and the Day-Star of Thy loving-kindness. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. There is none other God save Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>O Jamal! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High! Previously from the Most Exalted Pen flowed this passage: In the destined end, the Beloved is submission and contentment. Observe the lamp: as long as oil and wick remain, it can be protected from tempestuous winds and other conditions. At this station, whoever recites what hath been mentioned will assuredly be preserved and attain healing. This is the suspended destiny that hath been mentioned among the servants, both before and after. However, when the oil and wick are depleted, implements and tools yield no fruit, nor will they ever do so. This is the station of destined end. Although God, exalted be His glory, is capable of changing it, yet another harm would appear. Therefore, if one attains this station with joy and fragrance, with trust and submission, by the life of God, he will be accounted among the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and will abide in that supreme station. Were the Most Exalted Pen to elaborate on these stations in detail, all would, before their end, hasten toward the ultimate goal and the loftiest summit. Most know not what is best for them. Jesus, son of Mary, saith: “Thou knowest what is in my soul, and I know not what is in Thy Soul. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Thus hath shone forth the Sun of grace as a token unto thee. Observe, then hear, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth!”</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Mahdi from Jasb. We heard thy mention, have mentioned him, and bid him to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of all beings, and We give him glad tidings of the grace of his Gracious Lord. Convey greetings from the Wronged One and say: The Wronged One hath turned toward thee from the Most Great Prison and maketh mention of thee, that His mention may perchance draw thee nigh unto a station where neither the shoes of every barking dog, nor the doubts of any learned one, nor the fancy of any mystic, nor the conjecture of any divine, nor the oppression of the aggressors will affect thee. Say: Know thou the station of this Most Great Remembrance which the Lord of Eternity hath sent down in His Great Prison.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Hakim Sulayman. O Jamal! Praise be to God, the children of the Friend and the heirs of Him Who conversed with God have, in most cities and lands, turned to the supreme horizon and have drunk of the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting. However, the Shi’ih faction is still observed in manifest unbelief. This is what We promised aforetime and revealed unto Muhammad, the Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets: “We desire to show favor unto those who were brought low in the land, and to make them leaders and to make them the inheritors.” O Sulayman! The All-Merciful hath come with manifest sovereignty. We beseech God to aid thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest, before all faces, take from the hand of the bounty of the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen the sealed wine and drink it in His Name. Today, He Who conversed with God uttereth this word: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for having shown me and honored me with that which Thou didst withhold from me before. I testify that Thou art the Ancient Bestower. And thanks be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in the kingdom of Command and Creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Nazim-ul-Ulama. We have turned unto him from this Station and have remembered him with that which attracteth the hearts, the minds, the souls, and the intellects. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth thee from the precincts of the Prison and remindeth thee of the verses of God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting. By God! The Day of hearkening hath come, for the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen hath been raised between earth and heaven, and the Day of witnessing hath come, for the Most Great Luminary hath shone forth from the horizon of the world and summoneth all to the praiseworthy station. Beware lest anything whatsoever in the days of thy Lord, the Possessor of Names, prevent thee from arising to serve His Cause. Know thou the value of these days. We beseech God to assist thee under all conditions and draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be,” and it is. That which thou beholdest today shall perish, and there shall endure for thee that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the will of thy Lord, the Possessor of existence. Verily, My name Jamal, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness, hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee in this irrevocable Tablet that thou mayest drink of My choice sealed wine through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and arise to aid thy Lord, the Possessor of the seen and the unseen. Thus hath the Sun manifested its splendor and its lights, and the sea its waves, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. When the Kawthar of My utterance hath taken hold of thee and drawn thee nigh unto the horizon of My loving-kindness, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me in days wherein the divines and theologians of the earth have turned away from Thy most exalted horizon. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and the manifestations of Thy power, O Lord of all being, to strengthen me in Thy remembrance and praise, and in acting according to that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book, and in arising to serve Thy Cause amongst Thy servants in such wise that the doubts of the transgressors, the signs of the objectors, and the might of the heedless shall not withhold me. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of that which beseemeth the ocean of Thy grace, the heaven of Thy bounty, and the sun of Thy generosity. Then cause me, O my God, to be steadfast in Thy Cause whereby the feet of Thy servants have slipped. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, and worthy of answering prayer.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning turning towards various regions, these matters are contingent upon consultation, and as this matter hath repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, it must in every case be firmly adhered to. Verily, He is thy Helper and will assist thee. Thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And as for thy mention of Abd S., praise be to God, he hath attained and drunk from the cup of loving-kindness. His eyes, ears, and tongue have attained to that for which they were brought from nothingness into being. It behooveth him to praise and thank God throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. Special Tablets were previously sent, and God willing, they will attain unto them.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Abu’l-Hasan of Hamadan. We verily made mention of him before his acceptance, guided him to Our path, and caused him to hear Our call. We beseech God to ordain for him that which will draw him nigh unto Him in every world of His worlds. He, verily, hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention Mirza Siyyid ’Ali. We have sent down for him that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s gracious favor. We make mention of him at this hour through My manifest command. Give him glad-tidings from Me, remind him of My verses, and illumine him through My Name, at which the limbs of the idolaters have quaked.</p>
<p>O Jamal! Today is the day of service and the day of assistance, and assistance is through the teaching of the Cause. This blessed verse was revealed from the heaven of divine will in the Tablet of Wisdom. We addressed the Most Great Nabil thus: “Be thou as the throbbing artery in the body of creation,” and in another passage: “Walk with the power of the Most Great Name above the world that thou mayest become aware of that which no one hath become aware.”</p>
<p>O My Name! Upon thee be My glory! Assistance hath ever been through the fear of God and through the hosts of goodly deeds and character, and through the teaching of the Cause. All must strive and arise as behooveth them. Praise be to God that strife, contention and corruption are all forbidden. Beseech thou the Truth that He may purify the earth from matters that are not pleasing and sanctify the hearts, that all may discover and become aware, and hearken with their inner ear to the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, and behold with their outer and inner eyes the penetrating power of the Most Sublime Word. Verily thy Lord is the All-Informed, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the Most Generous, the Helper.</p>
<p>We counsel all to observe wisdom, for the people are weak and the divines have made the Cause dubious in the eyes of both government and nation. They have called the reformer a mischief-maker and named the quickener a destroyer. By the life of God! Were there found the least measure of fairness, the mere arising of this Wronged One before the faces of all men, without any veil or covering, would be a proof unto all. However, the intoxication of wealth and pride hath prevented the people from the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss, and shall behold My loved ones in manifest gain.</p>
<p>Gatherings in the Land of Ta are not approved. For some who arrive there, it would be more in keeping with piety if they would depart soon. He verily knoweth and seeth what is with His loved ones, though they know not what is with Him. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write regarding the ill person and his passing, blessed is he. Verily, We have mentioned him with a mention that hath purified him from his transgressions and mistakes, and caused him to enter an exalted station, as a mercy from God, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful, and as a favor from Him - and He is the Most Generous of the generous ones. Concerning their having sent him to the hospital upon consultation with others, there is no harm in this. If that place is well-organized and there is no negligence in caring for the patient, it is acceptable. In these regions, in every city this practice is current and widespread. That which We have revealed in the Book hath come to pass, and what remaineth of it shall soon be made manifest. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>As for the handmaidens whom thou didst mention, each hath been honored with Our mention. We beseech God to assist all to that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to bestow upon them that which endureth and lasteth. Verily, He hath power over all things. Make mention of each one on behalf of the Wronged One and give them glad tidings. Say: Today the ocean of bounty is surging and the sun of generosity is shining from the horizon of the world. He ordaineth that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Be thankful unto your Lord, for verily He is with His accepted servants and handmaidens, and He desireth for none save that which shall elevate their station with God, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>The mention of those souls who, out of love for God, accompanied that stranger’s funeral hath in this moment flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Verily We give thanks for My bounty and My favor, and We make mention of My mercy that hath preceded all and My power that hath encompassed existence.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-’Askar! This is yet another time thou hast been honored with the mention of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Verily We have mentioned thee with verses that surpass the riches of kings and sovereigns.</p>
<p>O Shir-’Ali! Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and for having shown me Thy clear and straight path. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity to aid me to be steadfast in Thy Most Great Cause and Thy Momentous News.</p>
<p>O ?abibu’llah! Thou art he who hath heard the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen and hath beheld My Most Glorious Horizon and hath attained the presence before My face, and hast been blessed with the bounties of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Preserve this most exalted station and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Goal of the mystics, for having enabled me to fulfill that for which Thou didst create me. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother who saw and believed and said: “I believe in Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>Verily he who was named Buzurg hath attained unto My favor time and again, and We have mentioned him in diverse Tablets which We have revealed from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen, whereby the eyes of those near unto God were solaced and the hearts of the sincere ones were attracted. He must give thanks unto his Lord for having assisted and honored him, and revealed for him that which the tongues of all who make mention have failed to describe.</p>
<p>O Mirza! Hear the call from the precincts of the Prison. Verily there is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He seeth the turning of His loved ones unto Him and heareth their cry and mentioneth them through His all-encompassing grace.</p>
<p>O son of ’A??ar! Upon thee and upon thy father be My glory and My favor. Verily We counsel thee to unity and harmony. By My life, through these two the horizons are illumined. We have mentioned thee in these days time and again and have adorned thee with the ornament of the favor of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Verily My name Jamal, upon him be My glory and My favor - We have mentioned thee and have remembered thee again, and before him My name Mahdi, upon him be My glory. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the Answering One. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this mighty favor.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! We have mentioned thee and do mention thee at this time as a favor from One mighty and all-knowing. Verily We counsel thee and those who have believed to unity and to that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be exalted.</p>
<p>O Jamal! We glorify in this hour ’Ali-Qabli-Haydar who hath arisen to serve the Cause. Make mention of him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the light of the Sun of My bounty. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. We beseech God to assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to enable him to serve His mighty Cause. In all conditions, hold fast unto wisdom, for the heedless consider reward and recompense to lie in persecuting the believers in divine unity, even as the Quraysh and the people of Ba??a inflicted upon the Seal of the Prophets that which the Pen is powerless to recount. And whatsoever they inflicted, they deemed it a means of drawing near to the manifestations of vain imaginings and the temples of idols. Ask thou of God to open wide the gates of justice and preserve the sun of equity from the clouds of vain imaginings, that haply His servants may see and find, and be freed and delivered from the smoke and dust of idle fancies. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful, and He is the Counsellor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>If thou meetest His honor ’A.B., upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, convey unto him mention and glorification from the Wronged One, and give him the glad-tidings of God’s bounty. Say: O ye who are sincere, honor ye his dwelling-place. This is a command from the presence of the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of the daughter of him who attained Our presence and won the victory. We make mention of her with a clear remembrance, and We remember her mother who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We have forgiven her as a mercy from Our presence, for We are the Forgiver, the Merciful. At this hour We have sent that which will comfort her heart. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>The letter written in the hand of one of the loved ones, sent on behalf of Sadat, upon them both be My glory, wherein mention was made of the friends in the lands of Sh. and S., was presented before the Face and attained the honor of being heard. All the souls mentioned therein have attained unto divine bounty.</p>
<p>O My Name Jamal! We have remembered them and do remember them. Verily thy Lord is the Rememberer, the All-Knowing. O My loved ones! Hear ye My call from the direction of My prison. He remembereth you with that whereby your names shall endure, as attesteth the Mother Book in its exalted station. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld My most elevated horizon, and the ear that hath heard the scratching of My Pen, and the heart that hath turned unto My mighty and unshakeable Cause. That which ye behold today shall perish, but there shall endure for you that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, for this great bounty.</p>
<p>We counsel you as We have counseled Our servants aforetime, to manifest spiritual qualities and goodly deeds, and the fear of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who hath rent asunder the veils of idle fancies and the curtains of vain imaginings, and hath turned wholly unto the All-Informed One. Cast away that which the people possess. Verily the Self-Subsisting hath arisen with the Cause and calleth you unto that which shall profit you in every world of the worlds of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, as every discerning soul doth testify.</p>
<p>Hold ye fast unto the cord of your Lord’s loving-kindness in such wise that the doubts of the world and the idle fancies of the nations shall not keep you back. Then recognize ye the station of these days and their rank. By the life of God! The sun hath never risen upon their like. We have remembered you before and do remember you at this hour, and We remind you of that which beseemeth this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day.</p>
<p>When ye find the fragrance of My utterance and are attracted by My verses, say: O our Lord, our Master, our Worshipped One and our Heart’s Desire! Praise be unto Thee for having guided us unto the Salsabil of Thy knowledge and the Euphrates of Thy mercy. We beseech Thee by the Sovereign of Names and by Thy Cause that dominateth all things, to assist us to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall prevent us. Verily Thou art the Lord of Names and the Creator of heaven. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Jamal! We make mention of the party of God in the Land of Ta and other lands, and give them glad tidings through God’s loving-kindness. By the Sun of proof which now speaks: whosoever has turned with a pure heart and radiant countenance toward the supreme horizon - in that very moment their mention has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and they have attained the divine tokens. Give thou glad tidings unto all and remind them. Some souls are mentioned before the Throne; due to wisdom their names are not revealed. Verily thy Lord speaks the truth and guides the way. Some turned with utmost love, while others arose to serve during the days and nights, and yet another group held fast without any pause. All are mentioned and have attained immeasurable favors. Soon will God manifest what He has ordained for them, and they shall find themselves in evident joy and mighty gladness. The Glory shining from the horizon of My heavenly Kingdom be upon thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever has prevented from turning unto God, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven, who broke not God’s Covenant and His Testament, and who were steadfast in His manifest Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Answer: If he has heard the commandment of the Most Holy Book and disregarded it, his wife should wait a full year, after which she is free either to adopt that which is praiseworthy or take another husband. And if the person has not heard the commandment, she should have patience until tidings of him reach her. By ‘praiseworthy’ in this connection is meant patience.</p>
<p>Question concerning the blessed verse “When We heard the cries of the children in the loins, We doubled their share and decreased from the others.” Answer: The inheritance in the Divine Book is divided into 2520 shares, which number encompasses all possible fractions of nine. These shares are then allocated to seven categories of heirs as mentioned in the Book. For example, the children are designated sixty-nine units, which is the number of the word “Muqt.” The meaning of “We doubled their share” is that an equal amount was added, making two times sixty-nine. What was added was deducted from the others. For instance, it was revealed “And for the wives is a share from the Book of Ha equivalent to the number of Ta and Fa,” meaning that wives were allotted eight times sixty, which is the number of Ta and Fa. Now ninety (sixty plus half of sixty) was deducted from the wives’ portion and added to the children’s share, and so forth, until the total deducted amount equaled nine times sixty, which was added to the original nine times sixty.</p>
<p>Question concerning inheritance of brothers - whether a brother from both parents inherits, or if one from either parent inherits. Answer: If the brother is from the father’s side, his share is as mentioned in the Book. If from the mother’s side, one-third of his share reverts to the House of Justice and two-thirds to him. The same applies for the sister.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding inheritance, it is decreed that if there are no offspring, their share reverts to the House of Justice. When other categories are absent, such as father, mother, brother, sister or teacher, do their shares also revert to the House of Justice, or is it otherwise? […]</p>
<p>The blessed verse suffices, as He, exalted be He, says: “If one dies without offspring, their rights revert to the House of Justice, etc. And for one who has offspring but none of the other heirs specified in the Book, two-thirds of what they leave goes to the offspring and one-third to the House of Justice, etc.” This means if someone dies without offspring, the rights of offspring revert to the House of Justice. And if there are offspring but no other heirs, two-thirds of the inheritance goes to the offspring and the remaining third reverts to the House of Justice. This ruling applies both in whole and in part - meaning whichever of the other heirs are absent, two-thirds goes to the offspring and one-third to the House of Justice.</p>
<p>Question about the amount subject to Huququ’llah: The amount subject to Huququ’llah is nineteen mithqals of gold - meaning after money reaches this amount, Huquq applies. As for other properties, after they reach this value, not number, Huququ’llah applies only once. For example, if someone owns one thousand mithqals of gold and pays its Huquq, no further Huququ’llah applies to that property except on what is added through trade, transactions and other means when it reaches the prescribed amount - that is, on the profits derived from it. In this case, one must act according to what God has decreed, unless the original property transfers to another’s possession, then Huquq applies as it did the first time. The Primal Point states that Huququ’llah must be paid on the value of all things owned, but in this Most Great Revelation, We have exempted household furnishings and residence - that is, items that are necessities.</p>
<p>Question about Huququ’llah, debts of the deceased, and funeral expenses - which takes precedence: Funeral expenses take precedence, then payment of debts, then collection of Huququ’llah.

<p>Question about the prohibition of shaving the head in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and its command in the Surih of Pilgrimage: All are bound by the Kitab-i-Aqdas - what is revealed therein is God’s law among His servants. Shaving the head has been exempted for those intending pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Question about marriage during the year of patience: If intimacy occurs during the year of patience, the marriage law applies and one must act according to the Book. If the year of patience ends and what God has decreed takes place, no waiting period is required. Union between man and woman during the year of patience is forbidden, and if one commits this, they must seek forgiveness and pay nineteen mithqals of gold to the House of Justice as a penalty.</p>
<p>Question about divorce without waiting period after reciting the verses and giving the dowry if aversion occurs: […]</p>

<p>QUESTION: Concerning lost property and how to handle it when found.</p>
<p>ANSWER: If found in the city, it should be announced once. If the owner is found, it should be given to him. Otherwise, wait one year.

If the lost item is worth less than or equal to the cost of announcement, wait one day after finding it; if the owner is not found, the finder may keep it. If found in the countryside, wait three days; if the owner is not found, the finder may keep it.</p>

Otherwise, count from the day of departure until the completion of one year, according to the conditions revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.</p>

<p>Question about inheritance. Answer: Regarding inheritance, what the Primal Point - may our souls be sacrificed for His sake - has commanded is beloved. Whatever exists of those entitled to inherit, divide the property among them. For cases beyond this, the matter should be referred to the Most Holy Court. The command is in His hand - He ordains as He pleases. In this regard, a decree was revealed in the Land of Mystery, and the shares of missing persons temporarily revert to the existing heirs until the House of Justice is established. After its establishment, its ruling will become manifest. However, the inheritance of those who emigrated in the year when the Ancient Beauty emigrated reverts to their heirs.

<p>In the Tablet to Abu Badi’, this blessed verse was revealed: “We have prescribed for every son to serve his father.” Thus have We ordained the matter in the Book. In one of the Tablets it is revealed, exalted be His words: “O Muhammad! The Countenance of the Ancient One turns to you, makes mention of you, and counsels the people of God regarding the education of children. If a father fails in this most great matter which has been revealed by the Pen of the Ancient King in the Most Holy Book, the right of fatherhood is forfeited and he shall be accounted among the negligent before God. Blessed is he who inscribes God’s counsels on the tablet of his heart and holds fast unto them. Verily, He commands His servants with that which strengthens them, benefits them and draws them near unto Him. He is the Commander, the Ancient of Days.”</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power.</p>
<p>All the Prophets and Chosen Ones have been commanded by God, exalted be His glory, to water the trees of human existence from the Euphrates of refinement and wisdom, that there might be made manifest from each one that which God has deposited within them. Every tree has its visible fruit, and as can be observed, a tree without fruit is fit only for the fire. The purpose of all that they have ordained and taught has been the preservation of the stations and ranks of the human world. Blessed is the soul that, in this divine Day, has laid hold on the principles of God and has not deviated from the true Law. The fruits of the Tree of existence are trustworthiness, religiosity, truthfulness, and purity, and greatest of all, after the recognition of the oneness of the Lord, exalted and glorified be He, is regard for the rights of parents. This matter is recorded in all the divine Books and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Consider what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Worship ye God and associate naught with Him, and show kindness and charity unto the parents.” Observe how kindness to parents has been joined with recognition of the one true God. Blessed be every wise mystic who witnesseth and seeth and readeth and recognizeth and acteth according to that which God hath revealed in the Books of old and in this wondrous Tablet.</p>
<p>In one of the Tablets it hath been revealed, exalted be His words: And regarding the Zakat, We have decreed that they should act according to that which hath been revealed in the Qur’an.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thanksgiving to His loved ones, and glorification to His chosen ones who have not changed His bounty, who have arisen to serve Him, who have spent what they possessed in His path, who have hastened to that which they were commanded in His Book, and who have sought from the ocean of His generosity and the heaven of His bestowal the word of His good-pleasure. These are they whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from God, the Creator of heaven. They speak not until He hath spoken, and act only by His leave, and acknowledge naught save that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His Will.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord of the Day of Judgment and Educator of the worlds! Thou seest Thy trusted servant clinging to the cord of Thy good-pleasure, observing the stations of Thy loved ones, and mentioning them in his correspondence that the Servant might remember them in the Most Exalted Station and the Supreme Summit. O my Lord! Assist him and those who are united with him, then aid them and reinforce them with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, and with the standards of Thy grandeur and the evidences of Thy Revelation. Verily, Thou art our God, our Goal, our Object of worship, and the Fulfiller of our needs and the needs of Thy servants and creation. Thou art He Who, O my God, hath established through proof the unity of Thy Being and the uniqueness of Thy attributes. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art worthy to answer.</p>
<p>The letters of that beloved one arrived continuously until two weeks ago. Their arrival was like the breezes of spring, and responses were written like rain. Despite the multitude of occupations and extensive correspondence which they have witnessed, there was no delay whatsoever in responding to the letters of that beloved one. We beseech God to assist that beloved one in that which will cause the spread of God’s signs and the sanctification and glorification of His Cause. Each time a letter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke words imbued with special favors and perfumed with the fragrances of the mercy of God, exalted be His glory. And on this blessed night, which is the sixteenth of the honored month of Shawwal, that beloved one’s letter which had arrived several weeks ago was once again presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court and achieved the honor of being heard. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Amin, upon thee be the Glory of God, the True King, the Manifest Justice! Thy letters which thou didst send to the servant in attendance were presented in the Most Holy Court. That which thou didst write mentioning the loved ones of that land was all heard. Praise be to God, they have been assisted in that for which they were brought from nothingness into being. All the peoples of the world, from kings to subjects, from learned to jurisprudents and others, have been and are seekers of truth. Yet when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the heaven of will, all were prevented and veiled. Glory be to God! Despite their seeking they are deprived, and despite their longing they are barred. The people of Europe turn to churches, the Jews to temples, the Muslims to mosques, and likewise other religions to monasteries and the like - all seek the truth, yet Truth itself beareth witness to the heedlessness and remoteness of these souls. The hopes of limited days and their vanities have occupied them all and deprived them of everlasting bounties and eternal favors. To this the Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness in its praiseworthy station.</p>
<p>O Amin! Exert thyself to the utmost to promote unity among the loved ones of God. Gird up the loins of endeavour for the manifestation of unity among the people of love, particularly those souls who are adorned with the ornament of distinction. Say: O friends! When any soul, for the sake of God, showeth humility and submissiveness towards any one of the loved ones to exalt the word of unity, that humility and submissiveness becometh a means of elevation and ascension. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in the Kingdom of knowledge and utterance.</p>
<p>That which thou didst write concerning Ali Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God, hath been noted. Praise be to God, he hath been and still is successful in rendering service before the Presence. Give him the glad-tidings of My special favours. Convey to all the friends the greetings of the Wronged One. Thou didst make mention of those who are firm in their faith and who have turned towards God, who are adorned with the ornament of certitude and who are gazing towards the Most Exalted Horizon. This Wronged One hath likewise made mention of each one. God willing, may they attain unto that which will conduce to the reformation of the world and the guidance of all peoples. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>Praise and thanksgiving be unto God, for He hath ever remembered and continueth to remember His loved ones. By the effulgent lights of the countenance of our Desired One and our Beloved, were the fruits of God’s remembrance - exalted be His glory - to be revealed even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would become detached from the world and all that is therein, yearning for but one word to be revealed from the Supreme Pen. At present most matters are hidden, but ere long that shall be manifested of which most people are now heedless.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of the spiritual friend Ali Haydar and likewise the honoured master Naib, upon them both be the Glory of God and His favours. In truth, they are firm in the Cause and steadfast in service. This evanescent servant hath borne and continueth to bear this testimony before the Divine Throne.</p>
<p>Concerning the two supporters, two benefactors, two servants and two beloved ones - namely the honored brothers Naddaf, upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful - after presenting your letter in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these luminous words were revealed, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O Amin, upon thee be My glory! Reflect upon God’s confirmations and assistance. Whoso is for God, God is for him. I swear by the Sun of Truth that they are more renowned and well-known among the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the heavens than among the people of earth. Divine blessing has been and continues to be with them. Consider the early days of the Most Great Prison - blessings, bounties and heavenly sustenance descended like rain, but when treachery appeared, it was cut off, such that commerce was suspended and most were scattered. The Hand of Divine Power exalted the Prison to such a degree that it rivaled the highest Paradise and the supreme Heaven, yet the treachery of the treacherous ones closed the gates of goodly gifts. O Amin, convey to these two souls the greetings and salutations of the Wronged One. Their mention is immortalized in the Books and Scriptures of God. What thou hast written concerning their mention, their enthusiasm and their detachment is the truth in which there is no doubt. We beseech God to preserve them and make them among those who have taken their station near the mercy of their Lord in all His worlds. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. Their reward is with God. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified to their acceptance, their love, their steadfastness and their service. This is a testimony that neither the riches of the world nor the treasures of nations can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” The lamp of utterance is illumined with the oil of wisdom and bestoweth light and radiance upon all the cities of justice and fairness. This lamp shall never be extinguished, nor shall contrary winds prevent its light. The Command is in His grasp, He doeth what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of the friends in Gokchay and Chakan, a Most Holy Tablet hath been revealed for them from the heaven of divine Will, and mention of that beloved one hath also been revealed therein. I beseech God to assist them to read and understand its meanings. Likewise, a letter was sent specifically for Isma’il Bey, upon him be the glory of God.</p>
<p>The Beloved One mentioned in one of His letters the meeting with the spiritual friend, Aqa ’Ali-Haydar, and Sayyah Effendi, noting that he desired to meet with both them and the Beloved One. He had also written inquiring what should be done in these matters and had sought guidance. After these passages were presented at the supreme horizon and the loftiest heights, the tongue of grandeur spoke these blessed words - His glory be exalted and His bounties be universal:</p>
<p>O Amin! Repeatedly hast thou seen the Wronged One, and in each instance when thou didst arrive in the prison-land, thou didst circle round for successive months and didst dwell beneath the canopies of grandeur. Face to face thou didst hear that which conduceth to the building of the world, the reformation of nations, the elevation of souls and the purification of hearts. The Supreme Pen, without veil or concealment, declareth: O My loved ones! O party of God! Know with clear certitude that this Most Great Revelation hath come to extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity that lieth hidden in hearts and minds. The company of loved ones in all regions must strive that perchance through the waters of counsel and the rivers of exhortation they may purify the world, so that the kindled fire may be quenched and the horizons may be illumined with the light of unity. From any matter wherein can be detected even an atom’s weight of mischief, conflict, contention, or the grief of any soul, the people of God must withdraw as they would from a deadly serpent.</p>
<p>This exalted Word proclaimeth in the scriptures, books and tablets with the most loud call, declaring in the most clear language: O peoples of the earth! The Glad-Tidings of God have come! This is the time of joy, happiness and delight, for strife, dispute and conflict have been forbidden in the divine tablets. This is the Day of reformation, not of corruption. The people of Baha, who have drunk of the choice-sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting, must aid the Cause through goodly admonition, pure deeds and praiseworthy character. Say: This is the host of God, did ye but know, and this is the command of God, did ye but understand. Say: Verily the commander of My armies is the fear of God, did ye but perceive. Victory and triumph in this Most Great Revelation have been ordained to these mentioned hosts. Blessed are they that act and blessed are they that attain.</p>
<p>This matter hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the tablets to such an extent that one would be hard-pressed to enumerate them. This is the truth, and after truth there is naught but error. However, in certain instances where the outright denial of a matter would openly cause the fire of hatred to blaze forth, one must resort to wisdom. In any case, this Most Great Revelation hath never been, nor ever shall be, party to corruption. To this do bear witness My tongue, My heart, My pen, My scriptures, My books and My tablets.</p>
<p>O Amin! Convey My greetings to ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be My glory. Say: Praise be to God, thou art mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and hast attained the bounties of the Dawning-Place of divine mercy. We make mention of all the loved ones in that land and bid them to unity and harmony. And I am, verily, the Commander, the Ruler, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>In the early years, certain followers of the Bayan engaged in acts at the beginning of the Cause which modesty prevents pen and tongue from mentioning. They appropriated people’s property without permission and engaged in forbidden deeds. After Our and your Beloved turned towards Iraq, He would counsel and advise them night and day, both by pen and tongue, until some attained to what God desired. Now, looking back to those days, some still seek through former delusions that which has been and remains rejected by God. In these situations one must resort to wisdom, for if accepted it would be contrary to truth since corruption has been strictly forbidden in the Book, and if denied it would cause sedition. In truth one is perplexed. In any case, this evanescent servant beseeches God to adorn souls with justice and fairness, that love of fleeting days may not prevent them from eternal, endless bounties. Verily our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven has power over all things.</p>
<p>As for the eloquent and exalted praise given of the divine loved ones in the land of Ta, after this matter was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these supreme words were revealed from the Mother Book - blessed and exalted be His words: “O Amin! Blessed art thou for having mentioned My loved ones in Ta. Convey My glory unto them, remind them of My remembrances, and give them the glad tidings of My favors. Those souls who have turned from that land towards the Most Holy Court are at this moment mentioned in the presence. We have preferred some over others and ordained for them abundant good in the Book.” End quote. This evanescent one also extends greetings, praise and glory to all, and begs God, exalted be His glory, for assistance and confirmation for all. It is hoped they will be enkindled with the fire of love and will guide the people of the contingent world to the horizon of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance.</p>
<p>Regarding your written request to sometimes attain the presence of that Beloved One, this supplication was accepted. Praise be to God, this servant was successful and his deed was adorned with the ornament of acceptance.</p>
<p>As for your mention of the honored master, Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, after it was presented He smiled and said: “Excellent is what Amin has done in mentioning him. We have mentioned him before and sent him a Tablet testifying to My grace towards him and My favors unto him. Give him the glad tidings We have given thee. Say: Grieve not, for the fragrance of My favor has not ceased, nor has My pen’s movement in thy mention. Verily thy Lord is with thee in all conditions.” End quote. Indeed they have attained to that which has no equal. Happy is he and blessed is he.</p>
<p>And mention was made of Aqa Mirza Habibu’llah and Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, upon them be the Glory of God, and likewise their being enkindled with divine love. Today, which is the 16th of the aforementioned month, this servant has specifically written a letter to Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, in response to his letter, and mention is made therein of the spiritual friend Aqa Mirza Habibu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God. That letter contains the verses of God and mentions the forgiveness of certain souls by God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>They have made mention of the spiritual friend, Haji Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, who has requested to be remembered in the Most Holy Court. Praise be to God, he has attained to divine mention and heavenly grace. Blessed be he!</p>
<p>Another letter from that honored one, dated the ninth and last day of Sha’ban, arrived like a sealed vessel. When we broke its seal, musk most fragrant diffused, for it was adorned with mention of the Beloved of all worlds. After its reading and review, one night it was presented at the Most Exalted Horizon. Thus speaks the Lord, exalted and sanctified be He: “O servant present before God! Praise be to God, the Trustee has succeeded in serving the Cause. We beseech God to assist him in uniting hearts and bringing souls into harmony. O Trustee! Regarding what you wrote about unity with Ali Haydar, We have written replies both before and after. God has ever loved unity and harmony. And concerning J and A and A and other friends of that land, as well as mention of their enthusiasm, humility, submissiveness, and arising to serve the Cause of God, exalted be His glory - all attained the honor of being heard, and each received their portion and complete share from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance. Give glad tidings to all. We beseech God to ordain for them the good of every world among His worlds. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the friends of that land and the prisoners in various countries - those souls who, in the path of God, drank from the cup of tribulations and were afflicted with hardship and adversity, and who due to the oppression of the oppressors, namely the ignorant divines, left their homeland and arrived in the Land of Ta, which had been the dawning-place of the manifestation of the Lord of Names and Attributes - all these matters and the names of those who emigrated in the path of God were presented before the throne of the World’s Intended One. After hearing them, the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance surged in such wise that all the pens of the world are incapable of describing it. His mighty and glorious Words declare:</p>
<p>“O Trustee! Upon thee be My Glory! Blessed art thou for having mentioned My loved ones who emigrated from their homeland due to what the hands of the oppressors wrought - those who changed God’s blessing into ingratitude, broke His Covenant, disputed His verses, and arose to extinguish His light. Say: Die in your wrath! Soon shall ye find yourselves in grievous torment while My loved ones dwell in the highest Paradise, and ye shall find no way unto God. Thus has the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this impregnable fortress. We desired to mention each one of them as a token of Our grace, for We are the Expositor, the All-Knowing, and We are the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>“O My Pen! Make mention of him who was named Ismail. Say: Blessed art thou for having turned to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and for having attained to His verses and the fragrances of His days, and for having endured what befell thee at the hands of those who violated the Covenant and the pledges. Hear My call and rejoice in My remembrance. By God’s life! The mention of all the world cannot equal it. Blessed are the people who understand. Sorrows have seized thee in My path; let joy and gladness seize thee through My remembrance. Verily thy Lord is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Loving.”</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Upon thee be My Baha! We bear witness that thou hast heard from Mine enemies that which thou wouldst not wish to hear. Hearken at this moment unto that which God hath created all creation to hear. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world! I testify that Thy remembrance is the cause of the joy of the world, whereunto honored servants bear witness. Let not the happenings of the world sadden thee. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to My Name, the Mighty, the Beloved. That which delighteth the eyes hath been revealed for thee and for My loved ones.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Muhammad! When thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of Mine utterance, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to hear Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting, through which he who announced to the servants Thy Manifestation and what would appear from Thy presence arose, to make me turn toward Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! When thou art illumined by the lights of thy Lord, the Most Merciful’s utterance, and hearest the call of the Wronged One, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me to know Thee, taught me, and guided me. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love and to drink the choice wine of knowledge from the hand of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-‘Ali! O sight! The Lord of Destiny remembereth thee from the direction of His Most Great Scene, remindeth thee of His verses, and giveth thee glad tidings of His grace. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the world, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Creator of the heavens, for having given me to drink the cup of Thy love and enabled me to acknowledge what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and holding fast to the cord of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, to ordain for me that which will preserve me from the arrows of the croakers’ allusions and the swords of the doubts of the infidels. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad (Na’im)! When My utterance’s choice wine taketh thee and thou findest the fragrant breezes of My revelation, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me in Thy prison while Thou wert in the hands of Thine enemies. I beseech Thee by the letters of Thy all-embracing Word, by Thy revealed verses, by the movement of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation, to make me firm in Thy love and steadfast in Thy Cause. Thou art He Whom the hosts of the world have not frightened and the power of nations hath not weakened. Thou takest and givest. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Qanbar-’Ali! Blessed is the servant who hath borne hardships in My love and heard the derision of enemies in My path. He is among the most excellent of servants before his Lord, the Chosen One, and among the most exalted of creation before the Truth. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in its lofty station.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Blessed is the servant who hath journeyed in My path, chosen exile for My Name, and accepted tribulations for My love. He is of the people of My paradise. Upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness, My grace, and My mercy, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Taqi! There hath come upon thee what hath come upon Us. By My life! Poison in My path is honey, and fire is light, and tribulation is mercy, and adversity is bounty, and hardship is a feast. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken unto thee in the prison of ’Akka, that thou mayest hear and be of those who render thanks.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Hajji Siyyid Mirza. Say: Blessed art thou for having turned unto My horizon and hearkened unto My call. Well is it with thee for having honored the dwelling-place of those who were forced to abandon their homes through the actions of the oppressors. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath sheltered them, honored them, fed them and shown them kindness. Verily, We are with them, hearing and seeing. Thy Lord, in truth, is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to assist thee, to strengthen thee, and to ordain for thee that which shall profit thee. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>All praise be to God, all have been immersed in the waves of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance. After the names were presented, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in such wise that every hearer was astounded and every speaker was rendered speechless. For each of the mentioned souls, a river flowed and mercy was bestowed. Likewise, regarding those souls who showed love and affection to the emigrants, that which hath been sent down from the heaven of divine will for each one beareth witness to the ocean of the All-Merciful’s mercy. In truth, holy souls in their stations have hoped and yearned for this station. The command is in His grasp; He assisteth whom He willeth through His mercy, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. This lowly one also conveyeth greetings and praise to each one, and beseecheth assistance from God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>The petition of Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Hasan (’A.T.), upon him be the Glory of God, was received and was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence on Tuesday night, the nineteenth of the honored month of Shawwal, two hours after nightfall, and was graced with the lights of acceptance. Blessed is he and well is it with him. A sublime, most exalted, most glorious, most wondrous Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all beings specifically for him and was sent. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist him to receive the blessed Tablet through His strength and His power, that he may drink from the cups of his Lord’s utterance, the Kawthar of His knowledge. Verily, our Lord and your Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what was submitted about the ascension of the departed wife, upon her be the Glory of God and His mercy, and her will, He said: “Her sins are forgiven.” As mention was made of her in the Most Holy Presence, the blessed word of pardon was revealed concerning her. Regarding her will, what was done in consideration of wisdom was adorned with the honor of acceptance, and the remainder should be given to the Trustee, who should give it to certain specified persons.</p>
<p>Concerning what was requested about the other wife, upon her be the Glory of God, after it was presented before Him, a most mighty and exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for her and was sent. His bounty hath encompassed, His mercy hath preceded, and His favor hath been complete, yet the people are in evident opposition. Soon shall the veils be rent asunder and the servants shall discover that of which they are heedless today, and shall turn unto that from which they now turn away. Verily, our Lord and your Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be,” and it is.</p>
<p>And concerning what they wrote about the parents, after it was presented in the presence of Him in Whose grasp is the Kingdom of all things, these exalted words were revealed from the heaven of will. He saith, blessed and exalted be He: Say […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest me attracted by Thy verses, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty, enkindled with the fire of Thy love, and soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness. I beseech Thee by the Hands of Thy Cause, the Daysprings of Thy power, and the Dawning-places of Thy grandeur and might, to ordain for me and for those related to me that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and guide us to Thy straight path and Thy mighty Cause. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I know not what harmeth or profiteth me. Verily, Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Ordain for me, O my God, that which will enable me to serve Thy Cause and through which Thy Most Exalted Word may be upraised among all people. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The favor of God, glorified be His majesty, hath seized them, and that which hath been revealed shall neither change nor alter. Verily the grace is in His hands; He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>As to their question concerning the departure of the spirit and its state in the other worlds, after being submitted to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these sublime words, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O thou who drinkest the wine of My love and soarest on the wings of certitude in the atmosphere of My nearness! Various statements have repeatedly been revealed from the tongue of the Lord of all beings in the Tablets. The Prophets and Messengers have veiled the understanding of this station for the preservation of the world. In truth, were a soul to reflect upon that which hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen regarding these stations, he would know with absolute certitude that no faculty hath been created in this world capable of comprehending and knowing its reality. However, this much may be mentioned: By the life of God! The lights and effulgences of those pure spirits who ascend detached from the world and purified from the doubts of the nations, are the cause and source of the manifestation of knowledge, wisdom, crafts, and the preservation of creation. Death shall not overtake them, and their consciousness, understanding, power and strength are beyond the reckoning of minds and comprehension. The lights of these spirits are the educators of the world and its peoples. Were this station to be fully unveiled, all souls would seek to ascend and the world would be revolutionized.”</p>
<p>In these days, one of the friends from the land of Qaf and Vav asked about this matter, and an answer was revealed from the Kingdom of utterance of our Lord, the All-Merciful. It is mentioned here exactly as it was revealed, that the loved ones may drink from the wine of divine utterance and attain unto the station of supreme steadfastness.</p>
<p>Regarding what was asked about whether the soul endures after the body’s extinction and, if it endures, what state it will have, He, blessed and exalted be He, says: As to what you asked about the spirit and its survival after its ascension, know that it will ascend at the time of its passing until it attains the presence of God in a form which neither the succession of centuries and ages, nor the changes and chances of the world can alter. It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His dominion and power will endure. From it will be made manifest the signs of God and His attributes, and the loving-kindness of God and His bounties. The pen is unable to move in mentioning this station and its loftiness and sublimity as it truly is. The hand of divine grace will lead it to a station that no expression can befittingly describe, nor any other earthly thing can indicate. Blessed is the spirit that hath emerged from the body purified from the doubts and superstitions of the nations. That spirit moveth in the atmosphere of God’s pleasure and entereth the Supreme Paradise. The denizens of the retreats of the Exalted Paradise circle around it, and it consorteth with the Prophets of God and His chosen ones, conversing with them of what it hath endured in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. If anyone were to be made aware of what hath been ordained for it in the worlds of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, he would immediately yearn with a great longing for that most exalted, most sanctified and most resplendent station.</p>
<p>Hear in the Persian tongue, O ’Abdu’l-Vahhab, upon thee be My glory! As to thy question about the survival of the spirit, this Wronged One beareth witness to its immortality. And as to thy question about its nature, verily it cannot be described, nor is it meet to mention it except to a predetermined degree. The Prophets and Messengers have come to guide creation to the straight path of Truth, and their purpose hath been the education of souls so that at the time of ascension they may, with utmost sanctity, detachment and severance, set out for the Most Exalted Companion. By the life of God! The effulgences of these spirits are the cause of the development of the world and the stations of nations. They are the essence of existence and the ultimate cause for the appearances and crafts of the world. Through them the clouds pour down rain and the earth bringeth forth. Nothing among all things existeth without cause, reason and origin, and the greatest cause hath been and shall ever be these sanctified spirits. The difference between this world and that world is like the difference between the embryonic world and this world. In brief, after ascension it attaineth the presence of God in a form worthy of immortality and suited to that world. This immortality is temporal immortality, not essential immortality, for it hath a cause, while essential immortality is without cause and belongeth exclusively to God, exalted be His glory. Well is it with them that comprehend!</p>
<p>If thou wouldst reflect upon the deeds of the Prophets, thou wouldst bear witness with absolute certitude that there are worlds besides this world. The philosophers of the earth, as revealed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Tablet of Wisdom, have mostly acknowledged what hath been revealed in the divine Books. However, the materialists who believe in nature have written concerning the Prophets that they were philosophers who, for the education of the people, made mention of Paradise, hell, reward and punishment. Now consider how all people, in whatever world they dwell, have regarded the Prophets as taking precedence over all others. Some call these detached essences philosophers […]</p>
<p>Some consider these abstract essences as wise philosophers while others regard them as being from God. Now if such souls had considered the divine worlds to be limited to this world, they would never have given themselves into the hands of enemies and endured sufferings and hardships that have no parallel. If a person contemplates with a pure heart and penetrating vision that which has shone forth from the Most Exalted Pen, they will speak with the tongue of their true nature saying “Now hath the truth become manifest.”</p>
<p>As for your letter numbered 10 dated the twenty-eighth of Ramadan, it opened a new door and brought fresh tidings, including news of your health and well-being and your arising to serve the Divine Cause, as well as word of the well-being of those friends and loved ones who are adorned with the ornament of distinction. Glory be to God! This tongueless messenger has conveyed so many words. God willing, may it ever be in motion. Patience is beloved in every station except in this one, for a messenger coming from the loved ones of Truth must move with utmost haste and arrive in quick succession.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Leaf, the handmaiden of God, upon her be the Glory of God, after it was presented at the Most Holy Court, this supreme Word shone forth from the horizon of divine utterance - exalted be His blessed and transcendent Word: “O Amin, upon thee be My glory. You and your kinfolk have been and are of the Truth. Convey greetings to each one on behalf of the Truth and give them the glad-tidings of His grace, mercy and bounty. And concerning the Leaf, what you mentioned has been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. We beseech God to aid them both in that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of the Throne and Earth, and the Lord of the Last and the First.”</p>
<p>And likewise your other letter numbered 1 and dated the 6th of Shawwal was a book in praise and glorification of the Goal of all the worlds and His loved ones and chosen ones. A hundred thousand thanks to the Intended Lord that He granted you the grace of mention and this servant the grace of hearing. The Command is in His hand and He is the All-Commanding, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about sending the prayer of His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, so that it might be presented in His presence - at this moment this evanescent servant was present in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and, after permission was granted, presented it. When it was concluded, the gate of this utterance was opened with the key of grace - blessed and exalted be His Word: “Verily We have heard your call and have answered you time and again. Praise be to God, in every letter your mention has been made. The Sun of Grace has ever been shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of divine mercy. You have attained to that which the world has been awaiting. Grace is in His hand and bounty is in the grasp of His power. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The Sun of Divine Bounty has encompassed the world of being and His favors are like torrential rain descending at every moment upon His loved ones. Who is capable of rendering thanks unless His aid takes hold and His bounty accepts what has appeared? He is the All-Generous and He is the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>The petition of Aqa Mulla Muhammad (’A.T.), upon him be the Glory of God, after being submitted to the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, a special Sacred Tablet was revealed and sent to him. May he, God willing, drink from the Kawthar of utterance and be illumined by the lights of the Sun of inner meanings. Furthermore, the Tongue of Utterance spoke these exalted words concerning him - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“Praise be to God that he has attained to recognition and acceptance. We beseech God to grant him steadfastness, for the liars of old have emerged from behind the veil and are diligently striving to organize a party like the party of before. O Trustee, beseech God not to deprive His servants of the luminary of justice and fairness. Verily, He is powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveys greetings to him and beseeches God, exalted be His Glory, for that which causes steadfastness and arising to serve the Cause. Praise be to God that through divine grace, mercy and forgiveness he has attained and is mentioned by the Supreme Pen. Blessed be he.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of Mulla Ghulam-Riday-i-Jasbi, upon him be God’s eternal Glory, and the mention of his being set ablaze with the fire of divine love, after being submitted before the Divine Presence, these exalted words were revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning him - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Ghulam-Rida! Upon thee be My Glory! Thou hast ever been and art still remembered. We beseech God to assist thee in that which causes the exaltation of His Word and the steadfastness of His servants. Beseech God to protect His servants lest they become afflicted with the darkness of idle fancies and vain imaginings like the former party, and remain deprived of the lights of true unity. The people of the Bayan have newly intended to organize a Shi’ih party. May God protect Us and you from the evil of these people. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.”</p>
<p>This servant is astonished at how quickly they became veiled and heedless of what they have seen and continue to see. What profit did the former party gain, and what service did they render unto God on the Day of Reckoning, except to occupy themselves with cursing from pulpits and issuing verdicts for bloodshed? Now consider the lack of vision among the people. By the Sun of Truth, they are deprived of hearing, sight, and understanding. May God grant vision and bestow fairness.</p>
<p>And likewise regarding the mention of Mashhadi Nasru’llah, Mashhadi Husayn, Aqa Muhammad-?adiq and his brother, upon them be the Glory of God, after this matter was submitted before the Divine Throne, these verses shone forth from the Dayspring of clear signs - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Nasru’llah! Upon thee be the Glory of God! For God’s sake I speak, and for His Face I declare: The luminary of fairness is veiled and the light of justice is not visible. Steadfastness is like the phoenix - mentioned but non-existent. Beseech God to make thee and His loved ones firm and steadfast in His Cause. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Husayn! Upon thee be My Glory! This Wronged One remembers thee in prison, that perchance through the breaths of remembrance thou mayest hold fast unto the cord of the One remembered - a hold which the entire world would be powerless to sever. This is the station of man. Blessed is he who holdeth fast unto the cord of God’s grace, the Lord of all worlds.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Sadiq! The Most Exalted Pen makes mention of thee at a time when it is imprisoned and wronged before the heedless ones. It counsels thee to steadfastness in His Cause. Whosoever hath drunk from the waters of steadfastness is numbered by the Most Exalted Pen among the dwellers of the Crimson Ark. Blessed art thou and blessed are they that are with thee and have believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. Today steadfastness is accounted as the most great of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed is he that hath attained, and woe unto the heedless ones. His honor the Trustee hath made mention of each one; therefore all have been blessed through the influence of the Most Exalted Pen. We have made mention of those whose names thou didst recount before the Wronged One, and We have sent down for them that which will draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed is he that hath turned towards Him, and woe unto them that have turned away.</p>
<p>This servant conveys greetings and glorification to each one, and gives them the glad-tidings of God’s favors. This is the day of turning towards God, of attention and steadfastness. Blessed are those souls whom the whisperings of Satan have not prevented from the Most Exalted Horizon nor deprived thereof. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon those who are with you and love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>19th of the honored month of Shawwal 1304</p>
<p>=== END BH00070 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00071 ===</p>
<p>God hath ordained that in every town wherein this Tablet is proclaimed, its inhabitants shall celebrate on that day and shall magnify His Name and glorify Him and shall live in the utmost felicity, and shall be numbered among the thankful ones. He is the Everlasting, the Manifest.</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath sent down the verses in truth and doth send them down through His command as He pleaseth. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Nothing can prevent His command and His sovereignty. He doeth what He willeth in the dominion of creation and command, and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Before Him bow down in worship all who are in the heavens and on earth. He giveth life and causeth death, then He quickeneth whom He willeth from this sweet, holy and resplendent Kawthar. Say: By God! The Spirit of the Cause hath appeared in truth, and the Beauty of the Divine Unity hath dawned from the holy Dayspring with manifest sovereignty. Through Him God hath tested all who are in the kingdoms of creation and command, and verily He is God’s Balance between the heavens and the earth. Say: The Tree of Sinai in this Revelation doth speak the truth, proclaiming: “There is none other God but I, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful.” Say: O people! Fear God and differ not concerning the Word of God, for verily it hath appeared in truth through a command that causeth all who are in the heavens and on earth to swoon away, except whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, the All-Praised. Say: It hath been among you and God’s verses have been recited unto you at all times, yet ye perceived them not, having been seized by vain imaginings and being in manifest heedlessness. Thus did God withhold your eyes from recognizing His Self, though He was among you with a Beauty the like of which none among the ancients hath ever witnessed. O servant! Hearken unto the call of God from this Tree which hath been raised upon the holy mountain and speaketh the truth that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Say: This is a call the like of which none hath ever heard from time immemorial, nor shall any hear it save he who entereth this exalted and impregnable Paradise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! With the ears of the spirit hear thou God’s call from this Leaf that hath sprouted, that moveth, that is upraised, and that singeth upon this divine and transcendent Tree of Oneness. Turn not to any soul but put thy trust in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Turn unto Him and fear no one, and be not of the heedless. Know thou that when thou didst depart from Our presence, We commanded thee and counseled thee with mighty and conclusive counsels. Among these was Our command that thou shouldst neither exceed what thou didst witness during thy migration with God, nor fall short of what thou didst observe. This was My command unto thee, to which all existence beareth witness, and beyond it the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Yet thou hast added to people’s vain imaginings and diminished from what thou didst witness of the power of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old. O Muhammad! Fear God and follow not thy desires, and alter not God’s favor unto thyself and unto the souls of His servants, and be not of the ignorant. Fear God in thine own self, then behold the Cause of God with thine eyes, then rend asunder the veils of fancy through My Name, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise. If thou wilt not rend the veils from before thy heart unto all eternity, We shall not withhold the reins of the Cause and shall continue to command thee thus, by the eternity of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, until thou rendest asunder the veils and arisest from the Dawning-Place of the Cause with power and manifest sovereignty. O Muhammad! Teach thyself, then teach the people how the Face hath appeared from behind the veils with resplendent lights of mighty glory. Then remind the people of what thou wast commanded by God, and delay not therein for less than a moment. Gird up thy loins with what We have commanded thee at this time in this luminous and radiant Tablet, and be not of those who follow naught but what their desires command them, and who are among the losers. Know thou that thy Lord is the Knower of all things, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth and the unseen things of the dominion of Command and Creation - this is the truth, if thou be of them that know. No matter is hidden from Him, nor can what passeth through the hearts of men be concealed from Him, and verily He encompasseth all things. Beware, beware, O Muhammad! Hear My words and leave behind thee all who are in the heavens and on earth. Then stand firm in the Cause with steadfastness from Us and by Our command, and be not disturbed within thyself, and be not of the fearful. Hast thou not seen and witnessed the sovereignty of power and might, and hast thou not observed how the Hand of God appeared from behind the veil of holy glory? Hast thou not seen how all matters submitted to His sovereignty and the necks of the Pharaohs bowed before Him, and every person of great might was brought low before Him, even though He was in the hands of His enemies morning and evening, at dawn and at dusk? Hast thou not witnessed the confession of all the learned ones and their powerlessness when the lights of knowledge and wisdom shone upon them from this most luminous, most wondrous and sublime Mouth?</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Be fair for the sake of God, then ponder what hath shone forth through grace, follow not thy desires, and be not of those who turn away. Purify thyself from human limitations, transgress not the law of justice, and turn not thy gaze from the Most Great Horizon, the Exalted, the Supreme. God hath not placed two hearts within any man - this We did send down aforetime unto Muhammad the Arabian in clear Arabic tongue, and have now made it manifest. Polish thou the mirror of thy heart that the beauty of God may be reflected therein. This indeed is Our counsel unto thee and unto Our near servants. By God! His favor unto you hath been perfected, His sovereignty hath appeared, His proof hath come, His evidence hath arrived, and His argument hath been completed, were ye of them that perceive.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We did conceal Our countenance from you for twenty years, to this thy soul and spirit bear witness, and beyond thee all who dwell in the pavilions of eternity behind the seas of immortality among the sacred temples of the sanctified ones. The people were in such doubt concerning this Beauty that none recognized Him, though all appeared before Him daily, heard His verses, and witnessed His light that encompassed all who are in the heavens and earth and the first and the last ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thou wert aforetime the herald of this Revelation unto the people in the ninth year, even as God had given them glad tidings thereof in all the Tablets, nay in every holy Book and illumined Scripture. We prevented thee therefrom for in those days God’s appointed time had not been fulfilled and the promise had not come to pass according to what was ordained in the preserved Tablets of holiness. Then, when the time was fulfilled and the promise came to pass, We commanded thee as thou didst desire aforetime, that thou mightest be of them that remember - a Command at which the heavens and earth cannot stand, even as hath been revealed at that time from God’s mighty and glorious dominion.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! First cleanse thy soul, then thy spirit, then thy essence, then thy body, then thy limbs with this Kawthar which hath flowed in truth from this unerring and mighty Pen. Then cleanse the people therewith as far as thou art able, that the hearts of the mystics may be purified thereby. Know thou that thy Lord is able to transform all who are in the kingdom with a single word from Him, for He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Yet He hath delayed in this that He might distinguish the good from the evil, the blessed from the wretched, and separate the monotheists from the polytheists. Say: By God! The test hath come, whereby the pillars of men shall quake and the hearts of them that are nigh shall tremble. Say: Those who disdained to worship their Lord, they preferred blindness to guidance and darkness to light, and they are in manifest loss.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Remind the people of this sanctuary and sacred precinct, for this is a station which God hath made holy, purified from all defilement and cleansed from the gaze of the heedless. Thou, verily, ascend on these wings wherewith We have honored thee to a station wherein thou shalt find the whole earth and all that dwell thereon under thy shadow. Then convey unto the people that which We have commanded thee, and be not of the patient ones. Then walk amongst men with a light from Our presence, and if thou findest one who turneth toward thee, turn unto him with thy whole being, and if thou findest one who turneth away, turn thou away from him and put thy trust in God, the Single, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the servants of God, and bar not the gates of bounty against your own faces, and be not of them that perish. O people! Rejoice not in what ye possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings, but rather rejoice in that which is with God. This, verily, is God’s decree upon you, if ye be of them that perceive.</p>
<p>Know thou, O Muhammad, that the idolaters desired to cut off the breezes of God from their wafting and to change the Word of God according to their own desires and passions. Therefore have they imprisoned Us in this land wherefrom the hands of the hopeful and the feet of the seekers have been cut off. Say: God is triumphant in His Cause and mighty in His action. His Command is above your command and His decree above your schemes. He doeth what He willeth and nothing can frustrate His power and sovereignty. He, verily, is the Enduring, the Everlasting, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Soon will He manifest His Cause, exalt His testimony and raise His sovereignty to such a station that the hands of the idolaters shall be cut off therefrom. Thus have We related unto thee from every narrative and expounded unto thee that whereon We stand, and this Most Great, this Mighty Message, that thine eyes and the eyes of those who behold naught save this most glorious, this most noble Perspective may be solaced thereby.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Breathe the spirit of everlasting life upon the temples of all beings, then sever thy relationship from all who claim relationship and hold fast unto this firm and gleaming Handle, that through thee may blow the breezes of detachment upon all who dwell on earth. And when thou arrivest in the land of Qaf, remind its people of that which We have commanded thee in this Tablet, that thou mayest be a bearer of glad tidings from Us unto the sincere ones.</p>
<p>Then remind from Our presence the letter Ha, that he may rejoice within himself at the glad tidings of God and be among those who are content. Say: O letter Ha! Thou didst ask God, thy Lord, in years past concerning that which We sent down in truth in an august foreign tongue, and We held back the reins of the Pen in answering thee when We found thee in heedlessness and great intoxication. By God! The heavens wept at this, and the holy earth trembled, and the mountains of knowledge crumbled, and the breasts of them that are nigh were straitened. Say: O Hadi! By what evidence didst thou believe in ’Ali before him, and before him in Muhammad the Apostle of God, and before him in the Son of Mary, and before him in Moses Who conversed with God, and before him in the Friend of the All-Merciful, and before him in Noah the Prophet, even unto the return of the Message to the Primal Point? Bring forth thy proof if thou be of the truthful! If thou didst believe in them through the verses of God that were sent down unto them, then by God this is those very verses and this Beauty is their Beauty - behold it, if ye be of them that bear witness! Beyond this, the horizons have been filled with the lights of this Dawning, and the Sovereign of Names hath appeared with every sublime grace and wondrous garment. Say: By God, O letter Ha! Thy spirit wept when this question issued from thy mouth and flowed from thy pen, yet thou knewest not and wast among the heedless. Know thou that thy Lord, while in the sovereignty of His concealment, cannot be comprehended by names nor attributes nor by the hearts of the Messengers. But when He is established upon the throne of Manifestation, all names and attributes serve Him as a servant serveth his lord, if ye be of them that perceive. He, in His own Essence, is sanctified above all that and above all that ye have known, and this is what hath been sent down in truth from the heaven of august glory. Have ye not witnessed that all these were created by His Word? And if ye do not bear witness, We indeed have borne witness to it in truth and We were its Witness and Knower. Bear thou witness that the Sun was created by His command - God created it through grace and made it the lamp of His might between the heavens and the earth. In like manner, recognize all the names in His vicinity, if thou be of them that perceive. Yet despite this, how art thou not content that We should attribute one of the names unto Our own Self, after We have shown you the Cause with a clear proof? We created the names and their kingdom through the sovereignty of power and might, yet thou hast forbidden their Creator from one of their names - thus hast thou done, if thou be of them that are aware. We have pardoned thee, that thou mayest seek forgiveness of God thy Lord and be of them that repent.</p>
<p>O servant! Fear God, then open thine eyes that thou mayest behold the Cause of God with thine own vision. By God! Nothing will suffice thee today if thou shouldst cling to the first and the last, save that thou enter beneath the shadow of God - and this is His shadow that hath encompassed the worlds. Say: By God the Truth! After His manifestation nothing will suffice you and nothing will profit you, even if ye should seek to prove by all that ye possess from the tokens of the heedless. Then know that all that ye have heard hath appeared by My command while ye were in heedlessness and thick veils, and all that ye have apprehended and learned or known and used as proof returneth to My Word, even as it returned in the ancient centuries. Say: Do ye wish to veil the beauty of the Sun with the veils of rancor and hatred, or with the clouds of your idle fancies, O company of the opposers? Or do ye wish to prevent the sea of God from its waves, or the fire of the Cause from its burning? Evil is that which ye have imagined within yourselves.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye be hindered by the veils of malice and hatred or by the clouds of your vain imaginings, O company of the heedless! Ye cannot stop God’s ocean from its waves nor the Fire of His Cause from its blazing. Evil indeed is what ye have imagined within yourselves and grievous is what ye have done, and ye shall remain among those who persist therein. Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye join partners with God or oppose Him through what ye possess. Remember that which ye were enjoined in the Scriptures and Tablets. Fear God and be among the God-fearing. Was this not from among God’s verses? Was this Youth not His servant, His Beauty, His Glory, His Splendor, His Cause and His Light? He hath shone forth with such lights that at their dawning all suns were eclipsed - how much more these darkened ones! Say: By God! He hath descended from the heaven of Command, and in His right hand is the Kingdom of might and power. He summoneth mankind unto the holy Paradise and feareth no one, even were all the idolaters to surround Him. Say: Verily He appeared once by the name of the Primal Point, then once by the name of the Friend, then once by the name of the Interlocutor, then by the name of the Spirit, then by the name of the Beloved, then by the name of Ali in truth, then by the name of Husayn in this sacred, resplendent and luminous Beauty. All this We mention unto you because We found the people in weakness, otherwise, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, We would have imparted unto you such melodies as would draw unto them the hearts of the Concourse on High and would cause all who dwell in the realms of creation to swoon away. Say: O people! Have mercy on Him Who hath come unto you with God’s proof and evidence, Who calleth you unto Him and unto that which hath been sent down from His presence. And if ye believe not in Him, then leave Him to Himself and oppose Him not, and be not of the heedless ones. Do ye not witness how He hath arisen by Himself while all the peoples have risen against Him with all they possess? Do ye deny this grace after having witnessed it with your own eyes? Be ye among those who bear witness. He Himself hath feared no one and will never fear, by God’s might and power. He hath conveyed the Cause to the East of the earth and to its West and all that lieth between them, to everyone possessed of power, sovereignty and mighty strength. Were ye able, come forth from your places and raise your heads from the eggs of heedlessness that ye may behold God’s power and what hath appeared from Him, and witness your own powerlessness and the powerlessness of all created things. Have not the banners of victory been raised? Hath not this Name, the Name of God, filled the space between heaven and earth? Have I not sacrificed myself every day and every moment? Say: By God! I have not protected myself for less than an instant and have shone like the sun above the heads of the enemies, while ye have not aided God for even an instant, sitting in your homes and hiding your faces from the loved ones - how much more these oppressors! Despite this, ye have occupied yourselves with the imaginings commanded by your selves and desires, and thus hath Satan made your deeds seem fair unto you, and ye were among the doers. Say: O people! Can one who soareth in the atmosphere of the spirit be compared with one who playeth with clay? Can one who shineth forth before the enemies be compared with one who hideth his face behind veils out of fear for himself? Judge fairly then, if ye be of the fair-minded. Can one who walketh in the holy Paran be compared with one who sitteth at home? Consider this, O heedless ones! Say: By God! The acceptance of all who are in the heavens […]</p>
<p>Say: O people! Can one who soars in the atmosphere of the spirit be compared to one who plays with clay? Can one who stands resplendent before his enemies be likened to him who, out of fear for himself, conceals his face behind veils? Judge ye fairly if ye be of the fair-minded. Can one who walks in the sacred Paran be compared to one who sits idle at home? Reflect, O ye heedless ones! Say: By God! The acceptance or rejection of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth is, in My sight, even as the cry of an ant in a vast and mighty desert. Say: No one’s lamentation or cry shall ever ascend unto God save through this Most Great Name, this Most Upright, this Ancient Cause. Say: By the True God! Nothing of what was or what will be shall profit you this day, except that ye take refuge in this Most Firm, this Mighty Stronghold. Say: O Letter of Ha! Were it possible, We would have commanded thee to expend, in response to thy request, a thousand thousand thousand thousand qintars of white diamonds, until thy breath be cut off, for from thy question have wafted the odors of aversion and the dust of grief upon all worlds. For all that hath been sent down from My presence is that whereby ye have deduced the authority of God’s proofs in every age, cycle and era, and ye yourselves bear witness to this, as do all possessed of knowledge behind you. Why then didst thou accept what appeared from them while rejecting what appeared from them in another guise? Believest thou in part of the Book while denying part? This indeed is a grievous injustice! By God! The eyes of the seen and unseen have wept over Me for what ye have supposed regarding Me, and ye were among those who harbored suspicions. In those days I concealed Myself from those who accepted and those who rejected, and veiled Myself behind a thousand veils lest anyone should recognize Me and lest the clamor of the hypocrites be raised. We were among you as one of you, and thereby did God test your vision and found you among the veiled ones. Say: The Educator and Creator of all contingent beings was indeed in the garb of a common person, yet ye were not content with this until He was imprisoned in this prison. Then when He appeared with the truth and drew aside the veil from His face, and shone forth from God’s dayspring, the Protector, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Omnipotent, when the idolaters turned against Us, We turned against them and manifested Our Self with truth that they might know that God fears no one, that no matter distracts Him from another matter, and that neither the opposition of the opposers nor the sovereignty of sovereigns can prevent His sovereignty. O Muhammad! Command the people with what God hath commanded thee, then teach them what God hath taught thee from His presence, then aid Him with thy heart and tongue and all thou possessest and all that is upon thee. His is the victory of the heavens and earth, the victory of what is seen and unseen, and the victory of all worlds. Then We have ordained in the Tablet of Decree by the Pen of Accomplishment for whosoever hath conceived doubts in his soul and hesitated in this wondrous and novel Cause, and for whosoever desireth to turn towards the holy precincts and attain the presence of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and hear God’s call and behold His beauty and inhale the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Transcendent, the Great, that he should leave his house migrating unto God until he enters the City which is named the Abode of Peace. And when he arrives therein, let him glorify God his Lord secretly and openly until he reaches the shore, and when he reaches it, let him don his finest garments, then perform ablutions as God hath commanded him in the Book, and when he washes his hands, let him say […]</p>
<p>O my Lord! This is the water which Thou hast caused to flow by Thy command in the vicinity of Thy Sacred House. And as I have washed my hands therewith by Thy command, O my God, cleanse me from all defilement and sin and heedlessness and from all that Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Then he washes his face and says:</p>
<p>O my Lord! This is my face which I have cleansed by Thy will. I beseech Thee, by the sovereignty of Thy singleness and the wonders of the names of the Manifestations of Thy Cause, to purify it from all else besides Thee. Then preserve it from turning to any but Thee and from gazing upon those who have not sought Thy manifest, pure, mighty and gracious Beauty.</p>
<p>Then he crosses the bridge with God’s dignity and tranquility, magnifying God until reaching the end of the bridge. Then he turns toward the House and says at his first step:</p>
<p>O my Lord! This is the first step I have taken on the path of Thy good-pleasure and the first footstep I have moved by Thy will. I have fled, O my God, from all directions toward the direction of Thy grace and bounty, and I have escaped from myself and from all else besides Thee toward the quarter of Thy generosity and favors. My God! Disappoint not those who hope in Thee from the clouds of Thy mercy and favor, and prevent not those who seek Thee from the clouds of Thy glory and bounty. Here am I, O my God, having sought Thy House, around which circle the dwellers of the Supreme Concourse and beneath which dwell the spirits of Thy near ones among the chosen ones. I beseech Thee by it and by them that Thou withhold not my sight from beholding the wondrous lights of the sanctity of Thy beauty, and deprive not my face from the manifestations of the breezes of the dawn of Thy meeting, and close not off from my heart the fragrances of the might of Thy revelation and inspiration. Verily Thou art the Lord of bounty and might, the Lord of grace and mercy and dominion, and verily Thou art the Lord of power and strength and grandeur, and verily Thou art to him who calls upon Thee near and responsive.</p>
<p>Then he glorifies God and begins the circumambulation, circling the House seven times. When he completes his deed and faces the door of the House, he stands and seeks God’s forgiveness seventy times. Then he says:</p>
<p>O my God and my Master! Praise be to Thee for having honored me and blessed me, whereby Thou hast established me in a station wherein naught is seen save the signs of the might of the sovereignty of Thy oneness, and naught is witnessed save the flashes of the lights of the sun of Thy beauty. I beseech Thee by Thyself and by Thy Self to deliver me from the murk of the world and its ornaments, and to rend from before the face of my heart the veils that have prevented me from entering into the depths of the seas of the might of Thy oneness and have barred me from arriving at the fields of the sanctity of Thy reunion and meeting. O Lord! Return me not disappointed from the gate of Thy mercy, and drive me not away from Thy House as a loser. O Lord! Forgive me and my parents and my brothers and my family and my kindred from among those who have believed in Thee and in Thy most great signs in the Manifestation of Thy most exalted Beauty. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Then he walks with perfect tranquility and glorifies God until reaching the door. He stands and says:</p>
<p>My God! This is the station wherein Thou didst raise Thy voice and Thy proof appeared and Thy traces rose and Thy beauty shone forth and Thy verses descended and Thy Cause became manifest and Thy Name was lifted up and Thy remembrance was spread abroad and Thy power was perfected and Thy sovereignty was exalted over all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Then he addresses the House and its ground and its wall and all that is therein and says […]</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O House, in that God hath made thee the place whereon His foot hath trod! Blessed art thou, O House, in that the glances of His glorious majesty have fallen upon thee! Blessed art thou, O House, in that God hath chosen thee and made thee a dwelling for Himself and a seat of His sovereignty! No land hath preceded thee save the land which God hath preferred above all other regions of the earth through that which hath been inscribed by His preserving Pen. Blessed art thou, O House, in that through thee God distinguisheth between the fortunate and the wretched from this day until the Day whereon the All-Merciful shall manifest Himself with the lights of holy and wondrous glory! Blessed art thou, and again blessed art thou, in that God hath made thee the balance for the unitarians and the ultimate homeland of the mystics, and hath sanctified thee from the recognition of the hateful ones and the idolaters, such that none shall enter thee save every believer whose heart God hath tested for faith, and none shall be able to draw nigh unto thee save those from whom waft the fragrances of the All-Glorious. Blessed art thou in that God hath made thee specially for those of His servants who are nigh unto Him and for the sincere ones among His creation, and none shall touch thee save those who have detached themselves wholly from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and in whose hearts there is naught save the effulgence of the lights of His glorious unity, and in whose beings there is naught save the manifestations of the revelations of His holy oneness. This is the station wherewith God hath distinguished thee, and by this thou art worthy to glory over all the worlds. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who built thee and developed thee and served thee and watered thy roses, and blessed is he who entereth thee and who beholdeth thee and who findeth from thee the fragrance of the garment of Joseph, the Mighty, the Powerful God. I testify that whoso entereth thee, God will cause him to enter the holy sanctuary on the Day when the Beauty of the Divine Essence shall be established upon a magnificent throne, and He shall forgive everyone who taketh refuge with thee and entereth beneath thy shade, and shall fulfill his needs, and shall gather him on the Day of Resurrection in the beauty whereby its people, of the first and the last, shall be illumined.</p>
<p>Then he shall cast his face upon the dust of the gate and shall call upon his Lord with the call of every detached, penitent and repentant one, saying:</p>
<p>O my Lord! I am he who transgressed against Thee and opposed Thy beauty, being occupied with my self and my desires, and verily Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O my Lord! When I recognized Thy Self, I sought Thy forgiveness for what I had been and for what appeared from my tongue and issued from my mouth and occurred to my heart, and I have turned unto Thee with my whole being, for verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. O my Lord! When Thou didst make me aware of the places of Thy Cause and didst awaken me from my sleep and heedlessness, I went forth from my house, turning toward Thy house, beholding the direction of Thy loving-kindness and Thy forgiveness, for verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. O my Lord! I have come to Thee with a sin heavier than what is in the heavens and earth, and greater than the creation of both worlds, until I stood before the gate of Thy house, from which no sinner hath ever been disappointed, and I prostrated myself upon its dust in humility before Thy beauty and in submission to Thy sovereignty and in lowliness before Thy presence. O my Lord! Have mercy upon me through Thy mercy and Thy grace, and assign me a seat of truth with Thee, and join me with Thy repentant servants. O my Lord! Forgive my transgressions and my sins and whatsoever my hands have wrought, for verily Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Then he shall raise his head and seek God’s forgiveness with this mighty and great prayer for forgiveness.</p>
<p>O Lord! I seek Thy forgiveness with my tongue, my heart, my soul, my inner being, my spirit, my body, my frame, my bones, my blood, and my skin. Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful. I seek Thy forgiveness, O my God, with such seeking of forgiveness through which the breezes of pardon waft upon the people of transgression, and through which the sinners are clothed in the robe of Thy gracious forgiveness. I seek Thy forgiveness, O my Sovereign, with such seeking of forgiveness through which the sovereignty of Thy pardon and grace is made manifest, and through which the sun of bounty and favor dawns upon the temples of the sinners. I seek Thy forgiveness, O my Forgiver and my Creator, with such seeking of forgiveness through which the erring hasten to the shore of Thy pardon and benevolence, and the seekers arise before the gate of Thy mercy, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. I seek Thy forgiveness, O my Lord, with such seeking of forgiveness which Thou hast made as a fire to burn away all sins and transgressions from every penitent, returning, remorseful, weeping, and pure soul, and through which the bodies of all created things are purified from the defilements of sins and misdeeds, and from all that is abhorrent to Thy Self, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Then let him enter the House with dignity and tranquility as though beholding God in the heaven of His command and the kingdom of His house, until he enters the courtyard and stands before the dome which was reserved for the establishment of the Throne of Glory thereon. Then let him raise his hands and turn his gaze toward the direction of His bounty and say: […]</p>
<p>I bear witness in this my station that there is no God but Him, alone without peer, without likeness, without equal, without opposite, without minister, without parallel, and without similitude. And that the Primal Point is His servant, His Glory, His Grandeur, His Majesty, His Divinity, His Might, His Sovereignty, His Power, His Dominion, His Authority, His Honor, His Nobility, and His Grace. Through Him did His Beauty shine forth, His Countenance appear, His Proof dawn, His Evidence become complete, His Argument perfected, and His Signs become manifest. Through Him were all who are in the heavens and on earth gathered together, and all who are in the kingdom of command and creation were raised up. Through Him the breezes of holiness wafted over all worlds. And I bear witness that He Whom God shall make manifest is the Truth, there is no doubt in Him, and He shall come with holy and exalted lights. Through Him shall the creation of the heavens and earth be renewed, and the creation of the first and the last. Blessed therefore is he who attains unto His time, enters His gate, is honored by meeting Him, circumambulates around Him, prostrates before Him, visits the dust of His feet, stands in His presence, and is among those who arise.</p>
<p>Then he says: O my Lord! This is Your House wherein have wafted the breezes of Your bounty and favor, wherein You have manifested in the mystery of mysteries through all the Manifestations of Your names and Dawning-places of Your attributes, and none has understood this save Your All-Knowing Self. O my Lord! This is Your House from which appeared the signs of Your grace to all worlds, and wherein befell You what befell from those who turned toward and those who turned away from You. And You did bear all this despite Your power and sovereignty. Verily, You are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O my Lord! This is the station wherein You walked with Your ancient feet, and wherein You raised Your voice and Your melodies, then Your call and Your sweet and wondrous trills. O my Lord! This is the station wherein You established Yourself upon the throne of all possible things and wherein You rose up with the sovereignty of Your power over all who are in the heavens and earths. O my Lord! This is the station wherein Your glance turned toward the direction of Your bounty and wherein the oceans of power surged in Your hidden, guarded, and protected Word. O my Lord! This is the station wherein Your Command was in the mystery of mysteries, and wherein Your lips moved not concerning what You willed, and wherein You concealed Your luminous face, and wherein You were in the unseen of the unseen and the veil of veils such that none among the worlds knew Your Self.</p>
<p>O my Lord! This is Your House which Your servants stripped bare after You, and they plundered what was in it and pillaged what was upon it, and thereby they violated Your sanctity and warred against You in their hearts and broke Your Covenant and shattered Your Testament. And You concealed all this and overlooked them through Your wondrous pardon. O my Lord! Strip me not of the beauty of Your concealment, remove not from me the mantle of Your care and forgiveness, distance me not from the vicinity of Your mercy, and deprive me not of the Kawthar of Your exalted grace.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Sanctify me from all else but You and draw me near unto Your Self and honor me with meeting You. Verily, You are the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Perceiving, the Resurrector, the Life-Giver, the Death-Dealer. O my Lord! Enable me to achieve what You have willed for Your near servants, then ordain for me the best of what You have ordained for Your holy chosen ones.</p>
<p>Then let him settle into stillness within himself and become quiet in his being, then turn with his heart and hearing toward the direction of the House. Should he perceive the fragrance of God and hear His call, he may be certain within himself that God has absolved him of his sins, overlooked his transgressions, and accepted his repentance. He will find himself as on the day he was born of his mother. But if he does not perceive the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, let him repeat this practice on this day or another day until he does perceive and hear it. This is what hath been ordained by the Pen of might and wisdom upon the preserved tablets of holiness. Thus doth God open the gates of grace and bounty upon the face of the heavens and earth, that perchance the people may not deprive themselves of God’s mercy and outpouring. This, verily, is guidance and a reminder from Us unto all the worlds.</p>
<p>O Letter of Ha! Hearken unto what God calleth thee to in this Prison, and turn not to anything else. Put thy trust in Him, then enter upon the shore of the Most Great Name. Know thou that as We answered thee before, so do We counsel thee in this Tablet that thou mayest take counsel within thyself and become aware of that which is hidden from the eyes of the world. By God! We desire naught in this save to purify thee from the veils of imitation and cause thee to enter this exalted and impregnable Paradise, that thou mayest behold things with thine own eyes and recognize God’s greatest treasure in this mighty Word. Say: By God, O people! I am but a servant of God and His Glory, and I call you unto God and unto that which hath been sent down from Him. I ask no recompense from you, and God is sufficient witness between me and you. Beware lest ye oppose him who hath come to you with God’s verses and wisdom. Fear God and His laws, and be not of the transgressors. Follow the religion of God and His Faith, and dispute not concerning that which hath been sent down unto you, and be of the God-fearing.</p>
<p>Arise then, O servant, and make up for what hath passed thee by, that God may forgive thee through His bounty and clothe thee in the robe of glorious honor. Leave the world and all that is in it and upon it in thy shadow, then soar in the atmosphere of the spirit and fear not the polytheists. First, detach thyself, then summon the people unto detachment, that thy word might influence the hearts of the heedless. Sanctify thyself from the world, then bid the people to sanctify themselves from it. Thus doth the Dove counsel thee, if thou be of them that act. By God, O servant, wert thou to inhale from this Shirt which We have sent with the hands of the heralds through these words, thou wouldst surely find from it the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Self-Sufficient, the Gracious, and thou wouldst detach thyself from the kingdom and all that is therein, and wouldst enter the Egypt of certitude while being heedless of all who dwell on earth. And thou wouldst bear witness through this Tablet as God hath borne witness unto Himself by Himself in the kingdom of His Cause that there is no God but Him and that Ali is His servant and His Glory unto all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>And thou, O Muhammad, when thou hast completed thy proclamation in Our name, seek out there the one named “Al-Habib” and make mention of him from Us and give him glad tidings from Our presence, that he may rejoice in his soul and be among those who are joyful. Say: O servant, give thanks unto God for having attained His presence and won His meeting and for being among the victorious, though thou didst not recognize Him when thou wert seated before Him. Yet God accepted thy obedience and ordained for thee in the Tablet a great reward. By God! Wert thou to discover what hath been ordained for thee, thou wouldst soar with longing. But this hath been veiled from thee and from the eyes of all the world by a wisdom that was in thy Lord’s knowledge, which none hath comprehended save His own Self. This is a revelation from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Then make mention of the loved ones there, both female and male, both young and old. Then remind them of these days wherein the Nightingale of Holiness warbleth in His final days, and remember them with holy and sublime remembrances. Say: O people! Desist from that which ye have been forbidden, transgress not the bounds of God, and exceed not what ye have been commanded in the Book. Fear God and be not among the losers. Then gather ye together upon God’s Cause and His Word, differ not in anything, ascribe no partners unto God, and be among the believers in His unity. Thus have We decreed for you and for those who have fulfilled their vows and were communities like unto you, that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Single, the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent. And when ye gather in your assemblies, remember Our grief and what hath befallen Us, then Our imprisonment in this land wherein Our devoted servants have been forbidden to enter.</p>
<p>Then know, O Muhammad, that We have made this Tablet a living, vital spirit, that thou mayest breathe it upon every land and city according to thy capacity, lest harm or weariness touch thee. Work thou according to what thou hast been commanded, to the extent of thy strength, and weary not thyself beyond thy capacity, and be thou in sure and secure protection. Then know that there hath come before Us a letter from thee wherein thou didst mention the names of those who honored thee on thy return from the presence of Beauty by God’s command, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And thereby have We been pleased with them and recorded their names in a Tablet wherefrom not an atom’s weight of the deeds of all creation shall be lost, that they may thank God within themselves and remember Him throughout their days and be among the thankful. Thus have We bestowed Our mercy upon thee and upon them, a mercy from Our presence for them and for Our righteous servants.</p>
<p>Then give thanks unto God within thyself that We have made thee a bearer of this most great bounty and chosen thee to proclaim it unto all the worlds. And thereby have We bestowed Our favor upon thee and upon thy soul and spirit and upon thy forebears, until it reacheth unto the First Creation. And this, verily, is a manifest bounty. Know thou thy station in this and in what We have given thee to drink of the wine which God hath made a light, then a spirit, then a delight for those who drink thereof. Be thou steadfast in what thou hast been commanded and waste not what hath been ordained for thee. And if joy toucheth thee in this Cause, give thanks unto God thy Creator, and if grief befalleth thee, be patient and maintain a beautiful patience. Verily God will fully reward those who are patient in His path, seeking His good-pleasure, and He neglecteth not the reward of the doers of good. We have arranged this Tablet in most excellent arrangement for thee and for whomsoever God desireth for Himself, and this is the most excellent bounty from Us to Our believing servants. And mercy be upon thee and upon all who believe in God and in what hath been sent down from His presence in holy and luminous Tablets. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>=== END BH00071 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00072 ===</p>
<p>In His Name, exalted be His glory, His majesty and His power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who uttered a Word in the world concerning which the factions differed in its meaning: some understood from it concealment, some supposed from it the decree of revelation, some recognized in it steadfastness, some found in it the fragrance of oneness, some perceived in it the scent of union, and others the path of error. Glorified be our Lord Who is sanctified above all that they have understood, for all words return to their like and are bounded by their limitations and referred back to themselves. Meanings are only known through words which God has made as their garment, yet they befit not their Creator and their Sovereign. The servant testifies that there is none other God but Him, and this is a word which God has made the mightiest pillar for the people of faith. Whoso acknowledges it has acknowledged what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Book and confessed what the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken in the return. Prayers and peace be upon the Guide of ways and the Sovereign of Messengers, Who was a bearer of glad-tidings to the righteous and virtuous and a warner to the wicked and the infidels, through Whose appearance the decree of the sword was manifested and paradise was ordained beneath His shade. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to have mercy upon His servants and to lift the decree of the sword from among His creation, and to aid them in that which will unite their hearts and souls, and to grant them that which will profit them and make them independent of all else. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice unto your remembrance! There has reached the servant that which he found like unto an ocean whereon sailed the ships of meanings and utterance with the banners of letters and words, wherein were treasured the pearls of wisdom and explanation. When I attained, witnessed, read, found and knew, I soared on wings of certitude to the station and presented it before the Countenance, and the Lord - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - said: O Zayn! Ever has the mention of your turning to the Most Holy Court been present. We beseech God to grant you success in visiting the Sacred House of God. O Zayn! One House was built by the Friend, and the other was built by the Glorious One. The first, He entered not therein, and from the second, He departed not. This is what We uttered last year to the messenger who was named Khalil. Should God will, He will draw you nigh unto Him and ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of the first life. If wisdom permits and the loved ones of that land become not divided, and the journey takes place with joy and fragrance, then set forth, placing thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Verily, We make mention in this station of Muhammad who has ascended unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to forgive him and absolve from him that which befitteth him not, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. We testify for him that he turned to the Supreme Horizon and witnessed the unity of God and His singleness, and believed in Him on a day wherein the polytheists had surrounded the cities of the unitarians. O Zayn! Verily, We make mention of everyone who has turned unto God, and this mention benefits him as the lamp benefits in the night and the sun in the day.</p>
<p>O God of Names! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Encompassing over all things, and by the breezes of Thy Revelation and the fragrances of Thy inspiration, and by the splendors of the lights of the daybreak of Thy bounty, that Thou forgive those who have ascended unto Thee, both men and women, until they reached Thy presence. Verily, Thou art He by Whose Name the ocean of forgiveness surged and the fragrance of grace wafted among all possibilities. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the dawn of union hath broken and the veil of separation and estrangement hath been rent asunder. Separation hath been transformed into meeting. In the midst of sorrow, the star of joy hath risen and the moon of gladness hath become manifest. As the Arabs say, “Congratulations to you! Come! Come!” A hundred thousand thanks to God, exalted be His glory, that this word “Come,” which had long remained concealed, hath today been made manifest. However, order must be maintained in that land. The friends must act with wisdom, even as is done in this land. The world of humanity dwelleth in peace and tranquility through harmony and forbearance; otherwise, each day witnesseth fresh strife and conflict. This evanescent one beseecheth and imploreth the Most High to remove rancor and hatred from the world and to transform discord into concord and estrangement into unity. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty over all things.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning a certain person who hath shown love and desired to come: say unto him that the idolaters of the world would not approve of such a visit, and the monotheists–that is, the divines of Persia–after having proclaimed for years that there is no God but God, ultimately pronounced their verdict against the Manifestation of Divine Unity. With their tongues they say “He doeth what He willeth,” yet at every moment they voice some objection or opposition. Until now, the fragrance of true unity hath not in truth been inhaled. “We are God’s and to Him shall we return.” Under these circumstances, that person’s visit and attention to these matters might cause him harm. If he is still living, convey to him, as bidden, Our greetings and make Our excuses. They were told: We have appeared for the purpose of meeting and We are the Guide, but the heedless have become as barriers. Verily, God loveth the patient ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon him be the peace of God, this servant sends greetings to him in the land of Sin-Lam and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to grant him steadfastness. O beloved of my heart! The cawers have gone forth cawing in the land of Sad, and they will surely go to Ardakan and Najafabad as well. Mulla Ja’far of Kirman and his sons have appeared with unprecedented deceit, exactly like the abominable Shi’ihs, repeating the same old arguments. They have not caught the slightest fragrance of this Day. You should write in detail to the land of N-J-A-R and write: O friends of Truth! Reflect upon the deeds, actions and beliefs of the Shi’ihs - what was their fruit and what was their outcome? The result of their beliefs and deeds was that they pronounced judgment against the Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for His sake, and martyred Him with such tyranny that all things wept. “The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers!”</p>
<p>Write to Zayn to write to the land of Nun and Jim and its surroundings: O people! Fear God and follow not the sources of conjecture and idle fancy. Today all must be set ablaze with the fire of divine love - a blaze that will ignite all the peoples of the world. Be ye strong in the Cause of God and His love. The corruption of the world hath appeared from the turbaned ones of those parts. Reflect upon Jabulqa and Jabulsa. They prided themselves on being Shi’ihs while in God’s estimation they were lower than dogs, for each day they would add to their turbans, say one qirat, while engaging in lies, a whole chest full, and cursing each other from the pulpits, heedless that all were in the fire and unmentioned before God. The Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for His sake, hath said that not a single one of the Shi’ihs became aware - may God silence them! Each day they occupied the people with lies and idle fancies, moved by their own base desires.</p>
<p>The people of the Bayan are observed to be like those souls. Though they had no knowledge from the beginning of the Cause, they have claimed awareness. At times they speak of the successor, at times of the mirror, and at times of the guardian, occupied with the same old utterances. Whatever fruit the misguided Shi’ih sect tasted, these souls shall taste as well. They have followed vain imaginings and perceive not; they have turned away from the truth and know not; they have violated God’s Covenant and Testament and understand not. Had that blessed Cause appeared in these lands, all would now be seen as they ought to be. Their beginning is conjecture and their end is idle fancy. The Cause is in the hands of God, the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>O people of God! When a cawer comes to you, leave him to himself. Draw not near unto him. This is My counsel unto you, both before and after. And if you do meet them, every cawer should behold from your faces such steadfastness that he would be powerless to turn away or object.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! They desire to measure by the standard of their own idle fancies the King of existence Who hath brought that which equals all divine books, nay rather exceeds them. At times they cling to the Bayan and at times to vain imaginings, although the Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for His sake, hath said: “He shall not be asked about My signs nor about what was revealed in the Bayan.” Observe how exalted is the Cause!</p>
<p>Consider the loftiness of the Cause and the baseness of the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. In accordance with the command, apprise the friends of the deceit and trickery of the croakers, and counsel them on behalf of the Truth to ponder the deeds, actions and beliefs of the misguided Shi’ih sect, and likewise their fruits. Should any soul reflect upon these, he would find himself steadfast in the Cause of God. The fruits of those souls were that, by the unanimous verdict of the leaders, they martyred the Lord of the world, and in every land they shed the blood of the friends of Truth. Say: O party of God! This is the day of true unity. Fix your gaze upon the horizon of God alone, and keep your hem pure from the thorns and thistles of the past and future.</p>
<p>The honored friend Aqa Mirza Habibu’llah, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], God willing, will return to Kirmanshah. The heedless souls of that land have no knowledge of the Cause, for at first the idolaters cast their calumnies - some regarding the oppression of the Point, some regarding his being a mirror and vicegerent, and some regarding his knowledge and understanding. Yet any fair-minded person would testify that he was ever in a state of security and perfect comfort, and always had multiple wives with him. His oppression that they mention - the martyrdom of the Dayyan, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah] the Most Glorious, calling him the father of evil, and likewise calling one whom the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - addressed “O My friend” in the Tablets until the end of His words, the father of calamities, passing verdicts against him and his like, usurping the authority of the Point, martyring one of the cousins and his like - all these matters and fleeing from land to land merely upon hearing a word, all were counted as oppression by the oppressors. And the arising of the Desired One before the faces of the world, and His endurance of afflictions and trials and imprisonment, were regarded by those souls as tyranny, although whatsoever He ordains is truth and whatsoever appears from Him is truth. Glory be to God! They have not yet understood the station of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.” I beseech God to grant success that all may be freed from the conditions of self and passion and soar with the wings of freedom in this vast divine atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Muhammad, upon him be God’s peace, and his petition was noted. It was presented before His countenance and He said: O Zayn! Convey greetings to him on behalf of the Wronged One and say: O Muhammad! This is the day of steadfastness and the day of service. The very foundation of the unitarians is shaken by the onslaughts of the idolaters and hearts are perturbed. Today consider the unitarians as a body - each day a portion of it is taken, yet none has yet discovered the cause and reason thereof. By God’s life! The cause has been deeds and conduct. We beseech God to aid all to cleanse their outward members through ablutions and their hearts through the water of return, and to cling with pure and mighty hands to the hem of the Most Merciful’s bounty, that perchance they may remain preserved from these trials. Glory be to God! They witness calamity yet strive not to remove it, and know not by what cause it came and by what means it may be lifted. The command is in God’s hand - He unveils and He covers, and He is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And likewise mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Isma’il and his supplication was presented before the Presence. This is what was revealed in reply: “O Isma’il! Jinab-i-Zayn conveyed thy petition. We beseech God to aid thee to that which is pleasing unto Him and to ordain for thee that which is best for thee.”</p>
<p>And mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Husayn from the people of Sh. It was presented and He said: “O Husayn! This Wronged One counseleth thee to steadfastness. The atheists are many and without number. Forget not the divines of the past who, despite their claims to knowledge and complete piety, pronounced the death sentence upon the most excellent of creation. We beseech God to make thee steadfast in such wise that the intimations of the people shall not debar thee from the Truth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.”</p>
<p>And He said: “Whosoever requesteth mention from you, make mention of him on behalf of the Wronged One and show kindness unto him, that all may rejoice and occupy themselves with the praise of God.”</p>
<p>The second missive from His Holiness, dated the 3rd of Rajab, delighted the ears with the warbling of the doves of inner meaning and brought to the heart the joy of the people of the Most Glorious Paradise. For the eyes it was true antimony, fashioned from the jewels of love and affection. After its reading and perusal, and after drawing from the living waters of love flowing through its letters and words, it was brought to the Sacred Presence and presented before His countenance. He said: “O Zayn, upon thee be the peace of God and His grace! Remove not the monotheists from thy sight. Pray for them, that the True One, exalted be His glory, may protect them and their cities from the evil of the fire and the hosts of the polytheists.</p>
<p>“O Zayn! Had the monotheists truly clung to the hem of the resplendent Law, the kindled lamp would not have been extinguished nor accepted extinction - a lamp by whose light the entire world was illumined, yet which was extinguished by the winds of self and desire. How many streams have the thieves carried away from that Most Great Ocean - some claiming truth, some in the name of the Path, some in the name of the esoteric, and some in the name of the essence of the esoteric. In any case, the mighty party was seen to be weakened by division, such that cities and lands were laid waste.</p>
<p>“In Kaf and Ra, which was mentioned in the Most Holy Book in the early days of imprisonment, the opposers have raised the standard of discord through calumnies the like of which have never been heard since the beginning of the world, and through deceptions never before witnessed, exerting their utmost effort to lead the people astray.</p>
<p>“O Zayn! Praise be to God that in days when day could not be distinguished from night, We summoned with utmost power and might before the faces of the world with the most exalted call, until in every city and land, nay in every village, the mention of the True One, exalted be His glory, was raised. Now that some light has appeared, they have emerged from behind their veils. We have no complaint; the purpose is to proclaim the Cause of God. By My life! If there were one worthy of mention, this Wronged One would choose silence. The station of which He said ‘If He should appear at this time, I would be the first to worship Him,’ and before whom all the Bayan was considered but as a leaf - from Him they have turned away, clinging to their own desires.</p>
<p>“O Zayn! Through nights and days the Supreme Pen alone rendered assistance. All bear witness to this, and not for a moment did it turn to self-preservation. Tribulations rained down like torrential rain and afflictions flew like the arrows of the polytheists. Nevertheless, the call was not cut short and the Pen did not choose silence. The Point of the Bayan has said that in the year nineteen, all who are in the Bayan should write books to each other proving He Whom God shall make manifest. His purpose was that all should be occupied with this Most Great Remembrance through tongue, hand, pen and heart, lest the people of the Bayan should act like the Shi’ih sect. However, His counsels produced the opposite effect in most of the hearts of the opposers of the Bayan. We leave them in their idle play.</p>
<p>“O Zayn! Repeatedly has this most sublime word flowed from the Supreme Pen: ‘I was asleep when the breezes of the mercy of my Lord, the All-Merciful, awakened Me and commanded Me to raise the call between earth and heaven. This is not from Me but from Him,’ and through verses […]”</p>
<p>By heaven! This is not from me but from Him, and through verses and clear proofs it is evident that if any fair-minded person were to compare the Kitab-i-Aqdas, which was revealed at the beginning of imprisonment, with the books possessed by the deniers, the radiance of the Word would shine forth like the sun and be proven. Should this word “I was asleep” until its end, along with the verses and clear proofs that have filled the world, be rejected or accepted? And this word was mentioned only in consideration of the weakness of the servants. Countless sovereign verses were revealed concerning the Kitab-i-Aqdas, most of which were not recorded. In any case, beseech the Truth to grant fairness and confirm all, that perchance they may attain the fragrance of the garment and recognize its Source. Now they have risen up with schemes and plots against the friends of Truth. Have such deeds ever been among the attributes of the people of truth? No, by My life! We beseech Him, exalted be He, to grant them what He possesses and not to make them among those who have corrupted and led others to corruption, who have gone astray and led others astray. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>One is bewildered as to what to mention and what to submit. This servant never imagined that the people of the Bayan would so quickly and severely rise up in rejection and objection. The Shi’ihs never committed what this group has perpetrated, nor did they say what this party has said and continues to say. Where has justice gone? This ephemeral one is perishing, for he observes that the deniers have turned away from the Truth and are unaware, or they recognize God’s favor yet deny it. In one respect, it is seen that the effulgences of the Sun of Truth have encompassed the world - how then have some remained veiled? However, in light of the blessed verse of the Furqan which states, exalted be His Word: “And it increaseth nothing for the wrong-doers save destruction,” one becomes silent and at rest, and commits all affairs to the Truth, glorified be His majesty. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the spiritual beloved, Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of Power - through boundless grace and favor, and the confirmation and success granted by the Truth, glorified be His majesty, he crossed land and sea until he arrived at the shore of the Most Great Sea. The favors and kindnesses shown to him were evident and manifest. He arrived and his sight attained its purpose of creation, and likewise his hearing and heart - he saw and heard and was occupied with the mention of God. Now he dwells at rest beneath the glances of grace. We beseech the Truth, glorified be His majesty, to confirm him and make him the source of great services. After this matter was submitted before the Lord, He said: “O Zayn! We ask God to confirm him, grant him success, and enable him to arise in service to the Cause - an arising that no sitting down can overtake, and that the authority of ignorant divines cannot prevent. Now that he has, praise be to God, been successful and adorned with the ornament of acceptance, it is hoped that he will hold fast to wisdom, speak for God’s sake, and remain turned toward God. Peace be upon him and glory be upon him.” And what was with him has arrived, of seeds and other things.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning Zare’ and those authorized souls, I beseech God to grant them all the blessing of pilgrimage to the House, and perchance this servant too may be gladdened and cheered by attaining their presence. In truth, those souls who move for the sake of God and hold fast to the commandments of His Book are accounted as stars in the heaven of grace. All atoms beseech God to grant success to such souls. The hardships of the way and the trials of the path do not deter them. These are the servants concerning whom He saith: “No fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.”</p>
<p>And petitions were received from Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Isma’il, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad, upon them be God’s peace. After being presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, He said: “O Zayn, Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Isma’il has, praise be to God, repeatedly attained and succeeded in visiting the House. Write to him on behalf of the Wronged One: ‘O Isma’il! Upon thee be My loving-kindness. Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One and thy name hath been uttered from His tongue. It is as though We behold thee standing at the door. Thy petition and letter - all that thou didst send - was seen and renewed thy mention. We beseech God to grant thee success in that which will cause the exaltation of His Cause. The friends of God who have drunk from the cup of love and soar in the atmosphere of longing and yearning must hold fast unto wisdom and cleave unto that which will bring glory to the Cause. We have mentioned thee before and after, and We shall mention thee if God should will and desire.’ And He said to write to Jinab-i-Asad, upon him be My loving-kindness: ‘We give thanks unto God for having bestowed upon thee the privilege of visiting His House and making thee among those who circle round it and hold fast unto what is in His Book. He forgets not those who have turned to Him and acted according to His command. His is the praise and the bounty that He hath enabled thee to attain that which hath been the hope of those near unto Him from before and after. Praise be to God, thou hast been and art mentioned. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and cleave unto His luminous hem. Thou hast ever been and art under His watchful gaze. If thou shouldst find a friend, convey the greetings of the Wronged One and counsel him to act with propriety.’ Jinab-i-Siyyid, upon him be My glory, and you must counsel everyone you meet to conduct themselves with calm, dignity, trustworthiness, religiosity, chastity, submission, contentment and reconciliation, that perchance the dust and smoke of hatred and animosity may be dispelled and the light of unity may illumine all lands.” And He said: “We have made mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad. God willing, may he be confirmed and assisted in that which is befitting.”</p>
<p>This servant conveys greetings and praise to my honored master Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Isma’il, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]. God is witness that in most times I make mention of them, and likewise occasionally mention is made of them in the Most Holy Presence. The days of nearness and attainment to His presence shall never be forgotten. For some time this servant has not been able to reply to their letter, and this is due to the abundance of writing, of which they are aware, and responding to souls newly planted in the garden of inner meanings, that perchance they may attain to the lights of the Luminary of certitude and drink from the rivers of assurance. And to my honored beloved Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be God’s peace and favors, I send greetings. How blessed were those days when seekers gathered in the presence of their Heart’s Desire and nightingales assembled upon the branches of the Tree of nearness and reunion, warbling and singing. Whenever remembered, the heart attains renewed joy. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ever confirm that honored friend through the grace of the Most Great Name. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>The beloved of the heart, Jinab-i-Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny, arrived with petitions, but until now there has been no opportunity to present them. Tonight or tomorrow, God willing, they will attain the honor of being heard, and afterward the command is in God’s hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.</p>
<p>As regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Husayn Ibn’us-Sad, upon them both be God’s peace, that he is engaged in shoemaking and that God, exalted be His glory, has blessed him with prosperity, and that the equivalent of two nineteen mithqals of gold has accumulated with him, and he now desires to pay the Huququ’llah therefrom - these matters were submitted to His presence. He said: “O Zayn! Those souls who act according to the ordinances of the Book are accounted as the most exalted of creatures in the sight of God. There has never been any doubt that whatsoever shines forth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s command is purely for the wisdom and benefit of His servants. These small amounts are not worthy of mention, yet since he acts for the sake of God, it is beloved - even if it be but a single grain, it is the crown of all the harvests of the world. Give him glad tidings of My mention, My favor, and My acceptance, that he may rejoice and be amongst the thankful.” According to His command, three tumans of the mentioned Huquq were received from Jinab-i-Ustad ’Abdu’l-Karim, upon him be God’s peace. Half of the remainder He bestowed upon him, and the other half upon that honored one. Blessed are those souls who hold fast to the fear of God and are engaged in service. This ephemeral one beseeches God to assist His party, one and all, in serving His Cause. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>And as for what was asked about shop equipment that is necessary for work and trade - whether Huququ’llah must be paid on these or whether they fall under the rule of household furnishings - after submission before His presence, He said that the rule of household furnishings applies to them.</p>
<p>As for the mention of the son of Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali Nur, upon them both be Baha’u’llah’s peace, it was submitted and attained the honor of His hearing. His mention and that of the souls mentioned have flowed from the Pen of Glory. God willing, may they attain unto it and be set ablaze with such a fire that the barking ones shall not prevent them, nay, shall not even be able to make mention of them. Thus has spoken the Lord:</p>
<p>He is God, there is no God but Him!</p>
<p>O Zayn! Give glad tidings to My loved ones of My remembrance of them, My attention to them, and My turning toward them. The Pen has ever been occupied with mention of the friends of God. Today all atoms lament the oppression of this Wronged One, for there has befallen Him that which has befallen no one else. As if the people of the world were not enough, now the people of the Bayan have arisen in opposition. Instead of acceptance they show rejection, in place of turning toward they turn away, and at the time of submission they show denial. Well have they heeded the counsels of the Point! He says that the Tree of Affirmation becomes negation through turning away from Him. Observe what mention the Herald made in such greatness, and what the people of the Bayan have done. The rocks cry out, the clouds lament, and the eyes of the near ones weep. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to each of the souls mentioned and make mention of them. Some time ago We mentioned the Deputy and sent a brief Tablet. Now again mention has been made of the one bearing the name of God (66) M.H. and of the friends. We beseech God not to deprive any of them of the Most Exalted Word, for all that is witnessed shall return to nothingness, but the Word of God has been and shall ever be enduring. Blessed is he who has attained unto it, recognized its station, and held fast to the cord of love for it. Woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>And as for the mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Rajab-’Ali, upon him be God’s peace, this is what the tongue of the Lord has spoken:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed […]</p>
<p>O Rajab-’Ali! The world has been encompassed by the smoke of heedlessness - that smoke which was mentioned in the Tablets and about which people would inquire has appeared. These are souls who have arisen to oppose without any cause, and with the utmost deceit and cunning strive to lead poor souls astray. The dust of ignorance, like a disease of the eyes, has prevented them from beholding the effulgent rays of the Sun of Revelation. They have forgotten the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen and have erased the words inscribed in the Crimson Book. Beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to have mercy upon His servants. O Rajab, ask God that never again in the world may the likes of the Shi’ih arise - that is, that such unfairness and cruelty may not appear. They perpetrated injustices unprecedented and unparalleled. Now certain followers of the Bayan walk in the path of those souls and cling to their ways. Say: O my Lord! Protect us from the evil of every deceiver and schemer. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. Rejoice in My remembrance of thee and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>By the life of our Lord! If a soul were to comprehend, as it ought to be comprehended, the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen, he would become aware of the oppression inflicted upon the Blessed Being. At least if he cannot act as he ought, he should not engage in that which would kindle the fire. The servants must have mercy upon themselves and not make themselves the objects of divine wrath and anger. Most are unaware and cling to vain imaginings, and have neither sight nor hearing of their own. We are God’s and unto Him shall we return.</p>
<p>According to His command, it would be desirable if copies of the Tablet to Aqa Rajab-’Ali, together with the blessed utterances revealed in response to his second letter specifically for him, were sent to various regions, that perchance the people may take heed and recognize. It would also be desirable if Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Habibu’llah, upon him be God’s peace, were to make copies.</p>
<p>Regarding the several bound volumes that someone from Dawlatabad sent to your honor and which volumes have remained until now - what you wrote about this matter was presented. According to His command: let them remain for now. The Shaykh has not come and no news has been received from him.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the envelope addressed to the honored and beloved Haji Nabil-i-Musafir, upon him be the glory of God - if possible send it and write that it arrived some time ago but due to the disturbances its dispatch was delayed.</p>
<p>The mention of the spiritual friend Aqa Muhammad Hasan, upon him be God’s peace, was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. He said: We have not forgotten him and will not forget him. He has always been and continues to be remembered. This servant also sends greetings to him and beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may grant him his hopes and ordain for him from the Most Exalted Pen that which is the cause of joy and gladness. He said: We have mentioned Our Most Truthful Name as befits Him and beyond.</p>
<p>Your third letter, which was adorned with the date of the 22nd of the month of Sha’ban, gave new life to the spirit and bestowed fresh joy. Praise and thanksgiving be unto the peerless Lord that blessings arrive continuously […]</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of the ascension of the honored Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God and His forgiveness, which was written - this was presented at the Most Exalted Place, and this is what the Lord uttered: “O Zayn! We bear witness to his acceptance and his faith, and his confession of the blessed word ‘There is no God but God,’ and his recognition of that which was revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Divine Book. We beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to cleanse him of all imperfections with the water of His grace and to immerse him in the ocean of forgiveness.</p>
<p>“O my God! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bounty to forgive Thy servant who hath ascended unto Thee, and to remit his sins and transgressions. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they were repeatedly mentioned. This servant also beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, not to withhold from him the wonders of His grace nor deprive him from the ocean of His mercy.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Muhammad Husayn, son of the known one, upon them both be the Glory of God. After this was presented, He said: “O Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! We beseech God to ordain for thee what thou hast desired and to forgive thee through His grace, His generosity and His favors. Verily, He is the One Who hath power over what He willeth, and He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Kind.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the middle son of Aqa ’Ali-Nur, upon them be the peace of God - this was presented and He said: “O Zayn! Nur and his relatives have never been forgotten in the presence of the Wronged One. God willing, may they be assisted to that which will cause their eternal and enduring mention and preserve them from the evil of the barking ones. Today all must pray for one another and seek protection from the True One. Coming to this place at this time would be unwise, as many have come this year. The opposers are intervening and are heedless of what God hath willed. Each day they cling to a cord and grasp the hem of vain imaginings. May God grant justice and adorn the horizon of the world with the light of equity.”</p>
<p>[Mention was made of His Holiness the Name of God Jamal, upon him be all His Most Glorious Glory. He hath endured many hardships in the path of God and, praise be to God, hath attained unto the word of contentment. Continually from the blessed Tongue is heard concerning him that which is the greatest testimony to his humility, submissiveness, self-effacement and his arising to serve the Cause of God. If possible, your honor should convey this glad tiding to him.]</p>
<p>The stockings of the Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, which were sent through the beloved heart, the honored Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the praise of God, the Lord of Power, arrived at the Household. All showed the utmost appreciation, and each of the members of the pavilion of grandeur and glory sends special greetings. His Holiness the Name of God Asdaq, upon him be all His Most Glorious Glory, is adorned with wondrous mention upon the arrival of each letter from your honor. In truth, this time is the springtime of death, for its mention flows from the Supreme Pen. This evanescent servant conveys greetings, praise and glory to all the friends of that land, and beseeches from the True One, exalted be His glory, confirmation and success for each one. Verily, He is worthy of response and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Praise, remembrance and glory be upon your honor, upon those who are with you, and upon the sincere servants of God. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>He is God!</p>
<p>On the 9th of the honored month of Shawwal 1302:</p>
<p>Praise be to God! God’s grace has honored us with the fourth letter of Book Four. Each of the four elements and the four fundamentals received their full portion of its fragrances. Although in the view of later thinkers the elements have exceeded the number given by the ancients, knowledge is with God and the command is in His hand - He gives and withholds, He inspires and restrains, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>After reading and becoming informed, and after submitting this response, there appeared from the Kingdom of Utterance these words - exalted be His glory: “O Zayn! The dust and smoke of idle fancies and vain imaginings have encompassed all. The heedless and ignorant have clung to what they possess and remain deprived of what is with God. Four persons from the people of Manshad have sent a letter in opposition to God and in rejection of Him, and that letter bore witness to sheer ignorance and absolute tyranny. What was befitting as an answer has appeared from the Most Great Sea. If God should will it, your eyes shall be gladdened by beholding it. Glory be to God! How many heedless servants are to be seen! Thou shalt read and know the stations of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>Four persons from the people of Manshad sent a letter to the Most Holy Court and arranged according to their own desires that which befitted those heedless souls. Strange that the letter of those people was incomplete, meaning that due to the intensity of their hatred and animosity, they omitted the divine mention at its beginning. What was hidden in their hearts was revealed, for this is the Day when secrets are unveiled. Everyone is occupied with their own vain imaginings, save those whom God has willed otherwise.</p>
<p>The letter which this servant wrote in reply, containing divine utterances, is being sent so that your honor may observe it and become aware of the degrees of faith and certitude of some. The reply was sent to the Land of Ya to be delivered to Manshad. If your honor should make copies and send them to certain places, this would be acceptable in the sight of God. Perhaps the ignorant people will not again fall prey to the well of idle fancies and vain imaginings. The Command is in God’s hand, and He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Another submission: The response to your honor’s letters was written some time ago, but there was delay in sending them as other matters arose and other affairs occurred. Therefore, I hope for forgiveness. The travelers, upon them be God’s peace, arrived and what was with them was received. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He may grant each one a complete reward. Verily, He has power over all things. The Glory be upon you and upon your family.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>15th of the sacred month of Dhi’l-Hajjih 1302</p>
<p>[Since this appears to be a note about a text rather than the actual text to be translated, I am unable to provide a meaningful translation. Please provide the actual Baha’i text that needs to be translated.]</p>
<p>=== END BH00072 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00073 ===</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath caused the Sun to shine through His power, and hath made the Light to appear through His might, and hath illumined the Face in the vesture of His Cause through His wisdom, and hath caused the Dove to warble with a wondrous melody its divine song, and hath moved the thread of existence by that which hath been sprinkled upon it of the signs of His love, and hath kindled the lamp of love in the niche of His grandeur and the lamp of His mercy, and hath raised the banners of guidance through the power of His might, and hath made manifest the orbits of piety through the blessing of His exaltation. He is the Powerful, the Ever-Living, the All-Compelling, Who hath ever been the One Who uniteth His Essence in the eternity of His Essence, and Who exalteth His Being in the everlastingness of His Being. When He desired to make Himself known unto His servants and to manifest the signs of His power to all who are in His heaven and on His earth, He removed the veil from the beauty of His concealment and lifted the covering from the essence of His majesty, that thereby His manifest Name might be distinguished from His hidden Name, and His first Name might be differentiated from His last Name, that the word might be fulfilled in the unseen and the visible, in the hidden and the manifest, that He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and that He is cognizant of all things. Thereby did the Essence of Identity become manifest in the Temple of Lordship, and the Beauty of the Self-Subsisting shine forth in the Form of Divinity, and the Pre-existence was adorned with the robe of Eternity, and the Mystery of Divinity was repeated in the vestures of Beauty, and the heaven of Unity was raised up, and the earth of the Self-Subsisting was established, and the mountains of the Cause were exalted, and the seas of might were made to surge, and the Tree of spirituality brought forth fruit, and the Sun of Identity shone forth, and the Moon of the unseen rose, and the sanctified hearts found peace, and the pure souls were enraptured. Exalted is He above what His servants mention of Him or His creation describeth, for in the pure essence of His concealment and in the essence of His identity, He cannot be mentioned by His own mention nor described by His own description. How could it be otherwise, when mention proceedeth from another than Him or appeareth from His creation? Were this to be established, it would establish the station of mention from His Essence unto His Essence, and the limitation of description for His Self by His Self. He is sanctified from duality and exalted above similarity. Rather, He created all mentioned things through a letter of the word of His command, and brought all visible things into being through a design from the signs of His creation. Indeed, His Essence through His Essence is a mention of His Essence, and His Self through His Self is a description of His Self. When He desired to establish this, He manifested the hidden Identity in the two Names, and removed the veil of light from the two veils, and split the sun in the two aspects, and caused the Spirit to appear in the two vestures, and made the light to speak in the various modes of unity in the two melodies, and manifested the mystery of the Cause in the two letters, and gathered together the sun and moon in the holy temple in the two veils, and inserted the hand of power in the two garments, and caused the sun of Identity to appear from the two foreheads, that the lamp of unity might be repeated in the two lamps, and the lights of eternity might shine forth in the two glasses, and the radiance of the Self-Subsisting might appear upon the holy temples in the two forms, and the Dove might warble upon the two branches, and the ark of the cloud might sail upon the two seas, that the wondrous creation might be completed from the two Beauties in the two Most Exalted Names. Therefore say: O Generous One! Blessed be God, the Best of creators!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I know not by what remembrance to remember Thee. Should I remember Thee by what Thou didst remember aforetime, by Thy glory, this would never satisfy my soul. And should I describe Thee by what hath not been described before, this is that which Thy servants cannot bear. By Thy Countenance! At such time I find myself between two impossibilities among the forbidden things, and I become bewildered in my remembrance of Thee to such extent that I forget the ways of remembering Thee and lose the paths of describing Thee. I know not how I may thereafter arise to serve Thee and how I may raise the banners of Thy triumph amidst Thy creation. Should I glorify Thee, O my God, in the manner of Thy servants, this befitteth not Thy sovereignty nor is worthy of Thy glory. And should I sanctify Thee as beseemeth Thy right and Thy station, the servants would flee from around Thee and disperse from Thy presence.</p>
<p>Glorified, glorified art Thou! How great is my bewilderment in Thy Cause, and how mighty is my wonderment at Thy greatness! Therefore it behooveth that mysteries remain veiled in the clouds of light, that thereby he who cannot rend asunder the veils of glory may be prevented, and he who hath quaffed from the chalices of beauty may perceive it. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, that despite my bewilderment, my powerlessness, my perplexity and my perturbation, I desire to interpret that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy glory and brought into being in the kingdom of Thy command by Thy will, and inscribed by the Pen of Thy decree upon the Tablet of Thy determination, wherein Thou hast ordained Thy ordinances and confirmed that which Thou hast established in Thy Book and Thy decisive verses. This is so that the heart of one of Thy servants may find tranquility in that which Thou hast revealed unto Thy chosen ones and Thy trusted ones, that he may thereby enter the throne of mercy and assurance in the precincts of Thy mercy, and dwell upon the seat of steadfastness and certitude in the paradise of Thy favors. And that he may be among those who repose upon the carpet of Thy love, who drink from the chalices of Thy love, who are set ablaze with the fire of Thy oneness, and who seek tidings of that which Thou hast revealed unto them of Thyself, that perchance he may meet Thee in the throne of Thy identity, follow Thee in the vestments of Thine eternity, circumambulate the sanctuary of Thy grandeur, and seek the unseen of Thy beauty and the Kaaba of Thine Essence.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my God, manifest in his heart the passion for Thy beauty and the quest for Thy reunion, if he be assured in Thy Cause, submissive to Thy decree, yielding to Thy sovereignty, following Thy Countenance, obedient to Thy ordination and patient in Thy good-pleasure. Verily, Thou hast not created in all existence anything greater than this in what Thou hast ordained regarding the station of Thy servants.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee at this moment not to take me to task for what I have committed before Thee and what my hands have wrought before Thine eyes. Verily Thou knowest what is within myself and art encompassing what is in my inmost being. Thou dost witness and behold that I have chosen naught for myself save servitude unto Thee, and that I was but abased before the sovereignty of Thy might, poor before the manifestations of Thy wealth, athirst before the outpouring of the rivers of Thy mercy, weary before the melodies of Thy oneness, non-existent before the modes of the glory of Thy sovereignty, and extinct before the dawning of the sun of Thine eternity. I desire naught save the exaltation of Thy triumph in Thy land and the ascendancy of Thy name in Thy country.</p>
<p>Therefore, as I am thus, I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy glory which is never quenched, by Thy Face which never perisheth, by the light of Thine eternity which is never concealed even if hidden, and by the garment of Thy majesty which never weareth out, that Thou mayest send the winds of eternity from the right hand of Thy oneness and waft the breezes of glory from the horizon of Thy Self-Sufficiency, that thereby the dove of my breast may flutter in the throes of Thy love[…]</p>
<p>Let the breezes of might descend from the heaven of Thy oneness, that the dove of my heart may be drawn forth through the intensity of my love and nearness to Thee, and be stirred by the attractions of Thy reunion and meeting with Thee. Wherefore, O my God, how could I be content with that which Thy Self doth not approve, or desire that which the Dayspring of Thine Essence and the Source of Thy Beauty doth not desire? I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name to take hold of the reins of the Pen through Thy power, and to guide it as Thou willest through Thy might, lest there flow from it that which Thou lovest not to be manifested in Thy dominion and which Thy servants cannot bear. For verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O my God! Send down Thy blessings upon the first Sun that dawned from the horizon of the cloud of unknowing, and the first Light that shone from the Dayspring of heaven’s splendor, and the first Ocean that surged in the mystery of Thy Most Great Name, and the first Fire that appeared in the Tree of Eternity, and the first Love that was kindled in the Lamp of Fidelity, and the first Spirit that was breathed from the Sun of Guidance and the Center of Piety, and upon the first one who spoke of Thy most beauteous Beauty and the last one who drank the crimson cup from the Countenance of Eternity, and upon those who guided others unto Thee in the most great land and those who turned towards Thee in the most glorious realm, and upon Him Whom Thou didst raise up by Thyself in the station of His Cause, and didst choose from among Thy servants, and didst make Him the Sustainer of Thy sovereignty and the Guardian over the people of Thy kingdom and the One to be obeyed in Thy dominion, through all that Thou art capable of, for in Thy grasp is the kingdom of all things, and Thou art powerful over all things.</p>
<p>When I desired to answer the seeker who believed in God and His signs, and wished to attain certitude in His Cause and to ascend to its heights and be illumined by its glory and to take shelter under the shadow of His grace, I placed my trust in God and sought His aid and assistance in what I wished to mention, through His might and power, of that which was concealed within the pavilions of light and veiled within the coverings of joy and hidden in the secret repositories of manifestation, concerning that which was sent down from His presence regarding His Beloved and His Chosen One and the essence of His creation, that it might serve as a proof for those who desire to follow the true religion and seek guidance through His direction and illumination through His light and radiance through His effulgence and attraction through His attraction, even though this be far above my station and transcending my mind and understanding. Nevertheless, according to my weakness and lowliness and poverty and need, I mention that which God hath taught me through His generosity and shown me through His grace and honored me through His favor, that it might be a guide for those who turn unto Him and a light for those who seek Him and a radiance for those who are lonely.</p>
<p>This is what was sent down from the heaven of grandeur by the tongue of might and glory concerning His holy Mirror and Eternal Light: “O Thou Temple! We have created Thee upon these Most Beautiful Names and made Thee all things in the names of Him Who referreth unto Us through the mention of ‘He’, that Thou mayest be Our sign unto all the worlds.”</p>
<p>Hear thou, O questioner, from Me, and accept My counsel, for thou shalt find no friend more faithful than I, nor any companion more considerate. At the outset, array thy temple with the raiment of the spirit, and clothe thy form with the vesture of light. Sanctify thine eyes from all veils of otherness, and purify thine ears from dubious and vain utterances. Cleanse thy heart, illumine thy soul, and purify thy breast, that thou mayest be worthy to receive the effulgence of the Sun of Perpetuity and become fit to mirror forth the Moon of Eternity. Thus mayest thou hear and see how the Dove of Divinity warbleth upon the branches of the Tree of the Lord, and how the crimson Fire appeareth from this verdant Branch, and how the Water of Unity floweth through the Temple of Divinity. Then shalt thou enter the City of the Living, the Eternal, and abide therein throughout sempiternal immortality.</p>
<p>Know thou that God, blessed and exalted be He, addressed His Mirror in this verse revealed from His presence, saying: “O Fruit of Eternity, and Vesture of the All-Merciful, and Temple of the Ancient of Days, and Tree of the Self-Subsisting! We have created thee upon these Most Beautiful Names; that is, We have made thee the sum of all names that have appeared, risen, shone forth and dawned from the Supreme Kingdom and the Realm of Creation from among the Most Beautiful Names which We have attributed to Our Own Self.” For He, exalted be His mention, the names He hath attributed to Himself are from among the Most Beautiful Names and the Greatest Signs, such as Knowledge, Power, Life, Loftiness, Grandeur, Sovereignty, Glory, Might, Dominion, Mercy, Compassion, and similar names that have appeared in the vestures of expressions, allusions and evidences. God hath attributed these to Himself and made their manifestations from among the letters of the most exalted ones, the sanctified temples, the lights of the sincere ones, and the essences of those who glorify Him. These holy names have appeared in these abstract ethereal temples that all might derive their ranks from God, their Creator, their Fashioner, their Maker, their Resurrector, their Originator, and their Cause, that the horizons might be filled with the lights of that Radiance, and that the nightingale of the sanctuary might sing at the time of meeting, after being struck unconscious and recovering consciousness, that He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and that Ali is the source of His Essence, the mine of His knowledge, the repository of His Command, and the wellspring of His deed in all that hath appeared and shall appear, or hath been created and shall be created.</p>
<p>And apart from these names which are mentioned from among the Most Beautiful Names, He hath not attributed any to Himself, nor doth He attribute them to His Essence. Such hath been His way from before that which hath no before, and after that which hath no after. Otherwise, all names are but creation in His dominion, design in His realm, manifestations in His lands, attributes among His servants, signs in His earth, and evidences in His creation. Is there any creator besides God? Is there any originator besides God? Is there any created thing wherein are not found the signs of its Creator, or which doth not tell of the manifestations of its Fashioner? Exalted is He above what the servants say regarding the manifestations of His handiwork and the attributes of His creation. Thus hath God described His names for His servants and defined them for us through His bounty, and ordained them for us through His grace, that we might know the paths of truth and guidance from unbelief and error. We have no authority to change even a letter of our own accord, and there is no command except after His leave, and nothing whatsoever […]</p>
<p>By Him! There is nothing whose decree hath not been determined and whose measure hath not been ordained by Him, that the path of His Cause and the ways of His wisdom might be made easy for us to tread. Alas, alas! How can I remember what Thou didst desire of me, for it is as though I have forgotten all remembrance. O thou who questioneth! By the glory of my Lord, wert thou to discover my secret, thou wouldst weep over my state and wouldst not rest in thy home, but rather wouldst flee to the mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Concourse of the Bayan! Do not oppose him in whose heart there is naught but the effulgence of the lights of the morn of eternity. Fear God, oppose him not, neither slander him, nor exceed the bounds regarding him. Walk ye in the paths of God’s mercy, then tread the ways of His guidance. Rely on none save Him, seek no intermediary but Him, and follow naught except what hath been revealed unto you and ordained for you. Say: Verily, He is the Most Great Path, the Most Glorious Light, and the Most Exalted Spirit. Whoso obeyeth Him hath attained salvation and security, and whoso turneth away hath erred and disbelieved.</p>
<p>By thy life! Were the fragrance of love to waft from this eternal and goodly City, the heavens of knowledge would be obliterated, the earth of eternality would crumble, the sun of divine essence would darken, the fish of oneness would be disturbed, the mountains of holiness would be crushed, and the sweet waters would freeze. Therefore, hold fast unto this luminous handle, then enter the city of inner meanings that thou mayest inhale the spiritual fragrance from the divine vestments, that thou mayest be enlightened in the Cause of God, thy Lord, and recognize His station in all conditions, seeking illumination from the sun of His revelation, being content with His decree, and patient under His trials, such that thou art not saddened by what hath escaped thee or befallen thee in thy days.</p>
<p>O my brother! Seek God’s help, then turn wholly unto Him. Look not to anyone else, fear no soul, and be not troubled by anything, for verily the world and its ornaments, its bounties, its delights, and all that is in it, upon it, and through it shall perish - there is no permanence or duration in it. Leave it to its people and seek the goodly fruit that groweth upon a blessed and goodly tree, yielding its fruit at all times, neither failing nor diminishing, for its delights are everlasting and unceasing, its clusters near at hand and undenied, its lights radiant and undimmed, its fruit enduring and unfalling, its sun shining and uneclipsed, its moon luminous and undiminished, its spirit eternal, its fragrance pure, its taste perfect, and its glory ancient.</p>
<p>O thou who walkest in the path of glory and righteousness, and travellest on the way of thy Most Exalted Lord! If thou acceptest what We have counselled thee, thou shalt attain unto all that We have promised thee and witness what none before thee hath witnessed, if Satan preventeth thee not from the ways of the All-Merciful. Trust in God and fear not. Enter, by God’s leave, the city of thy heart in a moment of heedlessness from thyself and thy desires, that thou mayest witness the mysteries of Lordship in the temple of eternity and perceive every good thing from this luminous vestment. Blessed art thou, blessed art thou, if thou knowest that whereof We have informed thee and reapest from the green ears We have sown in the soil of allusions, lest the hardships of the matter seize thee in the barren days, that thou mayest be among those whose faces are illumined by God’s light and whose hearts are enlightened by God’s mercy.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my brother, cast off the garment of the old creation from thy temple, then don the robe of sanctity and the vesture of detachment. Cast away all that thou hast and all that is upon thee which veils thee from attaining the presence at the throne of eternity and prevents thee from entering the sanctuary of grandeur. Then empty thyself of all that the self desires.</p>
<p>Then free thyself from all that thy passions desire, and cleanse thy spirit with these waters which have flowed from the ocean of the divine cloud upon this luminous white tablet, that thy heart may be emptied, thy spirit find rest, thy mind be calmed, and thy soul be at peace. If thou hast ears, hear from Me; if sight, behold from Me; and if a heart, comprehend therefrom the light of thy Lord. Ascend thereby to the pivot of all journeys, and strip thy body of all garments, veils and allusions, that thou mayest be naked when thou meetest thy Lord and when thou attainest the Throne of Glory in the shelter of Beauty.</p>
<p>O my brother! By my Lord, I repeat my words to thee and renew what they contain for thee, that thy spirit, thy garment, thy robe, thy body and thy soul may be renewed, despite my weakness and lack of patience and forbearance in occupying myself with such deceptive words and ornate letters. It is as though I had committed every sin before God, my Lord. When I find in my heart love for His Essence, passion for His Beauty, and yearning for His Being, I mention Him to the extent that thou findest and knowest. Otherwise I could not speak or express myself. How can I speak after my mouth has been struck by the hands of hatred and hypocrisy, and after what has befallen me which none can comprehend or reckon? Every spear has pierced my breast, every sword has fallen upon my head, and every arrow created has struck my liver.</p>
<p>Despite all this, how can this divine Bird soar in the garden of inner meanings, and how can it gather the jewels of knowledge from the divine scriptures? It is as though I were veiled by seventy thousand veils of darkness and remained bewildered in my affair, to the point where I wore the garment of ignorance among the servants lest anyone in the land recognize me. Perchance they would lift their hands from my head. I sat in the house and relied upon God, saying: O people of the Concourse! Is there any helper who will help me? Any merciful one who will show me mercy? Any companion who will keep me company? Any helper who will ward off from me the evil of the corrupt ones and close the doors of hypocrisy in my face?</p>
<p>Then, when I found no helper for myself to share in my tribulation and accompany me in my weeping, I desired to weep by myself for myself, to lament by myself for myself, to cry out for my deprivation, to shout for my oppression, and to scream for my abasement until naught remained of me, neither thing nor trace nor fruit. Perchance God will raise up one who will love me and desire me and read my words and weep for my condition, for upon Him is my reliance, through Him is my beseeching, from Him is my request, and to Him are my supplications, my entreaties, my cries, my lamentations and my poverty.</p>
<p>Know then, O questioner, that the Name hath diverse ranks, stations, indications and significances. In one station, naught is witnessed in the Name save the effulgence of the Named One. In another station, it is identical with the Named One, His reality, His self and His essence. In yet another station, it is other than the Named One. In one station it points to the Named One, and in another it circles round the Named One. For each of these there are ranks, manifestations and dawning-places, all of which move within the lands of His Command and walk in the paths of His Will and proceed along the ways of His doing. For each there are measures with thy Lord and appointed times with thy Creator in that which He hath ordained and decreed by His leave.</p>
<p>In one station the Names are the garment of the attributes, for the attribute is an act that appeareth from the Doer, such as the giving of a thing or the ascendancy of one thing over another, and likewise whatsoever appeareth from the Doer in the ranks of His Will and Power. This act appeareth from the effect of the deed that proceedeth from the Doer. And when God desired to manifest this in His kingdom and make it known in His earth and prove it in His lands and make it an enduring word and a clear sign, He clothed it in the garment of Names, even as ye say “This one is generous” and “This one is seeing” and “This one is informed” and such other names as are uttered and mentioned in the tongues of the people of creation. Were it not designated by these names it would not be known, nor would it appear and become manifest.</p>
<p>Know thou likewise all scientific matters through these finite veils, that the mysteries of destiny in the worlds of divine decree may be revealed unto thee. If thou wert to rend asunder the veils and focus thy vision upon the disclosure of limitations, thou wouldst witness that the Names are non-existent in the rank of the Divine Essence and are null at the dawning of the Countenance of Attributes in the Manifestations of Signs and Daysprings of Tokens. Rather, all names exist through His Will and all attributes are raised up through His Purpose, and all circle round His Essence and revolve in the heaven of His sanctity.</p>
<p>Therefore, O thou who seeketh and walketh the path, drink from this cup which hath been filled through the loving-kindness of God’s mercy, lest thirst overtake thee in the eternity of God’s dominion. And shouldst thou say “Is there yet more?”, this is the condition of one who is still on the path; otherwise, whoso hath reached the Pole of the Divine Ipseity and the Center of the Unseen shall not distinguish between beginning and end, nor between thirst and quenching.</p>
<p>His word, exalted be His mention: “We have made thee all things in Our Name which pointeth unto Us through the mention of ‘He’” - that is, We have caused thy light to shine in all things and have deposited the sign of thy power in all things and have made thee manifest above all things in this Garment of Divine Unity which speaketh of naught save God, the Lord of creation and humanity, that all may worship their Creator on this Straight Path and this Ancient and Lofty Way.</p>
<p>He, glorified and exalted be He, hath made His mirror all things that exist through His existence, such that in all things naught is witnessed save the sign of the effulgence of that Mirror which indicateth and reflecteth. Were it not for Him, the decree of thingness would not be established for anything [and] the decree of existence; rather, the decree of non-existence and nullity would be true of it, and nothing would accept anything except through obedience to Him. For example, if today thou wert to worship God with all thy power and all thy might and prostrate thyself to Him from the eternal past to the eternal future […]</p>
<p>Know that all things prostrate themselves before Him from the beginning that has no beginning to the end that has no end, and until thou believest in Him thy faith shall not be complete, nor shall the word ‘faith’ be applicable to thee, nor shall the term ‘certitude’ be befitting of thee. And know thou that when God, blessed and exalted be He, created the heavens and all that dwelleth therein, and the earth and all that existeth thereupon, He chose from all that He hath created and will create this celestial Pearl, this heavenly Spirit, this all-embracing divine Word, this eternal and singular Light, and made it to occupy the station of all things when it believed in God and submitted to His presence and bowed down before His majesty and prostrated before His sovereignty and spread the wings of acquiescence to His command. It is as though all existence believed in God and His signs, for existence cannot be attributed save to this divine Temple, and if none besides Him among the dwellers of earth and heaven were to believe, it would detract naught from His sovereignty, and if all were to believe in Him, it would add naught thereunto. For this reason was it revealed aforetime: “If ye show ingratitude, ye and all who are on earth together, yet verily God is Self-Sufficient, All-Praised.” By my Lord! Now it is as it hath ever been - thou wilt find no change or alteration in His ways. Then know thou that in this primordial and eternal verse God hath ordained all names in all things, and hath limited all things to the name “He”, and hath assigned to that name an outward and an inward aspect. Its outward aspect betokeneth the Temple of Divinity, the Form of Lordship, and the Garment of Eternity, while its inward aspect betokeneth the Unseen Essence, the Mystery of Oneness, and the Ancient and Pure Reality. He hath expressed the inward through the letter “H” and the outward through the letter “V”, and when He desired to manifest His beauty in the kingdom of His glory, He established this hidden and ancient “H” upon that celestial and eternal Temple. Thereupon was perfected the beauty of the Divine Essence in the form of Light, and was completed the wondrous creation in the robe of grandeur. He made this Name the greatest of all names, the most exalted, the most glorious, the most subtle, and the most elevated, such that He made it a mirror of all names and attributes, that all might derive sustenance through it unto God, be illumined by its light, be guided by its guidance, walk in its good-pleasure, and circle round its presence. And thou, O questioner, when thou dost inhale at this moment the fragrance of the spirit from the garment of eternity and dost smell the sweet scents from the city of the cloud of unknowing, in that We have called thee to the right side of the shore, to the right of the spot of unity, and have turned thee from the left of limitation to the mountain of eternity, thou shalt witness all names and attributes circling round that Most Great Name, and shalt know all things beneath the shadow of this Most Ancient and Most Upright Symbol, and shalt behold the seas of names and attributes moving beneath its shadow, such that there is no beginning to their first and no end to their last. All glorify His name and sanctify His being and circle round His essence and revolve about His presence, and there existeth nothing either in the heavens or on earth save that it abideth beneath the shadow of one of His names. For instance, when thou perceivest knowledge from one possessed of knowledge, thou art assured that this knowledge hath appeared through the influence of God’s name, the All-Knowing, and when thou beholdest power from one possessed of power, thou knowest that this power hath been derived from the effects of His name, the All-Powerful. Likewise is the elevation of heaven beneath the shadow of His name, the Most High […]</p>
<p>And likewise the loftiness of heaven existeth beneath the shadow of His exalted Name, and the radiance of the sun beneath His illuminating Name, and the stillness of earth beneath His tranquil Name, and the flow of water beneath His flowing Name, and the blowing of wind beneath His dispatching Name. Therefore, O thou who art seated upon the Ark of divine favor, drink of this sweet and life-giving wine, then soar with wings of ruby unto the Throne of Glory, that thou mayest comprehend all principles through this universal divine principle, making every path easy for thee. For if thou canst ascend from this earthly homeland to the divine original homeland, thou wilt hear the melodies of this eternal Bird, how it singeth like the Dove in the supreme Kingdom, that thou mayest delight in the feast which descendeth from heaven at that time. Know thou that God hath gathered all essences, signs, substances, meanings, attributes, names, realities and expressions in a woven garment, and clothed that divine and holy Temple therewith, that this garment might tell of the beloved Joseph. And if thou desirest that the matter be made clear unto thee with utmost lucid explanation and supreme certain exposition, know thou the station of these divine letters which in their similitude are like unto the station of the lamp. For even as the lamp, when lit and kindled in its niche, illumineth all around it, its surroundings and directions, likewise know thou this primordial letter “H” when it is kindled in the niche of the letter “W” - that is, the eternal Temple - the heavens are illumined thereby and all names and attributes are enlightened thereby, and whatsoever is designated as a “thing” from the highest ranks of creation to the lowest stations of existence. And all derive their light from this luminous lamp in this unity-bearing niche according to their ranks, stations and manifestations. And thou, O questioner, if thou wouldst purify the eyes of thy heart and inner being from beholding the lamp and the niche, the high and the low, the far and the near, and from all that hath appeared in the Kingdom of Names and the Realm of Attributes, thou wouldst witness how this eternal lamp shineth of itself by itself and is kindled by the fire of its own essence for its own essence, that thou mayest be of those who have recognized the seats of the Cause and the sources of knowledge, and have attained unto what God hath desired for them through them. O spirit! Shouldst thou find the fountain of life which We have veiled in the darkness of words, that thou mightest become as Khidr of the Cause - drink thereof and fear not, that thou mayest enter this eternal city and be overwhelmed by these divine and eternal rivers. Therefore know, O my brother, that I have interpreted all verses and signs, all revealed Books and established Scriptures, and all recorded and descended Psalms, for We have previously demonstrated and proven that all thou beholdest in the heavens and earth is naught but the manifestations of God’s Name, the appearances of His attributes, the expressions of His sovereignty and the emergence of His power. For the Essence in its essence will never be manifested unto anything, nor comprehended by anything, nor known through anything - it hath ever been independent of the comprehension of its creation and exalted above the recognition of its servants. For it is an impregnable, inaccessible Mystery, transcendent, elevated, sublime, sanctified beyond recognition and free from description and exposition. The hands of the sanctified ones fall short of attaining unto the knowledge of His Essence, and the feet of the mystics stumble in their attempt to comprehend His Reality. When the door of knowledge of the Essence was thus closed to the servants, He opened for them the gates of Names.</p>
<p>When cognizance of the Divine Essence was barred to the faces of all created things, and the feet of the mystics faltered in their attempt to comprehend Its reality, He, in completion of His grace and in fulfillment of His favor and mercy, opened unto them the gates of Names and Attributes. He ordained that whoso desireth to know Him should turn his gaze upon the Manifestations of His Attributes in the vestures of His Names, for when the Essence appeareth, It ceaseth to be Essence, and this designation can no longer be applied to It, inasmuch as while concealed in the Treasury of the Unseen, It is referred to as the Essence. Yet even with this description, It is described as that which cannot be known save through Itself, cannot be described except by Itself, and cannot be comprehended save by Itself. And when there appeareth from It a revelation or attribute, it entereth and returneth into the kingdom of Names and Attributes, even as hath been attested by that which hath been sent down from the Throne of Glory: “I was in My Ancient Essence and the Eternity of My Being, I knew My love in thee, wherefore I created thee, cast upon thee My likeness, and manifested unto thee My beauty.” And this likeness and beauty appeared only through the revelation of the Presence of the Essence in the mirrors of Names and Attributes, even as We have detailed its decree aforetime. And verily now, O My brother, I have mentioned and cast upon thee all the stations of Names in the dawning-places of Attributes, and whatsoever pertaineth thereto and terminateth therein, with most perfect and eloquent expression and most sublime and impregnable exposition. When all that We have indicated unto thee of the subtleties of the Divine Realm and the mysteries of the Celestial Domain is established, it shall be proven that I have interpreted for thee all meanings and explanations, and whatsoever can be designated by name or trace, mention or description, manifestation or concealment, and all that floweth upon the tongue and can be expressed in speech. Notwithstanding all this, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand, I possess treasures of meaning in these divine letters, yet I am unable to let fall a single drop from this Ocean of Oneness and this surging Sea of Eternality. It is as though I have not interpreted it by a single letter in the melody which God hath taught me from the songs of the birds of glory in the pavilions of eternity. By God! Were I to mention but a sprinkling of the meanings which God hath deposited therein, the servants would not be able to bear it, nay, they would fall senseless in that very moment. And since the matter is thus, be content with what I have been pleased to bestow upon thee and have cast upon thee of the gems of knowledge and wisdom. Then beseech God, thy Lord, that He may inspire thee with all meanings and explanations in a single letter of His Names, for verily He is the All-Powerful over all things and the Most Exalted above all things. He expendeth as He pleaseth and giveth as He willeth.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee, therefore, to send upon Thy servant the winds of Thy love, that I may arise with mine eyes to serve Thee. Whether Thou givest - and Thou art indeed the Giver unto them that ask - or whether Thou deniest me - and Thou art verily the Withholder from them that seek - Thou art at such times the Possessor of both these Names in both these acts, and it mattereth not whether Thou art called by Thy Name the Giver or by Thy Name the Withholder. Then, alas for me and for Thy servants! Yet Thy servant asketh and hopeth that Thou wilt manifest unto the kingdom another command, for Thou doest whatsoever Thou willest.</p>
<p>I know not, O my God, how long Thou hast cast me into the mouth of the serpent and left me in the valley of abasement and deprivation. By Thy glory! I have reached in abasement the uttermost degree. Turn then, O my God, Thine eyes upon this dust, and Thy vision toward these ashes. Then open before the face of this abased one the gates of Thy glory, and before the temple of this poor one the doors of Thy wealth, and upon this indigent one the gardens of Thy grace and the lights of Thy grandeur. Then shelter this outcast in the precincts of Thy mercy, and this rejected one in the shadow of Thy generosity. Then rain down upon him from the clouds of Thy bountiful grace and the heavens of Thy glorious wealth.</p>
<p>Dost Thou not witness, O my God, how the lamp in the niche of his heart and the light of his breast have been extinguished, and how the dove of his breast has ceased its flutterings of love, its movements of delight, and its notes of longing? Then judge Thou fairly, O my Beloved! Hast Thou seen one oppressed like unto me, or one deprived like unto my likeness, or one forbidden like unto my equal? Nay, by Thy glory! Such could not be counted, nor will ever be counted, wert Thou to search the kingdoms of the heavens and earth with the hosts of Thy hidden realm and the embodiments of Thy most exalted Names. Glorified, glorified art Thou! I am, before Thee, among those who repent and seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>And verily I, by God’s grace and bounty, desire to mount the crimson steed and journey through the heaven of splendor until I reach the highest horizon of the celestial realm and the Ultimate Lote-Tree and the Furthermost Tree, that I may interpret this Divine Word in the Supreme Concourse, whereby the Maidens of Eternity in their snow-white chambers shall weep, and the Birds of Holiness upon the branches of the Tree of Faithfulness shall lament, that perchance this impenetrable mountain may be shattered in pallid souls and manifest therein the greatest signs of its Lord. Know thou that this inner Word, this Light of the Divine Essence, and this Mystery of Oneness hath stations and ranks that none can reckon save God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things. Verily it is a Word wherein lie concealed oceans of meaning and treasured gems of knowledge. In its outward form it telleth of all things while being sanctified above all things, and through it the manifest is made apparent in the kingdom of creation and the hidden is concealed in the realm of invention. It is as though the ancient seas surge within this most mighty Word and most noble and upright Symbol, and there is naught but that deriveth its outer meaning from its outer form and its inner meaning from its inner essence. By it all in the heavens and earth are sustained, such that the sign of its revelation appeareth in all things, and there is naught but that beareth witness to it in its station. And I, at this moment, by God’s grace, bounty, mercy and loving-kindness, shall mention some of its stations in the visible, limited worlds that thou mayest thereby know its hidden, concealed, and veiled stations as befitteth thy station and beseemeth thy rank. Otherwise, God hath not enabled anyone to truly know its worth, for the earth in its entirety is in its grasp, the heavens are folded up in its right hand, the signs are seized by its power, the lights shine forth through its might, the spirits are dispatched by its providence, and the countenances are veiled by its sovereignty. Glorified be God above what I have said or shall say, have known or shall know, have mentioned or shall mention, have described or shall describe, for all this is but now created from this ink flowing upon this luminous tablet. How can it be a proof for the Essence of Divinity and a path to the Beauty of Unity in the Temple of Transcendence upon the Garment of Muhammad? Know thou that the outward station of this Word among the stars and heavenly bodies is that of the sun; among letters and words it representeth the right pillar; among the ranks of divine action it representeth the Will; among the elements it representeth heat; among the seasons, summer; among measurements, length; in man’s outer form it representeth sight, for the station of sight is that of fire; in man’s inner being it representeth the heart; among the faculties it representeth the inner heart; among colors it representeth yellow; and among the elements it representeth fire. Though in each of these stations it representeth all stations and ranks - for instance, when it representeth fire it also representeth water, and through it fire appeared in the worlds of creation and the servants are warmed by the heat of God’s love. Thus when Moses, the Beloved, witnessed this Fire kindled from this divine Tree, he found in his heart such passionate love for God that the lights encompassed him on all sides. Then he cast off from his feet the sandals of limitation and drew forth his hands from the breast of unity, hearing the divine call from the Source of Lordship in the blessed spot on the right of the Mount of the Divine Essence: “O Moses! Verily I am God, the Lord of the worlds.” Thereupon he drank the cups of beginning from the hands of grace […]</p>
<p>And when His hands emerged from the Pocket of Oneness, He heard the Divine Call from the Source of Lordship in the blessed spot on the right side of the Mount of the Divine Essence: “O Moses! Verily, I am God, the Lord of the worlds!” Thereupon he drank from the cups of beginning from the hands of grace, and entered the City of Eternal Life, and became alive with an enduring, everlasting life. Thus is the decree of water applicable to this fire, and if thou sayest this is water, it is truth wherein there is no doubt, and if thou sayest this is fire, it is truth wherein there is no uncertainty. For life is of the nature of water - whosoever drinks thereof shall live forever, and whosoever is deprived shall die, and by this water all things live. Do ye not see? And when there appeared from this fire in this Tree the decree of water, the name of water became true of it. And what water is greater than this sweet water, what wine more delicate than this rapturous wine, and what stream more pleasant than this ancient, primal, flowing stream - the First Spirit, the all-encompassing Light, the mystical Breeze, and the eternal Tree? For this water hath flowed by God’s leave from the Spring of Oneness, having gushed forth from the Mountain of the Divine Essence, appearing in the form of fire in this eternal Tree, that ye might know the decree of water in the realm of fire and the decree of fire in the realm of water, even as was testified to by that which was sent down from the Throne of the Divine Essence. For on this day, at noontide, around the water upon the water around the fire it was visible. Likewise, if thou appliest to it the decree of earth, it is truth wherein there is no doubt, for by it souls find rest from their perturbation, and hearts become steadfast after their trembling and quaking, and by it the illumined, fiery hearts find repose upon this blessed, purified earth, and feet become firm in establishing God’s exalted, sanctified Cause. And stillness is of the nature of earth, for God made it a place of rest and dwelling for the settlement of all that is therein and thereon and thereby and therefor. And likewise the decree of air flows upon it, for just as from air blow the outer, directional winds, so from it blow the musk-laden, spiritual breezes, the holy, eternal fragrances, and the pure, luminous waftings. Dost thou not witness how this eternal wind moved this tranquil soul, separated it from the land of limitations, and connected it to the realm of the Divine Essence and the center of Lordship? Thus were the elements of existence completed through these holy, eternal words. When Moses of eternity drank the brilliant white water from this crimson fire, and his heart found repose upon the spiritual earth in the realm of glory - the yellow sea - the breezes of faithfulness wafted upon him from the throne of meeting. Then was his creation perfected, his countenance illumined, his agitation calmed, his heart assured; he knew himself, found intimacy with the lights of the Divine Realm, witnessed the dawn of the Divine Essence in the lamp of the Realm of Might, was illumined by the sun of the Kingdom in the earthly realm, and there appeared from his countenance the beauty of grandeur in the pavilion of eternity through his annihilation in Him and his subsistence through Him. And if thou desirest to follow this light in the holy atmosphere in the heaven of this Manifestation, then trust in God and say “In the Name of God and by God,” then bring forth thy hands from thy pocket and take from this kindled, blazing fire […]</p>
<p>Take from this blazing, burning fire and fear not, for though outwardly it appears as fire, inwardly it is light and mercy. God guides whom He pleases among His creation with this light, and whomsoever God guides is truly guided, and for whomsoever He leads astray, you shall never find a protecting guide. Thus has the face of grace appeared and the sun of guidance shone forth, and the creation of oneness was completed, and the veil was lifted from the celestial maiden of beauty, who appeared from lofty mansions in the pavilions of divine good-pleasure. The mirror of oneness reflected the lamp of transcendence, and the light of eternality shone from the niche of divine cloud, and the creation of all things was perfected when the Spirit established itself in the heaven of light. By God, O my brother, whenever you mention any of these words, expressions, allusions and signs - speaking of elements, pillars, stars and the like - they are uttered and mentioned in the stations of remembrance, explanation, description and elucidation, for this pertains to human nature and the stations of verbal mention. Otherwise, by Him Who holds my soul in His hand, from these divine letters were created the elements of divinity, the signs of lordship, the pillars of eternity, the divine seasons, the suns of beauty, and the stars of the divine cloud. Indeed, there originated from them that which cannot be mentioned by the tongue nor perceived by sight, save on the day when human perception is renewed by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. At that time, there shall descend upon you what was not mentioned in those days, and other doors shall be opened unto you, for He does whatsoever He wills in whatsoever way He pleases. You shall find fresh, new fruits from a new and wondrous tree, and shall enter the paradise of your Lord, the Most Merciful, delighting therein in the perpetuity of His eternity, the permanence of His everlastingness, and the antiquity of His sovereignty. Thus know the mysteries of the divine identity in this luminous, sanctified pavilion. By God, O my brother, I have completed the word for you and perfected the blessing upon you. No letter remains but I have cast it to you, no word but I have guided you to it, no light but I have caused it to shine for you, no sun but I have made it rise for you, and no spirit but I have sent it to you. If you would be among the wayfarers of the divine cloud, then cast the bucket of meanings into this well of eternality. And if you find the youth of sorrow in the form of a thread in the shirt of blood, do not sell him for a few counted dirhams from limited souls, but make him merchandise for the kingdom, lest you be recorded as unjust in the Egypt of immortality before the mighty encounter. Therefore be fair, O servant - has anything remained, whether in the heavens or on earth, in the unseen or the visible, that I have not explained to you and made clear through the melodies of the holy birds and the songs of those who circle the throne? Perchance the sun of fairness might shine upon you in this arena, that you might be fair in the Cause of God and the cause of His loved ones and chosen ones. Therefore judge fairly by God, O servant - can such delicate, subtle water flow from turbid springs? Can this ancient, divine fire be kindled from the tree of rejection? Can this goodly, enduring fruit come from barren soil? Can this divine, mystical warbling come from dull tongues? Can these wondrous, rapturous remembrances emerge from dead hearts? Say: Do you not witness how the clouds of grace have been raised […]</p>
<p>Be fair, O servant, in the name of God! Can these delicate, translucent waters flow from muddied springs? Can this ancient, divine fire be ignited from the tree of denial? Can this goodly, enduring fruit spring forth from barren soil? Can these divine, nightingale-like melodies issue from stammering tongues? Can these wondrous, soul-ravishing remembrances emerge from lifeless hearts? Say: Do you not witness how the clouds of grace have been raised up, and the rains of bounty and loving-kindness pour down from every direction? If you find within yourselves a thirst of love for this shining, divine, and eternal Countenance, then drink of these flowing, cascading waters, that your souls may find peace, your hearts be cooled, and refreshment may reach your hearts and bodies, your outer and inner beings, your beginning and your end. Thus may you repose upon the thrones of your hearts, drink from the springs concealed in your slumber, and behold the Beauty of the Divine Essence in the mirror of your souls, in the dawning-place of your beings, and in the dayspring of your beauty.</p>
<p>At that moment, when the mysteries of the Divine Identity were completed in the garment of the letter Vav, and the creation of the new was perfected in the temple of eternity, I desired to make mention of the fire which telleth of this Fire in the element of earth, that thou mayest witness the [atoms] of wisdom and the wonders of power in the handiwork of thy Lord and the creation of thy Maker. Know thou that if thou takest from this fiery element which groweth from the tree of this Mount, and cleanseth it with the utmost cleansing, and washeth it with the water which appeareth from the fire sprinkled upon the face of the cloud and descendeth from the cloud that is gathered in the air, and returneth it to the pure white earth from which it appeared, and blendeth them until they become one thing and one essence, the mysteries of the Cause will be made manifest unto thee in this most great kingdom, and thou wilt become independent of all who are in the heavens and self-sufficient beyond all who are on earth, and through the most manifest power of God thou wilt attain unto the greatest treasure of God. And if thou desirest to reach it by another path, take from this brilliant white water and manage it until thou makest its outer part inner and its inner part outer, that its inner oiliness which lieth in the depths of this water may become manifest until it becometh a luminous, subtle oil which the fires cannot burn nor the fire of fancy harm. How wonderful is this noble handiwork and this mighty tiding! There existeth not in all creation a greater sign than this nor a more exalted matter, and none shall succeed in this save whom God willeth from among His chosen ones and His elect from among His creation and from His noble and righteous ones. And in the element of earth nothing telleth of this Divine Fire and this Light of the Identity save this noble handiwork and this veiled symbol and this masked secret and this hidden mystery, for in one thing all natures appear and from it are separated the four elements according to their colors and natures of heat and cold and moisture and dryness. And if thou wouldst purify them and blend them, this element would be perfected for thee in this station. And though it be water in its subtlety and outward form, yet it is fire in its essence and nature, and earth in its dryness, and air in the multiplicity of its colors and manifestations in the stages of treatment. And there cometh forth from it that which burneth away all that is in its nature and essence of excess cold and inharmonious corrupting moistures. And if thou knowest this red light and this brilliant white earth and returnest this spiritual watery fire to the body of this brilliant earth, thy purpose will be accomplished in three days, and if God should will, it would be accomplished more quickly than that, in less than an hour. But strive thou to transform this luminous thirsty earth and water it with this golden, oily, illuminating water, that thou mayest witness the mysteries of Lordship in the earthly element and know the essences of power in the inner secrets of creation. Then know thou that the station of this earth is the station of the bone which hath spirit and soul and body, as thou witnesseth in man. And if thou takest the soul and the spirit and purifieth them until they become like the red ruby, and breathest this holy spirit into the body of this dead bone, this decayed bone will be quickened by the leave of God, the Lord of the Ancient Light and the Sovereign of this mighty element, for this matter is of the two most great lights.</p>
<p>This Holy Spirit breathes into the body of these dead bones that these decayed bones may live by the leave of God, the Lord of the Ancient Light and the Master of this Mighty Pillar. For this Cause is from the two Greatest Luminaries, and when thou knowest them both and takest from them according to thy need, and temperest their natures after separating them, and purifiest them, and unitest them, and blendest them until they become one thing, all operations in every mineral realm shall be perfected for thee. And there hath been no operation in this endeavor for anyone save through these two Mightiest Pillars: the White Light and the Red Fire. Their management is easy for whomsoever God hath assisted and guided in His Cause, and made him among the treasurers of His knowledge, the bearer of His revelation, the companion of His Cause, the mine of His wisdom, the trustee of His secret, the repository of His grace, and the fountainhead of His bounty. And if thou shouldst follow this principle which We have mentioned to thee in all the ranks of knowledge concerning minerals and plants, after turning unto God and achieving extinction in Him and subsistence through Him, thou shalt attain unto that which God hath intended for thee through the hidden treasures of His knowledge and the stored mysteries of His wisdom. For this principle is among the principles that have encompassed all possibility in their essence and all creation in their form, for the Cause is naught but separation and union. And if thou art able to separate all that is in the heavens and earth, and unite them all after purification until they become one thing, the mysteries of this mighty secret shall be made manifest unto thee. I seal these words with the remembrance of God, the Most High, and I say: This is the Truth from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>=== START BH00074 ===</p>
<p>My spiritual beloved, who has been named Ali-Qabl-Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God and His light, may consider:</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath revealed Himself through the influence of His Most Exalted Pen to all who dwell in the kingdom of creation. Then did every tongue speak, every ailment heal, every ignorant learn, every poor one become enriched, every seated one arise, every stationary one hasten forward. Through Him all faces turned and all souls drew near, and the dove of utterance warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Proof. Verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. The glory shining from the horizon of the will of the All-Merciful be upon the daysprings of divine knowledge and the dawning-places of certitude - they who have arisen on their feet, who have spoken with their tongues, who have gestured with their sleeves, and who have indicated with their eyes and eyebrows toward God, their Creator, their Fashioner, their Provider, their Quickener, and their Slayer. These are servants to whose acceptance, sincerity, humility, submissiveness and steadfastness in this Cause the Most Exalted Pen hath testified - the Cause whereby the mountains have crumbled and the faces of the people of error, who have turned away from the final outcome and accepted every heedless impostor, have been darkened.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God, Lord of Names and Ruler of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Pen moved upon the Tablet and revealed Thy servants and creatures, to assist Thy chosen ones to serve Thy Cause in such wise that neither the opposition of the divines nor the oppression of the princes shall deter them. Then, O my God, brighten their eyes with the lights of Thy countenance and illumine their hearts with the splendor of Thy knowledge. Moreover, manifest through them in the realm of creation that which shall endure throughout the dominion of Thy kingdom and Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And now, O essence of my heart and delight of my soul, the fragrance of sincerity unto God, the True One, was diffused when I opened thy letter. By the life of the Beloved! I found therein what trees find in the rain. When I read and understood it, I desired the hidden mystery and the treasured secret. When I presented myself and attained the honor of His presence, the sun of permission shone forth and I submitted its contents before His countenance. Then the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which was as spirit to bodies, light to eyes, the water of life to the thirsty, and the choice wine of divine knowledge to the peoples of the contingent world. He, exalted be His glory and mighty His dominion, said: “O thou who drinkest from the cup of My love! Hearken unto My call from around My shrine. Verily, there is no God but I, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through Our grace. This is thy first letter which the servant present before the Throne hath brought and read by Our command. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Wise. Well is it with thee, O thou who hast turned to the Countenance and attained unto this Station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of Names, and hast heard the call of the Wronged One when He was speaking in His Name, the Dominant over what was and what shall be. Thou hast attained unto that whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Be thou ablaze with the fire of the Cause and radiant with this Light whereby all who dwell in the kingdoms of the unseen and the seen have been illumined. Blessed art thou for having desired to serve thy Lord and for having spoken among the servants that which thou didst hear and witness in this praiseworthy Station. Remind the people of the Most Great Steadfastness and give them the glad tidings of My loving-kindness, My bounty and My mercy which have preceded existence. We counsel them to be steadfast in such wise that neither the book of the sinful nor the leaves of the infernal tree shall deter them. Say: Should anyone bring you the book of the wicked, leave it behind you, then read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in a preserved tablet.”</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to all the friends from this Wronged One and say: In numerous Tablets mention hath been made of the Cause and its greatness, and of steadfastness and its station, that all may, through divine bounty, attain unto such a state wherein neither the world, nor its conditions, nor its manifestations, nor its might may debar them from the horizon of the All-Merciful. Mention of the cawer and the birds of night was revealed in Tablets during Our sojourn in Iraq and in the Land of Mystery and in the Most Great Prison, and sent to all regions that all might become aware and act in accordance with that which God hath willed. It was observed that certain souls were deprived of the warbling of the Nightingale of the Divine Manifestation by the mewing of a cat, despite their claim to high ranks of steadfastness. God willing, the fragrances of the All-Merciful must needs be so diffused in that land that none shall find occasion to hesitate. Be thou steadfast in the service of thy Lord, and vocal in His remembrance and praise amongst the servants. Thus doth the Mother Book command thee.</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart! Strange it is that certain souls cannot distinguish between a foul odor and the fragrance of musk. Consider the people of the Bayan who are now turned away - they walk exactly in the path of the people of the Furqan, yet call themselves people of the Bayan, and with the utmost deceit and guile are occupied in leading holy souls astray. Among them is Mirza Ahmad of Kirman who at first showed the utmost devotion and sincerity, but later, due to his madness and reprehensible deeds, was cast aside. He went to certain cities in the land of Kha, speaking that which his self and passion commanded. When his inner secrets were exposed and he was frustrated, he returned and sent several petitions to the Most Holy Court with complete supplication, penitence and remorse. He then went to the land of Ha and took refuge with one of the holy souls, who sent a petition to the Most Holy Court interceding for him. Later he went to the great city and broke the Covenant, sending forth certain vain satanic utterances to various regions. By the life of God, one is astonished at such souls! Now several petitions from this unjust one exist wherein he hath shown such helplessness that whoever would see them would be convinced of his sincerity, acceptance and faith. Yet wherever he went, his deeds and words became the interpreter of his inner reality, and now they have expelled him from the great city. God protect us and the company of the monotheists from his deceit and the deceit of his like. Before the faithful he appears in complete agreement and claims faith and certitude, while before the unfaithful he appears in complete accord. In these days he obtained a book from the Prison and sent it to Abadih in Shiraz, and from there they sent a copy of this Prison book to one of the friends in this land. The details were submitted to the Most Holy Court. This utterance was revealed from the tongue of the All-Merciful - exalted be His glory: Those who are nourished by the fruits of the Supreme Pen are not barred from the Lord of Eternity by the books of the world, much less by such delirious utterances.</p>
<p>Likewise, in a Tablet to one of the sons of Khalil who is in those regions, these blessed and decisive words were revealed - holy be His glory: “In the first year, these blessed words were heard from the Most Exalted Pen: ‘Blessed are they who have recognized this wondrous Cause and turned unto this wondrous Path. This lofty and most exalted station cannot be attained except through the effacement of all that was before and through attentive ears. Well is it with him who hath attained unto this most glorious and most resplendent station.’”</p>
<p>I beseech God to aid all to hearken unto the divine Word. By Him Who is peerless in utterance and unique in speech! If the peoples of the world were to hearken to these two passages that have been mentioned, they would assuredly discover the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and would be so enkindled by the heat of the love of the Lord of all beings that they would regard all else besides God as non-existent and evanescent. How sweet is that fragrance when it is diffused amongst the peoples! The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid all to recognize this Cause through which the foundations of existence were shaken, save those whom God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, hath willed.</p>
<p>Reflect upon this verse revealed in the Most Holy Book, which was sent down upon the initial arrival at the Most Great Prison. His glory be exalted! He saith: “O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, behold thee in a state which God does not approve. We see therein that which none knoweth except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We perceive that which secretly passeth from thee. With Us is the knowledge of all things recorded in a perspicuous Book.”</p>
<p>God, our Lord, the Lord of our fathers, and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth, hath spoken truly. We have believed in Him and in His knowledge which hath preceded all created things, and in His mercy which hath encompassed the worlds. You yourself know that when the Most Holy Book was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will, even Ahmad was not outwardly present. From the allusions in the revealed verses, he must have had a companion in that land. However, afterwards the Ancient Tongue gave glad-tidings to that land, saying: “Grieve not at this. God will raise up therein men of mighty strength who will remember Me with such remembrance that neither the misgivings of the learned nor the doubts of the suspicious will keep them back. These shall behold their Lord with their own eyes and shall cause Him to triumph by their own selves. These, verily, are of those who are steadfast.”</p>
<p>Blessed is the eye that hath seen and the ear that hath heard that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered in the nights and days. Several years ago, one day Jinab-i-Amin - upon him be the Glory of God - was present in the Most Holy Court. The Countenance of the Ancient One turned to him and said: “Verily, We perceived a foul odor from the Land of Kaf and Ra.” And this evanescent servant wrote this matter several years ago in reply to one of the friends. Glory be to God! How far these suspicious souls appear to be from the straight path, despite the revealed verses, the manifest proofs, the shining evidences, and the visible signs! They wander and walk in the wilderness of idle fancies. They have not understood the meaning of the Day of God - for had they understood it, they would not have remained veiled for less than that, but would have turned with their whole being toward the Most Great Ocean and hastened thereto. It seems they are heedless of the Greatest Trump and unaware of the Most Great Call.</p>
<p>One of the Letters of the Living inquired of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be His sacrifice - concerning “Him Whom God shall make manifest” Who is mentioned in the Bayan. Such an answer was revealed from the Source of the Command that every fair-minded soul would perceive that this station hath no need of mention, description, definition or praise. Rather, it is sanctified above all that hath been or shall be said, for no one’s knowledge hath ever encompassed Him or ever shall, and no soul’s understanding hath ever fathomed Him or ever will. This servant is astonished at what the heedless souls have understood and to what they cling. In any case, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else but Him be His sacrifice - spoke these exalted words in response to the questioner. His mighty Word states:</p>
<p>“I have indeed received thy letter, and that which is contained therein is a gem. Were it not for what is in it, I would not have answered thee on this paper, nor at this moment with the most exalted words that could be ordained in creation. How great is the mention of Him about Whom thou hast inquired! That indeed is more exalted, more mighty, more glorious, more inaccessible, and more holy than can be comprehended by hearts through their knowledge, or spirits through their prostration before Him, or souls through their praise of Him, or bodies through their mention of His glory. How momentous is thy question, and how insignificant thy being! Can the sun which is but a mirror of His manifestation in the Point of the Bayan ask about the Sun before Whose countenance those very suns, if they be true suns, prostrate themselves on the day of His manifestation? Otherwise they are unworthy of His sacred loftiness and the exaltation of His remembrance. Were it not that thou art from the First Vahid, I would have imposed limits upon thee for having asked about the God Who created thee, sustained thee, caused thee to die, and raised thee up in this form through the Point of the Bayan in that Manifestation unique in being. Say first, when thou wishest to bring His remembrance to thy mind: ‘Glory be to God, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm’ nineteen times…”</p>
<p>If the people of the Bayan or the people of the world were illumined with the light of fairness and would observe and ponder these crystalline words which have shone forth from the dawning-place of the heaven of divine knowledge, they would all surely turn with their whole being to the Ocean of Life. They have taken the essence of the entire Bayan and mentioned it in the most wondrous utterance. In truth, this blessed word is an incomparable gem and is reckoned as a peerless utterance in the Book. It is the unique pearl of the ocean of knowledge and the singular word of the Kingdom of utterance. His mighty Word states:</p>
<p>“And I have written a gem concerning His mention, which is that He cannot be known through My allusion nor through what is mentioned in the Bayan. Yea, by His glory, that word is greater in the sight of God than the worship of all who are on earth, for the essence of all worship leads to that. Therefore, as thou hast known God, know Him Whom God shall make manifest, for He is more glorious and more exalted than to be known through any other than Himself or to be indicated by the allusion of His creatures. Verily, I am the first servant who hath believed in Him and in His verses, and I have taken from the virgin gardens of the paradise of His knowledge the gardens of His words. Yea, by His glory, He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, and all are upheld by His command.”</p>
<p>With these clear utterances, conclusive words, exalted verses, and irrefutable proofs, the people of the Bayan have avoided mention of Divinity and have arisen in opposition and objection to such a degree that cannot be described. Consider the loftiness of this Cause, its exaltation, its glory and its station, and then observe the baseness of these ignorant people. Like unto the followers of the Furqan, they desired to introduce for a thousand or two thousand years the game of successorship, and likewise to appoint Imams, Chiefs and Nobles. The Supreme Pen in this Most Great Revelation proclaims: “This is the Day of God, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of Revelation, did ye but witness it. None is mentioned therein save God alone, did ye but perceive it. He hath come with the truth, sanctified above every witness and witnessed thing, and exalted beyond all that hath flowed from the Pen and been uttered by the tongue, did ye but know it.”</p>
<p>Each faction among the factions has clung to a word, turning away from its Owner, its Revealer, and its Creator. Some have said that the station of Divinity is too great - one cannot accept this station from anyone. These have denied what the Point of the Bayan uttered and that wherewith the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, have given glad tidings. The Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - declares: “Verily, He speaks in all things, saying: ‘I am God,’” and likewise says: “Should He be established upon the dust, every atom of dust would proclaim: ‘This is the Throne whereon the All-Merciful hath been established.’”</p>
<p>The Point of Revelation is today mentioned in the tongue of the people of Baha with these words: “Verily, He hath ever been sanctified above the mention of Names, and above them, below them, and beside them. He cannot be known through aught else nor described by aught other than Him. All things have testified that He is, verily, the Sanctified, the Exalted above all allusions, utterances, evidences, unities and eternities.” Some have objected that He must appear at the time of Mustaghath, while the time for His appearance had not yet come. These shameless people would set a time for the Ancient King, of Whom the Point of the Bayan says: “He is sanctified above My mention and allusion.” This mention of Mustaghath which He made was to prevent the outsider, and He made this word alone a cause for the testing of the people. How can He Who, by the testimony of the Point of the Bayan Himself, cannot be known through the entire Bayan, be known through the word Mustaghath, which is but a part of the Bayan, while “verily, He cannot be known through the Bayan”? Moreover, He says that if He should appear at this time, it is incumbent upon all to acknowledge that Blessed Tree. In the Book of Hayakil the mystery of Mustaghath is evident - blessed are they that know. And He gave glad tidings to this same questioner, who was one of the Letters of the Living and who is still living, that he would attain His presence. His mighty Word declares: “Perchance in eight years, on the day of His manifestation, thou shalt attain the presence of God. If thou dost not attain it at the beginning, thou shalt attain it at the end. But be thou assured that the Cause is greater than every great thing, and the Remembrance is mightier than every mighty thing.”</p>
<p>They who hold fast to the Most Great Name should meditate upon these sublime words, lest they be debarred by mere words from the ocean of inner meanings and be prevented by mention of ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’ from His sovereignty. O by my Lord! Verily this Cause is greater than every great thing, and this Remembrance is mightier than every mighty thing. Blessed are they who understand, and joy be to those who are insightful and contemplative. This evanescent servant has repeatedly mentioned these remembrances in letters to the friends. However, as in these days the braying of the ravens that was promised has been raised and the book of perdition has appeared, it is mentioned again so that that Beloved One may make the friends aware, that the people of Baha may witness what befitteth them and may manifest the most great steadfastness. God willing, all should observe the verses of Truth, nay rather memorize them, that they may at all times be blessed with the sweetness of the water of divine knowledge.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote that after attaining the divine presence, you witnessed another station granted by the establishment of the Chosen Beauty, such that all those aspects and conditions of previous steadfastness were, compared to what followed, but wavering itself and the very essence of agitation. And likewise you beseeched the Exalted Truth, magnified be His grandeur and glorified His majesty, to cause you to attain a station wherein you would, in His path of love, detach yourself from soul and spirit, from name and fame, from being and nothingness, from honor and dishonor. All these matters were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Threshold, exalted be His greatness. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance. God willing, may it be witnessed with perfect sanctity and detachment and whatsoever beseemeth the Day of God, and may the station of the most great martyrdom be attained. Today, service to the Cause is among the greatest of deeds. Assured souls must engage in teaching the Cause of God with perfect wisdom, that the fragrance of the garment of the All-Merciful may be diffused in all directions. This martyrdom is not limited to the shedding of blood, for it is possible for one to be recorded in the Book of the Lord of Names as a martyr while still possessing the bounty of life. Blessed art thou for having desired to sacrifice all that thou hast and art and all that is with thee in My path.</p>
<p>At this station, this evanescent servant sets forth before you the utterance of the All-Merciful that was revealed concerning the station of martyrdom of the King of Martyrs, that all the friends may gather the sublime and exalted pearls from the ocean of divine utterance. Thus speaks He, exalted be His glory, addressing ’Ali-before-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny:</p>
<p>“All the chosen ones of God must, God willing, arise to that which will promote the Cause of God, and act accordingly. Let them ponder which deeds today will cause the elevation of the servants and the advancement of the Cause. Conflict, contention and corruption have been forbidden in most of the Tablets, and this blessed word hath descended from the heaven of the divine will: ‘The Cause of God must be promoted through wisdom and utterance, not through the sword of steel or aught else.’ Many such utterances are found in the divine verses. The possessors of insight have, God willing, seen and understood. In this case, the people of truth must ponder what will remove the veils of the people and cause the exaltation and elevation of God’s Cause.</p>
<p>O ‘Ali! Reflect upon that which hath flowed from the Pen. In life, sacrifice thyself in the path of Truth. This is a martyrdom that is not limited to pen, tongue, utterance and tablets. The Letter ?a’, upon him be from all glory its most glorious, attained unto this supreme martyrdom, even before his outward martyrdom, for he had no will, desire or thought of his own. All these he sacrificed for the Beloved, and afterwards attained unto outward martyrdom, offering up his life in the path of the True Beloved. He removed the crown of life from his head and cast it at the feet of his Friend. Blessed is he who hath recognized this station, and blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Verily, whosoever hath truly surrendered himself unto God and become effaced from self in His path, such a one will not consider his own station, rank, fame or name, but will fix his gaze upon the Cause of God and that which establisheth His wisdom. I swear by the Sun of My utterance! He who hath attained unto that which My Pen hath spoken hath indeed prospered in all the worlds of My dominion. Beware lest anything debar you from My straight path.</p>
<p>All must strive with the utmost effort to acquire the word of divine good-pleasure. The people are ignorant and heedless. A teacher is needed, and if that teacher acts in accordance with the command of God, surely the light of his utterance will illumine the world and draw the peoples to the direction of the Ancient Beauty.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! Since God - exalted be His glory and magnified be His grandeur - hath sanctified the promotion of His Cause from conflict, contention, the drawing of swords and the like, therefore must we hold fast to the cord of goodly deeds and spiritual qualities. If anyone acts for the sake of God according to what hath been mentioned, this will surely have an effect in the world and will rend asunder the thick veils, for that which God hath ordained as the cause and means for the victory and advancement of His Cause is indeed penetrating and effective. To this testifieth every discerning soul.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant, from the time of the preliminary events in the Land of ?ad, hath been uttering “Would that I had been with them!” Truly they attained unto a station the yearning for which shall forever remain with those who are nigh unto God, the sincere ones, and the likes of this evanescent servant. Now we beseech the Exalted Truth that He may cause both you and this servant to attain unto this martyrdom which hath flowed from the Supreme Pen, that we may, in our lifetime, sacrifice ourselves in service to the Friend and attain unto that which God hath willed.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote about the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar being designated in the land of Ta, and likewise being established and becoming established through God’s grace in other lands - these matters were presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply: “Blessed is the spot, and the house, and the place, and the city, and the heart, and the mountain, and the refuge, and the cave, and the valley, and the land, and the sea, and the island, and the meadow where mention of God hath been made, and His praise glorified.” This binding decree was revealed in the Most Holy Book. However, these matters are contingent upon wisdom. In all cases one must look to the horizon of wisdom, for the corrupt ones and troublemakers lie in wait, seeking to find a pretext to raise an uproar. Among the followers of the Furqan, naught remaineth of the fundamental divine laws and God’s religion save a name. All are wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies and vain imaginings, clinging to the ignorant ones of the earth. Nevertheless, they have striven and continue to strive with the utmost effort to extinguish the divine light that hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of knowledge. Fie upon them and those who follow them! By the lights of the Ancient Countenance that endureth after the passing of all things - the people of the Bayan are seen to be more veiled, more lost, and more debased, for after the rending of veils and the burning away of allusions and glory-clouds, they have clung to the vain imaginings of the past. They have taken for themselves an idol besides God. Lo! They are among the most lost in the perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>The raising of Mashriqu’l-Adhkars in the cities and regions of the land of Kha is beloved, for it accordeth with the Book of God and His ways. But it must be concealed from all save trustworthy, steadfast souls. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve the Cause, and blessed is the servant who hath traveled through the lands to spread the signs of the Lord of Creation. However, in the lands of Ta and Ya and Shin and elsewhere, one must be patient and hold fast to the cord of patience until the Sun of the Cause shineth forth from the horizon of permission, for in these places the manifestation of such matters lieth outside the requirements of wisdom. Would that the heedless people would understand their own manifest interests! We see them in profound ignorance. Should any soul understand what is truly good for him, he would not exchange a single letter of God’s commandments for the whole world. Alas! Alas! Their deeds have deprived them of God’s mercy, His knowledge and His commandments.</p>
<p>As to the matter of the Blessed Spot - it is most beloved, and an explicit command hath previously been revealed by the Supreme Pen. However, its affairs must remain concealed, for some of the friends are weak and with the slightest hesitation or doubt they make mention of it, while the oppressive souls lie in wait. If they do not interfere, they may demand payment of funds. The taking of funds is not and was not acceptable, but such matters may cause grief to holy souls. Therefore, the utmost wisdom must be observed in all affairs. We beseech God to assist that person in serving the Cause. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and in His grasp is the dominion of the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Consider how God hath designated this Blessed Spot for the good of all on earth; nevertheless, should they become aware of it, they would arise in lamentation and wailing and cry “O Religion!”</p>
<p>You mentioned you had sent numerous letters with no response received over a long period, even ages and centuries passed with no word, until recently when Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin (may the glory of God, the True Sovereign, the Manifest, be upon him) sent your letters addressed to this ephemeral one. He wrote that correspondence had been delayed en route, and likewise regarding the box of paper and pens - they wrote these days that the box has now arrived. The point is that apparently no news was received, otherwise the response would not have been neglected. God willing, may you be so enkindled by the fire of divine love that you become the cause of igniting frozen souls. Thus far was the response to one of your esteemed letters, and then another joy-bestowing letter cheered this grieving heart. Complete delight was obtained from its fragrances, for it began with mention of your Beloved and our Beloved and the Beloved of all in the heavens and earth. Subsequently it was presented at the Most Holy Court. His utterance, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“God willing, may they attain to that which they have beseeched from the Exalted Truth. Blessed is he who has turned to the Supreme Horizon, who has drunk of the Kawthar of immortality and the Tasnim of the divine presence from the hand of bounty of the Lord of Names. And God willing, may they speak and make mention of the Truth, sanctified from all things, that perchance dead souls may be quickened by the breaths of remembrance and attain to the station of ‘Verily, unto Him shall we return.’ The Day is manifest, and this is the Day which all have been promised, and the lights of the Sun of Truth are visible, yet the ignorant ones of the earth have turned away from it, for the nature of the bat has overcome those souls. Therefore are they deprived of the rays of the Sun of inner meanings. Convey greetings from the Lord of Names to the friends in the land of Kha. Verily We give them glad tidings of My remembrance and My mention and My loving-kindness, and We remember them as a grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Those souls who have ascended the heights of certitude and have drunk from the Salsabil of life in the days of the All-Merciful are all remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. Say: O trees of the garden of divine love! The rains of mercy are ever flowing and descending. God willing, may the conditions of the world and the oppression of nations not deprive you thereof. By the life of God! The world and all therein are transient. Strive that ye may drink from the Euphrates of the mercy of the All-Merciful. By the Divine Essence! Whosoever drinks thereof is adorned with eternal life and an everlasting ornament, and arises to serve his Lord in such wise that neither the blame of the blamer nor the derision of the infidels who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, can turn him aside. O friends! Gather together with joy and fragrance, and with perfect wisdom and utterance, and drink of the most pure and luminous wine in the name of the Lord of Power. Verily it is My wondrous love, My cherished word, and My holy, transcendent, sublime remembrance. Be not saddened by the calamities of the world. By God! The ocean of joy yearns for your presence, for every good thing hath been created for you and will appear according to the requirements of time. Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen give you glad tidings from this Most Great Prison as a bounty from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>With regard to what was mentioned about your attention being directed to the land of Kha, and your entry into the land of Ba, and your sojourn there for nine full days, and the manifestation of the fire of love among souls turning to God - praise and thanks be to God Who confirmed you in mention, praise and service to His Cause. God willing, the breezes of discord will be cut off from all directions and the sweet fragrances of unity and harmony will waft among the friends. The first and foremost cause for the exaltation of God’s Cause among His servants is unity and accord, as well as virtuous character and conduct. God willing, may all attain unto these.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the Sadat of Shahmirzad, upon them be the Glory of God, and their arising to make mention and offer praise and serve the Cause - this was presented at the Most Holy Court and He said: “God willing, may they ever attain to this most glorious and exalted station. We make mention of them as We mentioned them before, and We counsel them with that whereby God’s Cause will be exalted in cities and lands.”</p>
<p>Likewise, what you mentioned about various countries and lands was a source of joy and gladness. God willing, may they at all times manifest the fire of divine love with an ever-increasing flame, and strive each day to witness themselves occupying a station in the love of God higher than that of the previous day.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the sons of Khalil and the friends in that land, all was presented at the Most Holy and Supreme Court. His utterance, exalted be His grandeur: “O My loved ones in Kha! Hearken unto the call of God, your Lord, the Most Glorious. He makes mention of you with that which will cause your remembrance and your spirits to endure in God’s Kingdom, the Lord of the worlds. Vie ye with one another in service to God and His Cause - this will profit you in this world and the next. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Informed, the All-Knowing. Grieve not over what ye witness today. A day shall come when the tongues of nations will proclaim: ‘The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the All-Informed.’ Thus have We illumined the horizon of the heaven of utterance with this luminous, holy, radiant Light. We counsel you, O My loved ones, with trustworthiness, truthfulness, and to act in accordance with what ye have been commanded in My Gracious Book. Glory be upon you and upon those who love you, from God, the One, the Single, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Regarding what was mentioned about your visit to the land of ?ad and your mention of divine favors for the descendants of the Name of God, ?a, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - it is known and evident that whosoever shows love today to these descendants is beloved of God. Praise be to God that you have been and are successful, and this righteous deed was accepted at the Most Holy and Supreme Court. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! Letters have been received from Aqa Mirza Ism and the son of the martyr, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise they had written a letter to this servant for which a reply was sent. Praise be to God they are adorned with the ornament of divine love, and this garment has been and is befitting for all souls, were the people of the world to be adorned therewith.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about representing this evanescent one, this was my utmost desire - praise be to God for this! In truth, this matter is among the greatest attainments. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to bestow a mighty reward. I bear witness that there is no God but Him, and that whosoever hath visited them is as one who hath visited the Lord of eternity upon the Most Great Throne. This blessed word did this servant hear from the Tongue of Grandeur, and the peerless portrait was accepted in the most excellent state at the Most Holy Court, and they illumined it with the lights of the Throne, saying: “This is among the most glorious gifts that hath been presented before the face of the Lord of Names. Blessed is he and those whose names were mentioned before the Throne. Thus doth God remember His devoted servants.”</p>
<p>Although this evanescent servant has caused you trouble and, as the Persians say, has been long-winded, yet since the primary purpose and true desire was to make mention of the Goal of all the worlds and His loved ones, there was and is no harm in it. The replies to the friends and dignitaries of that land have been and are being submitted, and God willing, will be sent gradually, as sending thick packets would not be wise. Likewise, some exalted, blessed, and holy Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of will in response to the petition of His Honor A.H.M., upon him be the glory of God, and the names mentioned in his petition. If God willeth, these will be sent later.</p>
<p>Another matter: news arrived from Hadba that His Honor, the spiritual friend Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, is returning. Therefore, nothing was submitted to him this time. I beseech the Most High to strengthen him in all conditions and ordain for him the good of both worlds. His petitions were presented at the Most Holy Court and responses were revealed which, God willing, will be sent. I convey my greetings and utter servitude to the honored friend Mulla Ali, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise to His Honor Ibn-i-Shahid, upon them both be the glory of God, and to Aqa Khudadad and Aqa Azizu’llah and other dignitaries, upon them be the glory of God. All that was sent to this servant was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and this servant has also submitted replies to some. I beseech God for the ability to succeed in sending them later.</p>
<p>Concerning what was mentioned that His Honor Mulla Ghulam-Rida from Shah[…] wrote to you that there is a small amount of the Right of God with this atom, and there are several poor and distressed people in this city, and moreover some Tablets and writings need to be copied and sent to the surroundings of this land - is it permissible to spend this amount on these purposes? Similar matters have previously been presented at the Most Holy Court. The firm ruling is that in every city, whatever exists or will exist of the Right of God must be presented at the Most Holy Court, and whatever ruling is issued should be carried out, so that every matter may be orderly. However, in this specific case, permission was granted for whatever His Honor Mulla Ghulam-Rida intended to do, though hereafter it would be preferable that they act according to what was revealed in the Most Holy Book, so that all may be adorned with the ornament of the will of the Beloved of the worlds.</p>
<p>The mention of the honored mother, upon her be the Glory of God, and others was made in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. Thus spoke the Tongue of Power and Might: May all abide and rest beneath the gaze of loving-kindness and the shade of the Tree of Mercy. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon their faces and make mention of them through the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed are they for having attained unto the verses of God, His remembrance and His knowledge in His days. This is none other than a glorious station. The Glory be upon them and upon those women who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of thy brother whose letter was present before the Throne. Give him the glad-tidings of Our remembrance of him that he may be of the thankful ones. We have read his letter and have answered it. We shall soon send him, if God willeth, a gracious Tablet through which he will discover the fragrance of My remembrance and My utterance. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. The Glory of God be upon him from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>It is submitted that the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His blessed footsteps - has for some time gone to a place which is two days’ journey from this land. God willing, after His return, whatever was submitted to Him concerning the degrees of sincerity, nothingness and self-effacement will be conveyed, and the expression of His favor will be sent to your honor. Glory and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>27 Muharram 1298</p>
<p>=== END BH00074 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00075 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>The servant attained unto the presence of his Lord’s mercy, and having washed his face and hands, turned towards the Supreme Horizon. When he arrived, He for Whom all in the kingdoms of command and creation would sacrifice their souls said: “Today is a feast and tomorrow is a fast.” O servant in attendance! Today thou art blessed with divine bounty, tomorrow with abstinence from all else than Him. He commands and decrees, He forbids and bestows in all conditions and deeds. Verily, He is praised in His actions and obeyed in His command. Praise be to God! At that moment the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which intoxicated the servant to such extent that he forgot himself and all else, and the servant was immersed in the ocean of His utterance. His pervading Will summoned him once again, whereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted word: “We have intended to move; it has been long since We visited the garden.” Then, according to the binding command, preparations were made and He proceeded to the garden, accompanied by a group of the faithful. Along the way, mercy rained down from the heaven of grace until the garden became the seat of His throne. When He was established, He commanded the gathering to be present. When they had assembled and partaken of tea before the countenance of our Lord and the Lord of all worlds, He commanded me to bring forth pen, ink and paper. When these were brought, He for Whom all in the kingdoms of command and creation would sacrifice their souls spoke in your remembrance. How sweet is the fragrance of utterance by which God quickeneth all creation! He giveth life to whomsoever He willeth through His grace and mercy, and bestoweth upon whomsoever He desireth through His sovereignty. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Now I convey in Persian that by chance on the previous day your letter arrived, and after it was presented in His presence in the garden, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Desired One of all worlds, and that time was noon on Friday. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Speaker of Truth […]</p>
<p>The Book speaks with truth before the faces of creation. Verily there is none other God except Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He has sent down the verses and manifested the evidences, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have cast the justice of God behind their backs, clinging to every remote oppressor. They have abandoned righteousness and cast aside equity, holding fast to the hem of tyranny without any proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They behold the verses yet deny them, and hear what has been sent down from the heaven of grace and bounty yet turn away therefrom. They are indeed among the transgressors in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. They have denied Him through whose grace God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, has written, and have disputed with Him Who bore afflictions for their salvation, and have committed that whereat all things have lamented. They are indeed among the most lost in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. They have turned away from Him unto Whom the Concourse on High has turned, and for Whose path the Spirit, the Faithful Spirit, has been sacrificed. Thus did the Tongue speak in the Bayan when the Ancient Beauty was walking therein, contemplating the mysteries of His mighty and wondrous Cause. By God! At His utterance arose the lamentation of the Primal Point and the cry of the Prophets and Messengers. Blessed is he who has shattered the idols of vain imaginings and rent asunder the veils of those who disbelieved in the signs of God, the Powerful, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The servant present has brought thy letter and read it before Our face. We have heard thy call and have answered thee with that whereat the ocean of utterance has lamented before the faces of all religions, and the Concourse on High has soared on the wings of grace and bounty until they circled round the Throne in this noble station. Thus has thy Lord taken the Kawthar of His utterance and the rustling of the Lote-Tree of His grace and the murmuring of the waters of His loving-kindness, yet most of the people are among the heedless. They are debarred from that for which they were created, as attested by Him Who speaks at this hour - He is God, the Strong, the Dominant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We have found from thy letter the fragrance of thy turning unto God, thy love, thy sincerity and thy rising to aid His mighty and great Cause. Blessed art thou! We beseech God to assist thee and enable thee to do that which He loves and is pleased with, and to manifest through thee that which shall never end throughout the eternity of His names and attributes. Verily He has power over whatsoever He willeth, yet most people are among the deniers. We love not to compel the servants by force, but rather by their own free will. Blessed are they that understand. Joy be unto thee for having held fast to the cord of remembrance and utterance in support of the Cause of this wronged and lonely One.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. In previous ages the Hand of Power caused the servants to attain, willingly or unwillingly, to that for which they were created. In this Most Great Revelation it is beloved that people should enter of their own accord and drink from the Salsabil of utterance. The Kawthar of utterance is present, the sealed wine is manifest before all faces, but the cup-bearer is rare. Ask thou God to raise up detached teachers for this mighty Cause who will act in a manner befitting this Day. Though praise be to God some are adorned with the ornament of detachment and have done in the path of God that which has amazed the Concourse on High - how many souls who possessed wealth, bounty, glory and station nevertheless drank with utmost eagerness the Salsabil of martyrdom from the hand of bounty. The martyrs who with complete willingness and desire hastened to the place of sacrifice - all have seen and know of them. Yet this has not awakened them. They mention the sacrifice of old and glory in it, and though there is no doubt of his station, yet where are the stations of these souls compared to that? The difference is as between the Pleiades and the earth. Say […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Send forth one who is illuminating, detached, kind, compassionate, content and thankful, that he may guide Thy servants beneath the shelter of Thy most great mercy and acquaint them with Thy straight path and Thy mighty message. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We beseech God to raise up souls who are worthy to impart this Most Exalted, Most Blessed Word, that they may guide the servants into the Goodly City and make them aware of that which God hath willed. He is powerful and mighty. There is no God but Him, the Lord of the throne and the dust, the Lord of the Hereafter and of former times.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and counsel them in that which befitteth the Day of God. By the Sun of Truth, every word that proceedeth from detached hearts is penetrating. Strive that perchance hearts and minds may be sanctified from the tales of the past and adorned with that which befitteth the Divine Day. Today the Word of God is effective, and the joy and gladness of the sincere proceed from it. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant ever beseecheth the Eternal Truth for success on behalf of that beloved one, for His grace hath encompassed all, His confirmation hath assisted, and He hath enabled that beloved one to serve, to aid, to mention and to praise Him. Regarding what was written about Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], that he was sent to the known villages to teach the divine Tablets, and likewise concerning the mention of his steadfastness and the names of those who have ascended unto God - upon him and upon them be the glory of God - these matters were presented before Him Who conversed upon Sinai. This is what God hath revealed in reply:</p>
<p>He saith, blessed and exalted be He: O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! Praise be to God, thou didst turn unto Him and attain unto the word “Here am I,” and thou didst hold fast unto service and became a bearer of Tablets. Well is it with thee, pleasant it is for thee. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty, praise thy Lord for this supreme grace. Remember thy Lord, for He hath remembered thee in the prison. We beseech God to enable thee to preserve that which He hath bestowed. The people of Baha are souls whom names have not withheld from the Creator of heaven. They know none but the Truth and mention none but the Truth. Such souls are worthy of this garden, this city, and this station. By the life of God, the Concourse on High take pride in such souls. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the Garden. He is verily the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the honored beloved ones Mirza Mahmud and Aqa ’Abdu’l-Mu?sin, upon them be the glory of God, after presentation before the countenance of the Lord of Religions, a Tablet from the heaven of bounty was revealed and sent for each, that that beloved one may deliver them. Likewise, especially for Ustad ’Abidin, upon him be the glory of God, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent forth. It is hoped that through the Kawthar of the utterance of the Beloved of the worlds, they may become detached and freed from all else save God. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Powerful, the Supreme, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Jinab-i-Habib-i-Ruhani Aqa Muhammad Rida, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, that they intended to proceed with the honored Jinab, that is Jinab-i-’Ali Beg, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, to the Most Holy Court - after this matter was presented before His countenance, this supreme word descended from the horizon of the Divine Will, He doeth whatsoever He willeth. His words, blessed and exalted is He: “’Ali, upon him be My glory, is granted permission.” Likewise, specifically for Jinab-i-Muhammad Rida who hath attained, at this moment again the light of permission hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Will. However, these matters are contingent upon wisdom and consultation. Should it be agreeable, they may proceed; otherwise, for the first, the reward of attainment, presence, hearkening and beholding shall be inscribed and recorded in the Book of the Lord of all things by the Supreme Pen, and the second hath already attained and received his portion from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, to aid His loved ones in whatsoever today conduceth to the exaltation, elevation, manifestation and spread of the Word of God. Verily our Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about Jinab-i-Karbila’i Baqir, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion - after presentation before the Throne of the Intended One, these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of Will. His words, exalted and sanctified is He:</p>
<p>He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My Will and the light radiating from the direction of My prison be upon thee, O thou who hast attained the choice wine of faith in the days of the All-Merciful and hast turned unto Him when most of the peoples of the world turned away. We, at this moment, make mention of thee with a mention through which God hath sent down upon thee in every time His mercy and His loving-kindness. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. We beseech God, exalted is He, to spread for thee the carpet of forgiveness and to adorn thee with the ornament of pardon and beneficence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We were with thee at the time of thy ascension and We manifested Ourselves unto thee through My Name, the Forgiving, whereby the companions of Paradise and the black-eyed maidens in the highest Paradise were entranced. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Merciful. Praise be to God, at the time of ascension thou didst attain unto the favor of the Truth. We have purified thee and forgiven thee and ordained for thee a station in the highest Paradise. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath attained unto the loving-kindness of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>The divine mercy hath preceded and His grace hath encompassed all. That which is everlasting and enduring hath been revealed from the Kingdom of utterance. Well is it with him. Likewise mention was made of his survivors from the Tongue of Grandeur. That beloved one should give them the glad-tidings and remind them that they may attain unto true joy and spiritual delight through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and His favors.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention that was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Baqir, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], from the people of Ya - after presentation before His countenance, one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for him. I beseech the Truth that they may discover from it the divine fragrances of revelation. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, whoso findeth it will detach himself from all else and from all names. His words, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty:</p>
<p>He is the One Who hath dominion over all who are in earth and heaven […]</p>
<p>O Baqir! Your mention hath come before the Wronged One, and the glance of loving-kindness is directed towards thee. God, exalted be His glory, hath appeared with His everlasting favors and heavenly sustenance, and standeth manifest before the faces of the world. Yet most factions have turned away and risen against His harm. Kings saw not their interests in acknowledging Him, and likewise the ministers and divines, although in the divine Books and Scriptures the Purpose hath been clearly and explicitly made manifest, and the Truth hath declared in most eloquent terms that this supreme Manifestation hath come for the reformation of the world and the advancement of the nations. His wish is that all be illumined with the light of unity and consort with one another in love and harmony, so that the whole earth may be regarded as one country and one land. However, those souls who are deprived of truthfulness and sincerity have imagined the Truth to be like unto themselves, and thus they strive and endeavor to extinguish the divine light. Would that the servants knew! Would that the people understood! For were they to become aware and discover the Purpose, all would turn towards Him and would utter the blessed words “We are God’s!” Beseech God not to deprive the rebellious ones from the ocean of His bounty and bestowal, nor the ignorant from the effulgences of the Sun of knowledge, that all may come and find. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My mention in My prison - a mention that cannot be equaled by the mentions of the world and whatsoever is with the nations. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Aqa Mulla Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto God’s favor and especially revealed for him was that which hath had and hath no likeness. How many are the accepted souls who exist today and have not yet, outwardly, attained unto a single word. Those who have attained should occupy themselves day and night in praise and thanksgiving to the Purpose of the worlds. In these days the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh at all times; from every direction petitions and letters wing their flight, and the waves of the ocean of favor are manifest. Therefore, they desire not to deprive any of the servants, but those souls who say “Is there any more?” and repeatedly seek the everlasting bounty from His abundant grace - this matter dependeth upon the will of God, exalted be His glory. If they attain, they must increase in thanksgiving; otherwise they must utter the blessed words “Praised is He in His doings and obeyed in His command.” In any case, after mentioning their name in the Most Exalted Horizon before the countenance of the Lord of all mankind, one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for them from the heaven of the favor of the Purpose of the worlds. God willing, they shall attain unto it and be illumined by the effulgences of the lights of the Luminary of utterance. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Wise Ordainer, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen is bewildered as to what it should mention, for the signs of the world and the evidences more manifest than the sun are apparent and visible. The Luminary of power is shining and evident before all faces, and the ocean of wisdom and utterance is manifested in such wise that for none of the fair-minded is there any possibility for hesitation. The Blessed Tree is adorned with mature fruits, and the Book is at all times being sent down from the heaven of knowledge. Nevertheless, the people have turned away from the Self-Subsisting Lord and have clung to the dawning-places of idle fancies. The brilliant pearls that have appeared from the Ocean of the All-Merciful’s grace are visible and present before every face. At every moment proofs and evidences appear and shine forth without pause. Glory be to God! They look but deny, they see but comprehend not. I know not by what cord they are clinging, or upon what path they are walking.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! One of My loved ones hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee with a mention from whose horizon light hath shone forth. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest me clinging to that which hath appeared from Thee and been sent down from the heaven of Thy Will. I beseech Thee by the arms of Thy power and the hands of Thy might, to aid Thy servants to be fair in Thy Cause and to acknowledge that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. By Thy glory, O Desire of the world and Beloved of the nations! This servant of Thine hath acknowledged the oneness of Thy Being and the greatness of Thy Cause, and hath confessed to that which hath flowed from the Pen of Thy Will regarding Thy commandments and Thy laws. I beseech Thee to manifest through him that which beseemeth Thy days and shall endure in Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The aforementioned souls have, praise be to God, each been blessed with the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, especially the exalted lady, the Leaf of Paradise, and likewise the speaking spiritual leaf, and the ladies, the Mother of Muhajer and the Mother of Dhabih, upon them be the glory of God and His favors. Praise be to God, all have been and are mentioned in the remembrance of the Desired One of the worlds. Some time ago, his honor the Trustee, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, made mention of that beloved of the heart and mention of the honored ladies in this servant’s letter, and likewise made mention of that which they sent. All was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and was accepted and adorned. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist His loved ones and handmaidens at all times to that which is befitting. In truth, from the earliest days the leaves of that land have clung to the Blessed Tree. Despite the upheaval of the world and the opposition of the nations, they have done that which standeth as a brilliant and steadfast proof of their love, steadfastness, devotion and adherence. Divine confirmation and success have been and are their companions. Verily, our Lord and your Lord, and our Goal and your Goal is the All-Seeing, the All-Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Another missive from that beloved of hearts has, like a spiritual key, unlocked the door of true affection. Praise be upon thy hand and arm! By the life of our Beloved, he has been and is a sincere seeker, an upright speaker, possessed of triumph and victory. If, for example, he were to raise but a kerchief upon a staff, he would be the sovereign of banners and the uprooter of the standards of oppression. The Dehhak of the world has made it ready both for vengeance and for the manifestation of justice from the Lord of grace. A mere span or two of scorched, blackened, meaningless sanctuary became the standard of Kaveh and led the armies of nations. It is hoped that through God’s grace–exalted be His glory–His antecedent mercy, and His perfect bounty, the arising of that beloved one will become the cause of life, thereafter transforming the remoteness of people to nearness, ignorance to knowledge, and tyranny to justice. This is not difficult for God to accomplish. The migrants and helpers whose names and mention had never been heard in any gathering, dwelling in a barren valley inherited by woeful stones, living among harmful beasts, each later became, through the effulgences of the Word, seated upon the throne of understanding in the highest station of contingent being. These stories of old have been heard and witnessed by all. Moreover, the deeds, steadfastness and stations of the chosen ones of this Cause have been and remain sanctified above any parallel or likeness, past or future. These are the souls who were mentioned before mention itself, and were known and existed before existence itself. One drop from the ocean of meaning of the blessed words “The believer is alive in both worlds” suffices–though verily this ocean hath no shore or bound. Blessed is he who ariseth from his station, casteth off his garments, and entereth the sea in the name of his Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. After its recitation, consideration and perusal, it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. This is what the Tongue of our All-Knowing Lord hath spoken in this station. His blessed and exalted Word: He is the One Who watcheth over His loved ones.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of the worlds! The Sun of Truth hath willed to send forth one of its effulgences which hath shone forth from the Luminary of Revelation, the One Who conversed on Sinai, and to manifest, as a token of grace unto the friends of God, exalted be His glory, one Word that hath appeared in the Kingdom of utterance from the Mother Book. Today the waves of the ocean of grace and the lights of the Luminary of justice have encompassed all, yet most are heedless and unaware. They behold the signs yet deny them, and pass them by, turning aside therefrom. The books of the world have been encompassed, and the scriptures are manifest before all faces. By God’s life! For some time now this Wronged One hath, out of pure loving-kindness towards His loved ones, been speaking, else the people of the world were neither worthy to hear nor fit to behold, save those whom the hand of grace and bounty hath seized from God, the Lord of all mankind. Most behold the blessed Tree with its boundless novel fruits, and likewise the ocean and its waves, and the sun and its radiance, yet are deprived and forbidden therefrom. Gladden the loved ones with the mention and utterance of God, and give them the glad-tidings of His grace. Today the true Herald calleth out from every direction and giveth glad-tidings, yet the heedlessness of men hath prevented them and deprived them of the Kawthar and Salsabil which flow at every moment from the divine Pen. Remember My loved ones there with a mention that will attract the hearts and minds, and illuminate them with the lights of utterance, that the earth of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, may be illumined thereby. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest find from them the fragrance of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the Loving. In each letter thereof lieth concealed an ocean of meanings and utterance, yet the people do not understand. They worship the idols of their own selves, yet perceive it not. Say: O people of the earth! Fear God, and follow not the desires of those who have denied the signs of God, the Lord of existence. We have sent down from the Mother Book that which hath caused the highest Paradise to quiver and the Concourse on high to be attracted, yet most of the people know not. At every moment there descendeth that which God hath made the Kawthar of life for all who dwell within the realm of possibility. Blessed is he who hath turned, and taken, and drunk thereof, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. Say: By the life of the Desired One! Your glory, your might, your power, and your riches shall pass away - to this your own realities bear witness, even if your tongues deny it. Fear God and follow not those who have denied God’s grace and mercy, His proof and His Cause. Indeed, they know not. Glory be to God! Such means of grace have appeared from the Causer of causes that the eye of creation hath never seen their like. Sinai crieth out “I have attained unto Him Who conversed with me!” and Heaven proclaimeth “I have attained unto Him Who illumined me!” The fragrance of utterance hath captivated the dwellers of the highest Paradise, and the breezes of revelation have seized the reins of the chosen ones from the hands of the ardent lovers. The dust hath been stirred to speech by the breezes of the morn of revelation, and the mouldering bones have been quickened. Attraction and rapture have encompassed the whole of creation, yet the unjust ones of the world have said and continue to say that which causeth the world of existence to cry out “Would that I had never been!” In any case, thou and the friends should beseech the True One to unlock the sealed gates with the keys of utterance, and not to deprive His servants. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty. Convey to all the kindred My greetings from this Wronged One. His is the praise!</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to all those who are related to thee. To Him be praise, thanksgiving, gratitude and bounty, for He hath bestowed upon thee and thy kindred that of which most of the people of the world remain heedless and veiled. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My proof rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who love thee for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>In every instance there is a wave from the ocean of grace and a radiance from the sun of mercy. Praise be to God, the place is blessed and seeketh, and the Giver bestoweth. God sufficeth us and He is the best Protector, the best Lord and the best Helper.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou hast written about the heedlessness, oppression and transgressions of the people of the Bayan, and likewise about the progress of the children who have ascended from barren lands through the breaths of revelation and have attained to the Kingdom of utterance - verily the divine traces in those who have turned unto Him appear more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye, transforming their very being in an instant and leading them from the corner of ignorance to the realm of knowledge. Glory be to God! His Holiness the Martyr of Zavarih sacrificed his life through but a single word. The details thereof have been revealed in certain Tablets from the Tongue of Grandeur - that which causeth hearts and souls to burn and be attracted.</p>
<p>Concerning the exaltation and progress of the children that was mentioned, in this connection a blessed word was revealed from the Tongue of Him Who is the Purpose of the world and the Herald of nations, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake. His mighty Word declares: “In the Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, His one-year old spiritual children are mightier than all the Bayan, for were they not mightier they could not surpass it and judge what is other than truth.” And He - exalted and glorified be He - saith in another place: “If they were not mightier, they could not enter into the new Revelation and see that Revelation within its shadow.” For they have rent asunder the veils of names and, with the aid of the Beloved of the world, have shattered the idols of vain imaginings. This power cannot be weakened by the might of the world. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the attraction, enthusiasm, longing and yearning of the people of the village - Glory be to God! Until now none has been seen who heard the divine verses and did not submit, except those whose essence was compounded of wickedness, indecency, rancor and hatred. The deniers of the Bayan have recently desired to move and speak contrary to the Will of God. They have chosen for themselves the station of the Shi’ih. Alas for the servants! Their deeds give them the lie but they perceive it not; their words deny them but they know it not. They were previously Shi’ih - what then was the cause of their avoidance of it, and what now is the reason for choosing it again? That which was in the hands of that heedless and oppressive party was, by the testimony of God, false. It was due to His patience and protection that most matters were hidden from view until such time as God shall reveal the measure thereof from His presence. He verily is the Strong, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The people of the village have been and are blessed with the favors and bounties of God, exalted be His glory, from the first dawning of the Day Star of Revelation from the horizon of the world. May God honor their faces by turning away from aught else but Him. On this blessed day each one hath been blessed with special favors. Mention of each was heard from the Tongue of Grandeur - mention that was adorned with the jewels of favors and bounties. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Glory be to His Name, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down through grace from the presence of God, the Most High, to him who is named Abdul-Ghani, that the verses of his Lord may draw him to a station wherein all things proclaim: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment!” We have sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto the heedless! Say: O people of the earth, render thanks unto God, for He hath fulfilled His promise, made manifest His path and revealed His proof, that He may draw you nigh unto Him on this Day whereon the Herald calleth out from a near place: “O people of the earth! The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Promised One hath come with such clear evidence as the eye of creation hath never seen!” To this the Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness from His exalted and glorious station.</p>
<p>Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One. We make mention of thee with that which will draw thee nigh unto the pavilions of thy Lord’s majesty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! That which hath been sent down for thee surpasseth all the ornaments and riches of the world. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen proclaimed with the most high call. Blessed is he who hath heard and said: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know!”</p>
<p>We make mention of thy wife and give her glad tidings of My tender mercy and compassion which have preceded all things, and of My light wherewith the earth and all that is thereon have been illumined. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The Divine Lote-Tree calleth out to its leaf, and the Master to His handmaiden: “Behold the grace and bounty of God! He, from within the Most Great Prison, hath remembered thee with that which hath enraptured the hearts of them that are devoted to the One true God.” Blessed is the ear that hath heard My call, and the foot that hath hastened in the path of My good-pleasure, and the eye that hath beheld My tokens, and the heart that hath turned unto My glorious and wondrous station.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy son and beseech God to strengthen him to remember and praise Him, to draw him nigh unto Him at all times, to shower upon him mercy and grace from His presence. He is verily the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Ghani! When thou hast taken the cup of My loving-kindness from the hand of My bounty and drunk therefrom in My love and My Name, say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I testify that all names have bowed down before Thy Name, and the earth and heaven before Thy Command. I beseech Thee by the light that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will, and by the Word whereby Thou hast illumined the hearts of Thy loved ones, to number me among such as have not been held back by the censure of the censurers from turning to the lights of Thy countenance, nor by the scorn of the aggressors from drawing nigh unto Thy horizon. O Lord! Thou knowest and seest that this servant desireth naught save the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy and the effulgences of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation. The cup of Thy bounty hath taken hold of me, the Kawthar of Thy utterance hath attracted me, and Thy prevailing Will and all-encompassing Purpose move me as Thou pleasest. O Lord! Illumine my outward and inward being with the lights of Thy most exalted Word in Thy days. Then write down for me that which will exalt me through Thy generosity and bounty. Thou art verily powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In regard to Aqa Muhammad Hashim, the head of the post office, upon him be the Glory of God, concerning whom they had written: previously a most holy and exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for him, and now again another Tablet has been revealed. None can reckon the bounties of God’s Most Great Ocean - they are truly beyond the comprehension of the world and its peoples. This servant conveys greetings to him and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to aid him, that he may attain unto the new and everlasting life through the divine Tablet. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Lord of Yathrib and Hijaz.</p>
<p>If one were to reflect with fairness upon the Manifestations of old, and likewise upon this Most Great Manifestation and Momentous News, the tongue of his soul would utter the blessed words “there is none like unto Him.” His word, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, which speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>Today the attraction of the Divine Word hath seized the realities of all things, and each at every moment giveth voice to a word. Blessed are they who have attained unto hearing. This Wronged One hath at all times summoned the servants unto the Lord of Creation, and at every moment hath appeared with clear proofs and evident testimony. Nevertheless, they have clung to vain imaginings and remained deprived of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s mercy. Whence hath such heedlessness arisen, and whereby hath such bounty been withheld? From smooth and solid rocks do rivers flow forth, yet hearts and souls remain frozen and lifeless. We beseech God that He deprive not the people of the world from the ocean of His mercy, nor hold them back from turning toward Him and drawing nigh unto Him. Thy mention hath ever been before the Wronged One. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me and Thy handmaidens through the Pen of Thy Command, for having caused me to hear Thy call and to witness Thy signs. My Lord! Ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds and draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Thou, verily, art the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about the Tablets of Mim of Mihnih and Ha and Kha of Khayrabad: sixteen were sent. O thou beloved of my heart! From the earliest days of this Most Great Revelation, and even before it, verses have encompassed all regions like rain, yet to this day the servants have not become aware. Each day they manifest some new wrong. Strange it is that they remain heedless of that which would cause their exaltation, elevation, glory and advancement. Each soul is occupied with digging a well for himself, yet perceiveth it not. Soon shall they find themselves in the lowest depths.</p>
<p>Concerning the sons of ’Imad, upon them be the Glory of God - after being presented before His presence, two Most Holy, Most Pure Tablets were revealed from the heaven of grace and sent forth. God willing, they will attain unto them and be illumined by the Luminary of utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine Tablet. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. That which they sent has been forwarded by the honored Amin, upon him be the Glory of God, along with other transmitted pages. The deeds of that beloved one and the honored Mulla ’Abbas-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, have been accepted. The servant beseecheth his Lord to make them both springs for His loved ones and rivers for His servants. Verily He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>On this day, which is among the blessed days of the month of Ramadan, seven hours having passed, this servant proceeded to the Ultimate Goal. Mention was made before His presence of the departed and elevated father Mir ’Abbas-’Ali Beg and the honored elevated brother Mir Muhammad-Vali Beg, upon them both be the Glory of God. And specifically for each was revealed that which hath perfumed the world and from which every possessor of smell hath inhaled and continueth to inhale the fragrance of grace. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaketh the truth:</p>
<p>He is the Speaker of Truth</p>
<p>We desired to make mention of him who ascended to the Supreme Companion, as a command from God, the Lord of all beings. O ’Abbas-’Ali! Rejoice in thy station. The Beloved of all who are in the heavens and earth desired to make mention of thee. We purified thee at the time of thy ascension and ordained for thee in the Most Exalted Station that which illumined faces and brought solace to the eyes of those near unto God. We beseech God the Most High at this time to spread for him the carpet of mercy and forgiveness and to adorn him with the ornament of pardon and favor. Verily He is the Lord of the world and the Desire of the nations. There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Vali! The Mother of Utterance maketh mention of thee at this time in the Kingdom of knowledge with a remembrance whereby the ocean of forgiveness and pardon surgeth before all religions, and the fragrance of thy Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Bestower, wafteth. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have attained unto God’s commanding Word in His days and for whom the verses of their Lord, the Most Merciful, were sent down from the heaven of proof. We testify that they are among the triumphant ones in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. By My life! When I made mention of thee, I beheld a host of angels and the Spirit approaching them both with the verses of their Lord and the fragrance of grace, pardon and bounty. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in this mighty, wondrous station. The glory from Us be upon them both and upon those who have ascended to the Supreme Companion with clear certitude. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The fragrance of divine verses and the drops of the rain of the Most Merciful’s mercy have encompassed them and the host of angels and the Spirit. His is the grace, the bounty and the generosity, and by His command are both existence and non-existence. The servant beseecheth his Lord to send down upon them both, at all times, mercy from His presence, for He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>The aforementioned souls, whether from among the kindred or others, have all been and continue to be the recipients of special favors. Praise be to God, mention of each one hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur and hath been recorded and inscribed by the Pen of Command in the Book of Deeds. The ocean of loving-kindness hath encompassed all, and the Sun of Grace hath shed its radiance. Qurratu’l-’Ayn Vali-Aqa hath been mentioned repeatedly. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid him, to grant him success, and to manifest that which will cause his traces to spread throughout the earth. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. I convey greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land. God willing, from every utterance from the words of Truth, glorified be His majesty, may they attain unto a new and wondrous life. The favors of God, praise be unto Him, are continuous, and likewise continuous are the life and love and sincerity of those souls. May they hear and attain true joy and be adorned with life everlasting. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you all and upon those who are with you, whether female or male, whether young or old. Praise be to God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>=== START BH00076 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Luminous, the Most Luminous, the All-Luminous!</p>
<p>O H.B.! Hearken unto the call of God from the direction of the Throne through verses sovereign, preeminent and mighty, that thou mayest turn with thy whole being unto thy Lord and cry out with the authority of the Cause between the heavens and the earth, and become so empowered in thyself that should all who dwell on earth contend with thee with sharp and piercing swords, thou wouldst confront them and fear them not, but rather become independent of them through My Name, the Self-Sufficient, the Powerful, the Almighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Verily thou knowest what hath befallen Us, having witnessed during thy journey that which none among all the worlds hath witnessed, for there was no one with sight among Us at the time We migrated unto God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful, except thee. Therefore didst thou perceive and recognize that which none of these pretenders hath recognized. This is of the wine wherewith God hath specially favored thee; drink thou of it in secret within thyself, lest any of these heedless ones should become aware of it. Then render thanks unto God for having acquainted thee with that which none among all created things hath known, and for having taken thy hand with the hands of power and delivered thee from the pit of heedlessness. Verily, there is no God but Him, and He is the Protector of those who are nigh unto God.</p>
<p>By the True God! The cup of joy We have ordained for thee is more excellent than aught else. Therefore drink thou from it, then stand firm in the Cause and be not of the fearful ones. Then observe with the corner of thine eye those who claim “we have believed in the signs of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful,” yet when they were revealed again through His Name, the Exalted, the Almighty, the Great, they fled therefrom, then waxed proud against it, and became more perfidious than the peoples of old, if thou be of those who know.</p>
<p>Say: By the True God! We have borne that which neither the mountains, nor the heavens and all that is therein, nor the earth and all that is thereon, nor the bearers of the mighty Throne could bear. Say: By God! Neither the waves nor the seas, nor the trees nor the fruits, nor what was or what will be, nor the hosts of the unseen from the company of the most exalted ones could endure it. Say: By God! Then did weep the eyes of Grandeur, then the eyes of the people of eternity, then the dwellers of the Paradise of immortality in their crimson chambers, then the inhabitants of the Arks of Glory behind the billows of the sanctified ones. […]</p>
<p>O friend! Soon wilt thou discover that the objections of the opposers will be like unto those raised by the people of the Furqan in the past - nay, even more paltry - and God is sufficient witness unto Me of this. Soon shalt thou hear from them that which was not heard from the learned of the Furqan, nor from their ignorant ones, nor from those who sweep the streets. By the True God, this indeed is a grievous injustice! Say: By God, this is He Who appeared aforetime, and all else was created by My command, if ye be of them that bear witness. Say: Do ye wax proud through that by which your names were exalted and your ranks elevated? By God, this is tyranny from you against God, the Protector, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Have ye not witnessed the sovereignty of God and His power, then the greatness of God and His majesty, then the might of God and His glory? Blinded are your eyes, O company of the heedless! Is there any soul who would dare say ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ or speak in Our presence? Nay, by My mighty and knowing Self! All necks are humbled before My glorious and beauteous countenance, and all heads are bowed before My mighty and impregnable sovereignty. There is treasured within this Youth a melody which, were even less than a needle’s eye thereof to be disclosed, would cause the mountains to crumble, the leaves to wither, the fruits to fall from the trees, faces to bow down, and all countenances to turn toward this King Whom thou beholdest in the form of fire clothed in light, and at times thou seest Him as waves in this surging ocean, and at times thou beholdest Him as the Tree whose roots are firmly fixed in the earth of grandeur and whose branches and twigs have reached unto a station that hath transcended the Mighty Throne, and at times thou findest Him in the form of the Beloved in this Raiment which none among all creation can recognize, and were they to desire to know Him, they would swoon in their spirits, save him who cometh unto his Lord with a sound heart. Thus doth the Herald call out from My right hand, then the Speaker speak from My left, then the Proclaimer cry out from behind Me, and the Spirit from before Me, and the Tongue of God speak from above My head, saying: By God, this is indeed He Who hath been the Intended One from the beginning that hath no beginning, and this is the Face unto which all faces have turned, though they be now unaware. By the True God, whoso denieth this manifest, resplendent, transcendent and luminous bounty should ask his mother concerning his state, for he shall surely return to the nethermost hell. Say: Do ye imagine that if ye deny these verses, your faith in any of God’s Messengers or in ’Ali before can be accounted true? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! By the True God, then would every atom reject you, and beyond them the tongue of power, then the tongue of strength, then the tongue of might, then the tongue of grandeur, then the tongue of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O beloved! Take hold of the hem of the veil with the fingers of power, then raise it in a measure that cannot be reckoned. If thou hearest the clamor of the heedless ones, withdraw thy fingers and leave it as it was, and remain beneath a beauteous veil. Then show patience and endurance, then extend the fingers of might, then unveil therewith the veils of all created things more than thou didst unveil them before. And if the howling of the idolaters be raised, set them down, then flee from the beasts, and remain in impregnable protection. Then dwell in God’s dignity and tranquility, then gird up thy loins in the service of God, then turn unto Him with manifest sovereignty. Then detach thyself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and from such idolaters as these. Then bring forth the fingers of power and might from the bosom which We gave thee before the creation of all things, at a time when Adam was between water and clay. Then rend asunder the veils of the people through the sovereignty whereby all veils and coverings were rent from all things, and stand with wondrous steadfastness, that thereby may be erased the signs of the wayward and the veils of them that have turned aside, who have leaned upon these without any command from Us, if thou be of them that act.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Break the idols and grieve not for what befalls thee, and fear not the hosts of evil. Say: O company of deniers! We fear you not. Whether ye die, or are struck down, or are brought to naught, the Cause of God shall not be frustrated. Indeed hath it been made manifest in truth, however much ye and the idolaters may detest it. Our alternately veiling and unveiling of the Cause is but a token of Our grace unto you and unto all peoples, for some among men are weak and frail and cannot, by reason of the ailment in their eyes, behold the rays of the Sun. Thus do We deal gently with them lest they be among the perished ones.</p>
<p>Say: By God! Neither right nor left, neither question nor answer, shall profit you, if ye be of them that are certain. Say: Ponder within yourselves: when ’Ali came with the truth from the realm of the Spirit with the signs of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, did aught of what the people of the Furqan possessed benefit any one? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Look likewise upon the Bayan, if thou be of them that observe. By My life! Naught of what they had profited them, neither any question nor any answer, and this every person of keen insight well knoweth.</p>
<p>Say: By God! That which had never before appeared hath now been made manifest, and He biddeth you to observe that which ye were commanded in the Book of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. All that ye possess was created by My Word, if ye be of them that comprehend. Say: Today none shall attain except by becoming poor before God - this most holy and resplendent station - and none shall be mentioned save by forgetting himself and all that is in the kingdom of Command and Creation, how much more all that hath been created between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say: Have ye not heard aforetime that His proof is His verses and His being is His vindication? Woe unto you, O heedless ones! By God the True One! Were the veil to be lifted from the face of the Cause, less than can be numbered by any of them that know, there would arise the cry of the Concourse on High, then the shout of the denizens of the realms of eternity, then the holy melody from the retreat of grandeur, that “This is not a mortal in the kingdom; this is none other than a mighty sovereign, wondrous and glorious!” Thus hath God’s proof been perfected, yet the people are so intoxicated with heedlessness that they cannot distinguish left from right. After the appearance of God, can anything in the heavens and earth profit anyone? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds!</p>
<p>O beloved! Sing and warble, clap and drum in the realm of eternity, then in the kingdom of mystery, and turn not unto anything save My radiant and luminous Beauty. Thus have We imparted unto thee that whereof a single letter would suffice to enrich all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, were they to remain steadfast in their love for their Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. And upon thee and upon them that know be the Spirit.</p>
<p>Then remind Javad of that which the Pen of Command now maketh mention - a remembrance whereby the pavilion of holiness was raised up and the Sun was established upon a throne of magnificent glory. Then give him to drink from the cup We gave thee, that his heart may be assured thereby and he may be of the thankful ones. Say: We showed thee in a dream that which will assure thy soul and thy spirit, if thou be of them that know. Interpret thy vision as God hath interpreted, then cross over the path like the passing of a cloud, and turn not unto any of the idolaters. From him in whose heart thou findest not My love, flee from him, avoid him, and maintain a great distance. And if thy self opposeth thee in this, sever thyself from it and be in sure certainty. Say: By God! The balance is none other than My love - this is a mercy unto them that are nigh, and a punishment and scourge unto the idolaters.</p>
<p>Then remind the Merciful One of the glad-tidings of God, the Most High, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise. Say: Thou hast attained the presence of God yet recognized Him not, and wert among the heedless. Therefore, beseech God to aid thee in recognizing Him, to make thee know the Manifestation of His Essence, and to deliver thee from those who are lost in idle fancies. O Rahim! Shun such as these, and associate not with them nor with any of those who would lead astray. Turn thy heart toward the horizon of the Spirit, then detach thyself from all the worlds. Thus do We teach thee that which shall make thee independent of all created things. What thou didst send hath come before Us, and We have accepted it as a mercy from Our presence unto thee, that thou mayest be among the thankful.</p>
<p>Then remind Zaman of that which the Spirit now recalleth from the verses of his Lord, that he may rejoice within himself and be among the God-fearing at a time when most people depart from the fields of righteousness, turning away from Him in Whom they had believed. Thus doth the Spirit make mention of them lest they be among those who turn aside. Say: O servant! Read what We have sent down unto thee aforetime, then inhale from its ink the musk-scented fragrances from the tresses of God, the Supreme, the Mighty. Then act according to what is therein. By God! Through it are gladdened the eyes of the denizens of the Paradise of Firdaws and the people of the Holy Paradise, if ye be of those who know.</p>
<p>Then make mention of him who is named Akbar after Ali, and give him glad tidings of that wherewith the Spirit giveth tidings in this gleaming, luminous and praiseworthy breast. Say: O servant! We have previously sent thee that of which a single letter outweigheth all that hath been created in the heavens and earths. Preserve it, then read it in those moments when thou findest thyself detached from all who are on earth, that it may draw thee to the sacred station, the seat of glorious might. What thou didst send before hath come before Us. God will surely reward thee with the best of what He possesseth, for He is the Protector of the doers of good. Know thou that God accepteth not from His servants - this is of His grace unto His creatures, for He is independent of all worlds. Beware lest thou associate with those in whose hearts thou findest hatred for this Youth. Shun such as these and be not of those who would companion with them. Let God, thy Lord, suffice thee, for He will make thee independent of all else. There is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command. All things are preserved with Him in a guarding tablet.</p>
<p>Then remind Ali in Qaf of that which the Ancient Being commandeth thee at a time when all who are immersed in the depths of eternity, all that was and will be, circle round about Him, if ye be of those who know. Say: O servant! Be steadfast in the Cause of God and fear no one. Put thy trust in My Beauty, the Shining, the Holy, the Luminous. And if thy self opposeth thee in this, detach thyself from it and be not of the patient ones.</p>
<p>Then make mention of Hasan from Our presence, that he may rejoice in that which hath flowed in his name from this musk-scented, wondrous, mighty, singular, eternal, ancient, brilliant and radiant ink. Say: O servant! Act according to that which thou hast been commanded in the Preserved Tablet which We sent unto thee, and be not of those who sit still. Ascend with thy spirit to the holy heights and fear no one. Put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: By God the Truth! The Night Journey hath returned in its entirety, were ye of those who perceive.</p>
<p>Then remind the son of Nabil from Us, that thou mayest find in his face the radiance of delight. Say: O servant, tarry not in this Cause, and follow not anyone therein. Then behold with the primal gaze the proofs of the Messengers. By God, the Truth, He Who was to be made manifest in the year sixty hath appeared, and this proof of His hath filled the East and the West. When thy father hesitated in this Cause, he attained not unto that which he desired, and God cut him off from what lay with Him and returned him to dust with great regret. God did this only to awaken you, yet ye perceived it not and were among the heedless. However, God forgave his transgressions and expiated his misdeeds. Verily He forgiveth whom He willeth and chastiseth whom He willeth. The decree is His alone. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth.</p>
<p>Say: O servant, have mercy upon thyself, dispute not the signs of God, and be not of them that join partners with Him. Say: By God, were We to lift the veil from the face of the Cause, ye would surely rend your bodies, but We have concealed the Cause according to what was ordained in the Tablets by the Pen of God, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing. And thou, O friend, if thou findest not from him the sweet fragrance of love, then cut thyself off from him, turn not unto him, and set thy face toward thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>Then glorify in the presence of Ismail, who hummeth around the Fire in the heights that attract unto them the hearts of the monotheists. Say: O servant, strip thyself of all veils, then enter into the Fire, for it is light and mercy unto thee and unto the sincere ones. Then shatter the idols of self and passion belonging to those who disbelieved and joined partners with God after claiming faith in God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Merciful. Say: By God, your tongues curse you and your limbs disavow you, O company of the heedless! Say: O servant, deliver the command of thy Lord, grieve not over anything, and walk not in the paths of them that fancy vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, Ali hath appeared in another garment. Verily in the Kingdom of Names He was called Husayn, and in the Realm of Eternity by Baha, and in the Heaven of Mystery by this Name that hath appeared upon the Temple of the Youth. Blessed be God, the Best of creators! Say: O concourse of men! By God, the Truth, the Manifestation of Destiny hath appeared in this Most Sublime Vision with such adornment as hath bewildered the hearts of all possessed of intelligence and vision. Say: O company of them that join partners with God! In what direction will ye flee? By God, there is no escape for anyone save by detaching himself from all that he possesseth and clinging to this most luminous and pearly cord.</p>
<p>Say: By God, He is the Most Great Sign among you and the Beauty of God within you. He is the Hidden Mystery and the Subduing Power of God over them that join partners with Him, and His subduing power is more severe and bitter. Say: Through Him doth God chastise those who denied the signs of God and then destiny itself. Say: Flee unto God, your Lord, ascribe no partners unto Him, for unto Me is the final goal. Say: Were We to will it, We would create a new creation, for verily We have power over all things. All things lie within the grasp of Our power, and this is known to everyone possessed of knowledge and thought.</p>
<p>Say: O people, if ye deny these verses, then by what testimony did ye believe in Ali before? Consider this, O concourse of the red ones! Say: Naught shall profit you this Day save that ye believe in Him in Whom ye believed before, then in what hath been sent down from Him of Tablets and Scripture.</p>
<p>O Munib, cast upon that servant what this renowned Pen hath cast upon thee, that he may stand firm in himself in such wise that neither the opposition of any opposer nor the prevention of one who hath transgressed against God and then disbelieved shall hinder him. Then remind from Our presence the beloved one who journeyed unto God and attained His presence and heard His melodies and was among the people of vision. Say: Blessed are thine eyes and thine ears if thou knowest their worth in that they have heard and seen what the eyes of those who turned to God and then turned away and shunned that which shone forth from the Dayspring of holiness through this resplendent, sanctified, most pure Beauty have not seen. And thou, O servant, grieve not when the clamor of the idolaters is raised. Beware lest thou be disturbed or be of them that flee. Say: By God! The Greatest Trump hath appeared in this Trumpet that hath spoken the truth and then sounded, and proclaimeth in the loudest voice between earth and heaven that “With Me is the fixed abode.” O people! Forge not lies against God, your Creator, and deny not after the veil hath been rent asunder and He hath appeared. Beware lest ye be occupied with the world or anything prevent you from entering this vast, fathomless, overwhelming Ocean. They that have believed in God and His signs, these have ascended unto God and shall inherit gardens and rivers, and they that have disbelieved and associated partners with God, these shall enter into fire and flames, and beyond that God shall seize them with His might and render them like dry stubble penned up. Thus hath God ordained their sins as recompense for their sins. Woe unto them and unto him who hath plotted and betrayed, and blessed is he who is content with his Lord’s good-pleasure and who, when the verses of his Lord are recited unto him, believeth and giveth thanks.</p>
<p>Then remind the merciful one after the servant with what We have mentioned in the Tablet, that he may draw nigh with his whole being unto the holy shore and be of them that reflect, who ponder the Cause of God and follow what hath been sent down from Him of judgment and warning. Say: O servant, cast away all that preventeth thee from entering the sanctuary of grandeur, for this is better for thee than all that hath been created and ordained. Be thou one who crieth out between the heavens and the earth that thou mayest be of them who have striven in the ways of God and then helped. Say: We have created the heavens and the earth for Our Cause. By God! This is indeed Our Cause which hath been made manifest in truth, and none knoweth it save everyone possessed of insight and wisdom. Thus have We inspired thee and cast upon thee that thou mayest follow what thou hast been commanded in the Tablet and be of them that are endued with vision.</p>
<p>Then remind the letter Ha’ which appears at the end of Names of that which the Dove of Holiness doth warble, that perchance souls may be drawn by its melodies. Verily have We made mention of it at the end, that it might ascend unto the Sadratu’l-Muntaha and abide beneath its shade. Say: By God! The Tree hath overshadowed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed is he who dwelleth nigh unto it. Say: The Sun hath dawned from the horizon of holiness, and by its light are illumined the denizens of the most exalted Paradise. Blessed is he who is illumined by its radiance. Say: From the hills of holiness hath wafted the musk-laden breeze, and by it have the temples of pre-existence been perfumed. Happy is he who is scented by its fragrance. The Moon of the Cause hath appeared in the midst of heaven, manifesting in the form of fullness with white radiance, and ye, O concourse of the near ones, be dazzled by its splendor. Say: The Throne hath been established behind the pavilion of grandeur, and around it circle the embodiments of beauty with chalices of everlasting life. Blessed is he who attaineth unto their dewdrops. Say: Beauty hath unveiled the Maiden of Immortality with a glance that pierceth the heart. Blessed is he who is struck by her gaze. Say: The Voice of God hath been raised from the sanctuary of eternity, and the hearts of the knowing have been attracted by its melodies. Say: O My Name! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the holy precinct in the melodies of thy Lord, and fear no one, but put thy trust in God, thy Lord. Verily, He will protect thee from the evil ones and their harm. Beware lest thou withhold thyself from that for which thou wert created, and be not of them who denied the signs of God after their revelation. Say: Today naught profiteth anyone save through My love, and to this testify the dwellers of the holy pavilion and the tongues that lie beyond it. As for those who have turned away from the light of the Face, God will blacken their faces like unto a raven’s wing and will torment them with the fire of remoteness and its flames. Say: He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, then established His throne upon the water, then suspended the water in the air, that ye might know God’s handiwork Who hath perfected the creation of all things, and that ye might reflect upon it and upon the bounties He hath ordained in the earth. Say: O people! This is indeed the Good that was promised you in the Nine, and concerning it God took a covenant from all atoms. Blessed is the soul that fulfilleth its covenant. Say: The pavilions of eternity have been raised up, and ye, O people of the Bayan, deprive not yourselves thereof, but dwell in their precincts. By God! The Tree of Baha hath yielded fruit in this garden which hath appeared in the form of the square in the shape of the triangle, and ye, O people of the ark of eternity, draw nigh unto it and partake of its fruits. Say: O people! Do ye deny the signs of God while ye read what was revealed before them? Woe unto you for what Satan hath made your deeds seem fair in your eyes. Thus do We cast upon you from the signs of the Cause that ye might arise from the dust of heedlessness and be nourished by that which descendeth from the clouds of holiness and its waters. Thus doth the Pen of the Cause counsel every perceptive soul. Say: The ships of eternity have anchored upon the crimson sea. Blessed is he who holdeth fast to the holy cords thereof that he might abide in its eternity. Say: By God! This is indeed the sea that hath overwhelmed all created things, wherein saileth the holy ark which the Spirit of Noah hath fashioned for this Youth, by Whose name the reins of the universe and its motion are held. Say: The seas of pre-existence have surged in this Most Great Ocean, and none hath attained unto its shore, much less its depths, save those who have held fast to that which floweth thereon from the holy vessels and have embarked in My name, the All-Merciful, upon their decks. Say: The Tree of the Spirit hath been raised up upon the Sinai of eternity […]</p>
<p>None hath attained unto its shores, much less unto its depths, save those who have taken hold of the holy Arks that sail thereon, and then mounted them in My Name, the All-Merciful, upon their backs. Say: The Tree of the Spirit hath been raised upon the Sinai of everlasting life, and the Ancient Nightingale warbleth Its sweetest melodies upon its branches. Therefore be silent, O Temples of Glory, that ye may hearken unto It. The Salsabil hath gushed forth from this Tasnim which hath burst forth from the Kawthar of holiness through this Mouth from which flow the waters of eternity. Blessed, then, is he who is overwhelmed by its surging waves. Say: This is the Spirit of God seated upon the throne, and God hath sanctified Its raiment from the touch of the idolaters.</p>
<p>Verily, O beloved one, provide every soul with the fresh, unique and eternal bounties which descend from this heaven that hath been raised up in truth. Beware lest thou transgress the bounds of men, and give to each according to their measure. Verily, one whose taste hath been altered will not distinguish the sweetness of the sweet from the bitter except when their malady is cured. Thus have We created souls in diverse stages. Blessed is the one who recognizeth their stages. Those whose ears are not purified will never delight in the holy melodies. Thus do We impart unto thee tidings of every wisdom. Break thou the seal of the chalice of the All-Merciful through My Name, the Bestower. Then pour forth the water of life which hath been pressed by the fingers of the All-Glorious, that perchance the people of the contingent world might be warmed by its heat and be illumined by its lights and radiance. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them from condition to condition, and We shall expound them as We please in yet other ways, that thou mayest witness the power of thy Lord and fall prostrate before Him. Say: By God the Truth! The glory lieth not in the revelation of verses and their like, but rather in My manifestation between the heavens and earth and amidst these diverse peoples, if ye be of them that see with clear vision. And if thou findest those whose names We have mentioned in the Tablet in a state of joy and delight, waft over them that which hath been diffused from the sweet-scented herbs of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Trusted. Otherwise, seal tight the vial of fragrance lest the idolaters detect its perfume. Then seal it with the holy seal, or with carnelian from Yemen. Beware lest thou spread the signs of God before the idolaters. Then turn away from them and be patient, and grieve not. By God! This is a matter at which all who are in the heavens and earth would swoon, the skins of the proud would shudder, the lands of the Pharaohs would be cleft asunder, the lofty mountains would be crushed, every nursing mother would forget what she nurseth, every pregnant one would cast her burden, and the inhabitants of the heavens and earth would be overcome with intoxication, save him who cometh unto God with a tested heart. Bear thou the Book of God with strength from Us and power from Our presence. Fear not to carry it, nor be dismayed by its weight. Verily, He will protect thee in truth and guard thee from every tribulation and test. No affliction toucheth them that know God but it increaseth their detachment unto God and their longing for that station which God hath sanctified from the doubts of time. And if thou findest thyself alone between the heavens and earth, then be content therewith and with Him Who created them, and be not sorrowful or distressed. Withdraw from those who have disbelieved, then draw nigh unto God. This is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth and whatsoever hath been created in secret or manifest. Purify thy robe from the dust of dominion, then drink from the crimson cup from the Youth of Glory, that He may render thee detached from the world and whatsoever is therein of ornaments and possessions. Say: O people! See ye no differences in what hath been sent down from Us, for all the verses have been sent down from the Mighty, the Strong, from the dominion of eternity, and they differ according to their stations, if ye be of them that understand. Thus do We cast upon you from the mysteries of the Cause, lest your feet slip from this exalted and manifest path. Thou shalt not conceal the Cause of thy Lord to such an extent that the fire of God would be extinguished in all else, nor proclaim it in such wise that adversity would touch thee. Seek thou a way between these two. Then know that this Beauty hath been so tried among these people that He wisheth either to withdraw Himself from them or to soar to the holy heights in the original homeland. By God! At every moment I have fallen under the claws of the malicious […]</p>
<p>Be not loud in speaking of him whom adversity hath touched, but seek therein a middle way. Know thou that this Beauty hath been so sorely tried among these people that He desireth either to withdraw Himself from them or to wing His flight unto the sacred heights of His native land. By God! At every moment I have been caught in the talons of the malicious and the hateful, and I find no helper save God Who created Me and all things, and Who sent Me with the authority of His Cause over land and sea and over the dwellers of cities. Say: When We related but a letter of the vision unto the people of blindness, they could not bear it and cast Us into the pit in this darksome night. Thus do We impart unto thee from the secrets of the Cause that which was concealed and treasured. Know thou that of those who were there, some turned away from God and denied His signs, while others believed in their Lord and were among those who were saved and secured. Those who had veiled their faces in women’s garments out of fear for themselves, then emerged from behind the wine-jars and opposed this most manifest and hidden Beauty. Say: O people! Fear ye God and dispute not with the Manifestation of His Self, but turn unto Him with befitting submissiveness. By God! The hidden mystery of God hath appeared from this Treasury, and the concealed symbol of God hath emerged from this Hiding Place. O people! Give thanks unto God Who created you from a fluid poured forth and made known unto you the paths of holiness through what He hath sent down unto you of laws and ordinances, that ye might follow the ways of guidance in this Path which hath appeared with truth. Beware lest ye differ concerning it or be in doubt about the meeting with your Lord. Draw nigh unto Him with your hearts, for this is better for you than all that hath appeared and is hidden.</p>
<p>This is the Surih of the Companions which We have sent down in truth and dispatched unto thee that thou mayest read it unto those in whose faces thou perceivest the radiance of the All-Merciful, and who, when they hear the verses of God, wing their flight unto the Divine Lote-Tree in this holy court. And when thou seest Victory, make mention of him at the uttermost end through that which hath now been sent down from the heaven of glory, that he may remember within himself and be of them that believed and were guided. Say: O Victory! Aid thy Lord as thou art able in this victory which hath appeared in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be God Who created, then fashioned. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God, thy Lord, in such wise that nothing in the heavens and earth shall prevent thee, that thou mayest be of those who fulfilled their covenant. Say: O people! Do ye dispute with the Spirit concerning that which He witnessed and saw, or concerning what He heard of the divine melodies in the most holy, most manifest, most glorious Kingdom? By God! He hath stood firm in such manner that all humanity could not prevent Him, and all who are in the heavens and earth were as but a handful of dust before Him. Say: Were He to utter but a single word, it would be more exalted than all that hath been sent down in the kingdom of command and creation, and none knoweth this save those possessed of understanding. Say: He hath established Himself upon the Throne, then ascended - this is grievous unto the idolaters and unto him who disbelieved and transgressed, then turned away and became wretched. Say: O company of the malicious! Die in your wrath, for the Sun hath shone forth with the lights of God in the midst of the morning, illuminating all who are in the heavens and earth save every base one who went astray and was blinded. Thus do We relate unto you from the true stories, O people of wisdom. Say: One glance toward Him is better than whatsoever is in the Concourse on High and the kingdom of the hereafter and the first. Blessed is he who hath attained the presence of the Throne and beheld the Most Beautiful Perspective and heard from the holy melody of his Lord’s most great verses.</p>
<p>O Nasr! Hearken unto that which is revealed unto thee from the Supreme Dominion. Beware lest thou fear anyone; turn thy face unto thy Lord and be of them whom the remembrance profiteth. Be patient at the time when the heaven of the Cause is cleft asunder and the earth of will is rent, and the clamor is raised by all who have turned away and gone astray. Say: By God! He whose heart is not purified from whatsoever beareth the name of all created things shall never have this most luminous and most pure Beauty imprinted therein. Sanctify the mirrors of your hearts, O peoples of the earth, then ascend unto the station which God hath ordained to be beyond the mention of the two bows or nearer still. Say: Verily, He speaketh at all times that which the Spirit hath spoken within His most elevated breast. Say: By God! He speaketh not of His own desire, but rather speaketh that which the Mighty One of the Cause inspireth Him with from the signs of His Lord, the Most Great. Say: He is even now at the Supreme Horizon, and verily He is the Primal Beauty clothed in the raiment of the Latter Beauty. Glorified be His most exalted Self! Through Him have the standards of the Cause been raised in the Kingdom of Names and the pavilions of glory been planted in the dominion of the divine cloud. Say: O people! Return unto Him, for with Him is the ultimate end. By God! He is the Paradise of Refuge at the Sacred Tree at the appearance of the revelations of light from this most luminous and most glorious Beauty. Thus did the penetrating vision never waver from that which it witnessed and beheld from the sovereignty of its Lord, the Most Manifest, the Most Hidden. Say: Were He to remove the veil from the face of but one word from His presence, the earth would be rent asunder and the heavens on high would be cleft, but He dealeth gently with His servants lest their hearts be troubled and they return to the abode of wrath in the nethermost abyss. Fear thou no one. Remind the people of the signs of thy Lord, for this is His victory in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and thus doth He strengthen thee through remembrance, and unto Him returneth all remembrance. Thus have We caused nineteen rivers to flow from every letter of this Tablet. Blessed is he who thirsteth and seeketh to quench his thirst. And when We completed the Tablet, there descended from the dominion of eternity yet other signs of thy Lord, the Most Great, that every noble mind might be reminded thereby. And We shall mention in the Tablet the remembrance of some of the loved ones of God whom We have not mentioned before, that God’s grace might reach all atoms and every possessor of grace and understanding. Therefore, remind those whose names the Pen of the Cause hath not moved to inscribe, if thou findest them mindful of their Lord; otherwise, leave them to themselves, then turn away from every doubting denier. Say: O ye people! Rejoice in these days wherein God hath come in the shadows of the Spirit and the Face hath shone forth from behind the veil.</p>
<p>Then remind Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, whose name was in thy Book, of that which the Pen of Decree hath recorded in the dominion of accomplishment before his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, that he may ascend in his soul unto the sacred heights in this Ascension which hath appeared in the Temple of the Youth, and be amongst those who have humbled themselves and turned unto God. Say: O servant! Detach thyself from all that thy passions desire, then hold fast unto the Most Great Handle within thyself, and this is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth - yet none comprehend this save every steadfast believer, and none understand it except those endowed with insight. Say: Glorify the name of thy Lord and be in a state of rapture and ecstasy from that which We gave thee to drink of the Wine of Life in holy and wondrous chalices. Verily, We made those letters to be chalices for wondrous attributes - We give to drink therefrom the wine of verses unto whomsoever We will among Our servants. Say: From Us hath grace appeared and unto Us shall all return on the Day of Return. By one drop thereof the temples of all created things are brought to life, and thus hath Our mercy preceded all things and encompassed all particles from Paradise to the lowest point of dust. Verily, those who have not attained unto the holy drops from this chalice are more contemptible in God’s sight than the creation of a fly, for they have denied God’s favor and disputed His signs after their revelation, and followed every idolatrous liar. Say: O people! Do ye call upon those unto whom God hath given no authority, and forsake the Lord of Lords? Evil indeed is that which ye have chosen for yourselves as protectors besides God. God shall soon punish you with His wrath, for He is mighty in His grasp and severe in His punishment. And among the idolaters was one who was there and was not content that We should name Ourself by any of the names, and thus did he transgress against God Who created him and fashioned him - and the transgression of the idolaters leadeth only to ruin. Say: O people! All names return unto their kingdom which returneth unto My Cause that was created by My Word, and this is known to every soul that hath believed in the Day of Reckoning. Say: The Sun hath dawned from the horizon of glory, and thereby the heaven of pride was cleft asunder, and the earth of rancor was split, and the mountain of stillness passed away as the passing of clouds. Thus have We cast upon thee from every tiding that thou mayest remember within thyself and remind the people of that which We have inspired thee, that perchance souls may be cleansed from ailments and be made wholesome. Say: O concourse of earth! Seek ye victory in these days and let not the multitude of the idolaters frighten you. Thus doth the Pen of Glory counsel you from the presence of a Mighty, All-Attracting One. Know ye that victory lieth not in drawing the sword, but in purifying your souls, O company of companions! By God! Should a soul detach itself from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and arise for that which God hath willed, God would through it render victorious His sincere loved ones, and the standards of the idolaters would vanish from all parties. Say: By God! Victory is your detachment from all save God and your steadfastness in My love on the Day wherein the feet of the eloquent shall slip, and from the thicket of hypocrisy shall emerge a band of wolves who have disbelieved and turned away and were in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord, after He had appeared from the holy horizon with scrolls and a Book.</p>
<p>Say: O Concourse of holiness! Draw forth the sword of wisdom from the sheath of utterance and thereby aid your Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest ye spread corruption in the land after it hath been set in order. Fear God, unto Whom all matters return, both in the beginning and in the end. Should the idolaters advance against you, scatter them through a word from Us, not with your swords. Break not your covenant with that which ye have been commanded in the Book. Stand firm, O people, in the path and be steadfast in the Cause at this cornerstone with fire and attraction. Say: If ye will not stand firm in the path, God will soon raise up a people who will stand firm in the Cause and make mention of Him with passionate longing, yearning and attraction, whom nothing in the heavens or on earth shall deter. Upon them shall the angels and the Spirit send down their blessings, then the people of the Concourse on high, then they that dwell within the pavilions of nearness behind the veil. And there is nothing that shall not celebrate their names and seek to draw nigh unto God through them. Say: By God! Through their names the bell shall ring out, the cock of Paradise shall crow, and the rebeck shall sing. Thus have the words of thy Lord been fulfilled in truth and justice. None can change the words of thy Lord, and none shall comprehend this save every soul that is enduring and goodly.</p>
<p>=== END BH00076 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00077 ===</p>
<p>O my honored friend, Jinab-i-Samandar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God! May you be considered beneath His most luminous gaze.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Grandeur!</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart and the one remembered in my soul! A single drop from the cloud of the mercy of the Lord of Lords hath been sent down and floweth, and in every place a decree therefrom is made manifest. In the sea of the hearts of the people of understanding, the pearls of the knowledge of the Beloved of all possibility have become existent, yet in hardened hearts and darkened lands, naught else appeareth. Glory be to God! This evanescent servant observeth that in the days of God, each and every thing hath been and shall be a balance. The blessed word that hath shone forth from the dawning-place of the mouth of the All-Merciful hath been God’s balance, whereby all things have been measured. Likewise, should one observe with the eye of insight the deeds and actions that have appeared from the Source of the Cause, one would witness in every day, nay in every moment, the balance of Truth, the proof of Truth, the power of Truth, and the might of Truth, and would be bewildered by that which appeareth from the Truth. How strange that eyes which behold the rays of the sun remain unaware! The Most Great Ocean is manifest and visible before all faces, yet they remain bereft of it and continue to thirst. The fire hath been kindled, yet they see it not. The Divine Lote Tree hath spoken, yet they hear not. The Cry hath been raised, yet they remain asleep. The horizon of the Cause hath been illumined, yet they turn not toward it. The Self-Subsisting hath arisen, yet they perceive it not. The tongue of utterance warbleth at every ear, proclaiming “Verily, I am your Most Glorious Lord,” yet all remain heedless save whom God willeth, our Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the Protecting. Their desires have prevented them from the bounty of God and His generosity, and from the mercy of God and His loving-kindness. This servant interpreteth these desires as referring to those divines who have gone astray and led others astray, who have become corrupt and corrupted others in the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Glory be to God! They have not reflected, even for a moment, upon the oppression of the Prophets - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Them - to understand what was the cause and reason for the people’s opposition, objection, vituperation and denial of those holy Lights. They slay Husayn and then weep for him; they deny God yet enter the houses of worship in His name. By Thy life, O thou who art enkindled with the fire of the love of God! I am amazed, and all things are amazed, at what these people have committed in the days of God, the Lord of all names and the Sovereign of both the beginning and the end. The example of this evanescent servant is like that of a fish swimming in the sea of love for God’s chosen ones, ever crying out “Is there more?” For whenever I desire to send a petition to that Beloved and attempt to be brief, I find it impossible, for the tongue of love whispers in the ear of the pen “Hasten! Hasten!” and says “Beware lest thou pause!” Indeed, the attraction of love hath ever had and shall have such effects as cannot be described by the pen. I beseech Him, exalted be He, every morning and evening, nay in every day and every hour and every minute, to assist thy honor in His remembrance and praise and in serving His Cause among His servants with wisdom, with wisdom, and to make thee drink that which will cause to flow from thy tongue that which will attract the hearts of others. Verily, He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Wise. O my beloved! Have not these utterances and writings and explanations and calls appeared as they ought? […]</p>
<p>Let none suppose that these calls have not been raised in a befitting manner, or that the denial of permission by the people of the world, due to their own vain imaginings, hath caused them to be deprived thereof. Nay, by God! There have not been, nor are there now, ears worthy to hear. The ear that hath been engaged in hearing unseemly mention will assuredly be deprived of hearkening unto the divine utterance that appeareth for the sake of God. With the utmost lowliness and supplication, I implore and beseech the All-Possessing One that He may awaken those who slumber, raise up those who remain in their graves, and cause them to speak forth His praise and glorification. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>After perusing thy noble letter number 10 which thou hadst sent to him who beareth the name of Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, it was brought to the Most Great Presence and presented before His Countenance. He said: “Praise be to God, they have been and are successful. From the beginning of the Cause until now, they have spoken in praise of the Wronged One of the horizons and have arisen to serve Him. The sweet-scents of His love are wafting, and the degrees of their sincerity are evident. God willing, they shall ever be adorned with the raiment of His special favors. The Supreme Pen hath testified to his acceptance, his turning to God, his presence, his attentiveness, his remembrance and his praise. Verily, nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He, verily, is the All-Wise, the All-Informed. We send Our greetings upon him and his brother and those who have attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of all worlds.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali! Thou didst hear My call when thou wert present in My Most Great Prison. Thou didst witness and observe that from which most of the servants were debarred. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Reckoning, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon you and upon your family and those who are with you, from the presence of the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>We make mention of Javad, from whom We have perceived the fragrance of steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped, that he may rejoice in My remembrance and speak forth My praise amongst the servants. O Javad! The Lord of creation maketh mention of thee at this time wherein He walketh and speaketh. Verily, there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Be thou steadfast, vigilant, speaking forth remembrance at eventide and at dawn. O Javad! By God’s life! Were people to become aware, as they ought to be, of the ocean of divine mercy and the sea of the compassion of the Eternal Sovereign, they would arise as befitteth this Day and would speak forth as beseemeth this Day. By My life! Were they to become aware of even less than a hair’s breadth of the outpourings from the clouds of divine favors, they would turn towards the Most Great Scene and circle round about it. They have not been, nor are they now, aware of the purpose of God and that which is concealed within the treasury of His grace and knowledge. God willing, may the awareness of His chosen ones deliver all from heedlessness and make them aware. Glorified and exalted is He above what they describe and what they say and what they know.</p>
<p>O Ahmad, rejoice in My glad-tidings! Verily thou art mentioned in My presence, at the seat of My throne. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of God who have drunk from the Living Waters and who dwell in that house, and say: In days of joy, grief is not permitted. Praise be to God that ye are holding fast to the cord of God’s love and are clinging to the hem of His grace. By My life! Were that which hath been ordained for you in the Kingdom of God, your Lord, to be unveiled, ye would be seized with such joy as would transcend the power of the pens to describe. Today each soul can attain whatsoever it seeketh. Observe outwardly how many souls have built mosques and churches and bridges that their good name might endure on earth and that they might receive their reward from God. Likewise souls who, with a hundred thousand hopes and wishes, supplications and entreaties, have begged the All-Bountiful for children that some trace of them might remain on earth - yet they know not whether that trace will be righteous or otherwise. But in these days if a soul attaineth unto the recognition of the Truth, uttereth His praise and is enabled to serve Him, his mention and praise will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Blessed is the soul whose mention and praise hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. That mention shall not be erased by the passage of ages and cycles, but shall ever remain fresh and verdant in the meadows of divine utterance. Give the friends of that land to drink of the choice wine of remembrance, that the remembrance may gather them together unto a single mention, a single cause, and a single word. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of the Wronged One in His Most Great Prison.</p>
<p>[The remainder appears to be correspondence regarding receipt of letters and subsequent responses, including a tablet revealed to one Himmat-’Ali, and reference to another believer. The final line reads “He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth.”]</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thou hast turned thy face unto My countenance from thy station, and the Wronged One hath turned toward thee from this glorious horizon. Know thou the value of this blessed word. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings, which hath no peer or likeness in all creation, and with which the precious jewels of the earth can neither compare nor equate! Thy petition was read before the Wronged One. Blessed art thou, for from thee hath wafted the fragrance of the love of God, and thou hast turned unto Him after the turning away of all on earth save whom God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath willed. Blessed is the tongue that hath spoken My remembrance, the heart that hath won My love, the eye that hath turned toward My horizon, the pen that hath been honored to write My verses, and the foot that hath stood firm upon My straight path.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that place! Hold fast to the cord of My love and cling to the hem of My providence which hath encompassed the worlds. Take the chalices of knowledge in My Name, then drink therefrom. Thus doth the Lord of Names command you while in His mighty prison.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Convey My greetings unto the faces of those who have turned unto the One, the All-Informed. Likewise convey greetings unto the handmaidens of God. The maidservants of the Truth who have turned unto the Kaaba of Being and have attained to service have been and shall ever be mentioned before the Throne. The glory be upon thee and thy family from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Know then, O Muhammad, that thy Lord loveth His loved ones and their presence before His throne, but the heedless have come between Him and them. Thus hath the matter been decreed, and command is in the hands of God, the Mighty, the Great. He writeth for whomsoever desireth the reward of meeting Him. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Almighty. God hath forgiven thy father and thy mother. Rejoice in thy Lord’s bounty and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>[The document continues with further messages to other individuals, including Mashhadi Ali-Akbar and Hibatullah, offering divine guidance, encouragement, and exhortations to steadfastness and unity.]</p>
<p>O Abdul-Baqi, Abdul-Husayn and Abdul-Ali! He saith, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Speaker! Blessed is the state of those souls who, in the days of the Most Merciful, have drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge and attained the fragrances of His raiment. Were all who dwell on earth to recognize that from which they are veiled this day, all would turn towards the supreme horizon and cling to the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>O Baqi! That which thou didst submit hath attained the hearing of the Best Beloved of the world, and from the tongue of the Lord of Eternity thou art mentioned in these resplendent words. Know thou the value of this bounty. By the life of God! Nothing in creation can compare with it. While time remaineth and breath endureth, occupy thyself with the remembrance of the Friend and hold fast unto His commandments. God willing, mayest thou ever be confirmed in the good-pleasure of the Friend, gaze toward the direction of the Friend, and stand firm in service to the Friend.</p>
<p>We counsel all the people of that land to show forth love and unity, that all may gather at the divine spring and uttereth the blessed Word. For if they be not mindful of this exalted and most high station, regret shall seize them, by the Lord of all worlds!</p>
<p>O Abdul-Husayn! Goodly is thy name and pleasing is thy mention, for both thy name and thy remembrance have attained the Sacred Court. The Supreme Pen at all times maketh mention of His loved ones and commandeth all to that which conduceth to glory, elevation and immortality. Blessed is the soul that hath acted and attained unto that which its Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath desired. We heard thy call and graciously answered thee. God willing, through the breezes of the utterance of the Most Merciful, mayest thou be steadfast in the Cause and act according to that which the Desired One hath willed.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Ali! Great and blessed is this Day. All who dwell on earth abide beneath the shadow of God’s grace, and divine mercy hath encompassed all. We have forbidden contention, objection, disputation, bloodshed, corruption and whatsoever harmeth the people of the world, that all may rejoice through divine bounty and turn toward the Most Great Ocean. Yet the corrupt ones see their own reflection in the mirrors of creation and imagine all to be like themselves. Vain are their words, their deeds and their imaginings. God willing, in this divine springtime mayest thou be adorned with the ornament of knowledge and act according to that which is beloved. All atoms magnify and make mention of those souls who strive for the unity and concord of the peoples of the world. Blessed are they and unto them a goodly return.</p>
<p>End.</p>
<p>To Abdul-Samad, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah]. This is what the Single, the One, hath revealed in reply:</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>O Abdul-Samad! Thy petition was presented before the Wronged One and the glances of His loving-kindness were directed toward it. Praise be to God, thou hast drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge and partaken of the choice wine of certitude. That which, after recognition, is of supreme importance hath been and ever shall be steadfastness in the Cause of God. God willing, through His grace and bounty, thou shalt possess this quality until the time of ascension. The ocean of steadfastness hath ever possessed and shall possess unlimited pearls. Blessed are they that attain! Blessed are they that act! Blessed are they that know! Grieve thou not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, God of the hosts, Master of the unseen and the seen! I beseech Thee by the Name through which earthquakes have seized all the tribes of the earth, and the heavens were cleft asunder, and the idols lamented, to aid me in that which befitteth Thy days. O my Lord! Thou art He Whose mercy hath preceded all things and Whose grace hath encompassed all. Thou seest me, O my God, standing before Thy gate, hoping for what lieth with Thee of the wonders of Thy bounty. I call upon Thee, and I invoke Thee by Thy Name, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Munificent, the Answerer.</p>
<p>The glory be upon thee and upon thy wife who hath turned unto Him, attained His presence, and called upon her Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Convey unto her My greetings and gladden her with the mention of My remembrance and loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Destiny. He remembereth thee from His Most Great Scene in this Prison which God hath transformed into the Most Pure Palace, despite those who imprisoned Him and denied Him. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. He who ordered My imprisonment now crieth out and lamenteth in torment, while thy Bestowing Lord is in this noble station. Give thanks unto God for what He hath revealed unto thee and unto those whose names thou didst mention and whose petitions thou didst forward - that whereby the hearts of the servants have been attracted. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Informed. We recite the verses while the servant present before the Throne writeth them with a speed that none else can match. Verily thy Lord is the Helper, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones who have cast aside all else but Me, soared in My atmosphere, and spoken My praise amongst My servants. Give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace, My mercy and My generosity that have encompassed the worlds.</p>
<p>His Holiness Muhammad-Husayn - may His sovereignty be exalted:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Friend</p>
<p>O Husayn! Thy petition was presented before the Face and was observed. God willing, thou hast ever been and wilt ever be blessed with the loving-kindness of the Beloved of the worlds and remain turned toward His direction. How excellent is the state of one who hath turned unto Him, how beloved the tongue that hath spoken His praise, how noble the pen that hath been aided to write His verses, and how luminous the heart that hath been illumined with the light of His knowledge. Say:</p>
<p>O my God, my Aim, my Sovereign, my Lord! I beseech Thee to aid me in Thy love and Thy good-pleasure in such wise that I shall move only by Thy leave and speak only what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book through the Pen of Thy Command. O Lord! I am the poor one who hath turned toward the gate of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of Thy bounty and generosity. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Sadiq! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My mighty Throne. He remembereth thee and those who have turned unto Him with clear certitude. Today all friends must fix their gaze upon steadfastness and hold fast unto Him, for the manifestations of negation are many and lie in wait at all times. Most of the people of the earth play as children play. Thus doth the All-Informed make mention. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. At all times occupy yourselves with the remembrance of the All-Merciful and hold fast to the cord of His love.</p>
<p>O servant of God! Your call has attained the presence of the Goal of all the world, and that which you submitted was presented by this servant before His Presence. God willing, may all the friends attain unto acting in accordance with that which the All-Bestowing One hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. In the previous year, the Tablet of Detachment, the Book of Truth, the Tablet of the Balance, and the Tablet of Trustworthiness were sent down from the heaven of will. Blessed are they who have beheld them and succeeded in acting upon them. Each of the friends who have drunk from the wine of the love of the All-Merciful must ever be occupied with that which will cause unity and fellowship among the peoples of the earth. Unite, O My servants, in My Cause, then drink the Kawthar of My utterance from the ocean of My grace. Thus doth God command you, before and after. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Haji Baba, it was presented before the Throne. He said: God willing, through divine grace, may they act in accordance with that which is commanded in the Book. O Samandar! Say: The world and all its ornaments and bounties, its kings and subjects and paupers, shall pass away, and there shall endure that which hath been ordained for God’s chosen ones and His loved ones. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur speak - blessed be they that hear! Let them be occupied, trusting in God. Verily, He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth the good of this world and the next. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. Were souls to become aware of the eternal realm, they would assuredly not be saddened during these two days, or two hours, or two minutes of this world. It behooveth everyone in these days to say:</p>
<p>O God of all beings! I testify with my outer and inner tongue that what is with Thee is better for me than all that is witnessed and seen in the kingdom of creation.</p>
<p>Convey to him greetings from the Tongue of Truth and say: Be not distressed. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>As for the letter of Aqa Mulla Ibrahim to this evanescent servant, if God should will and desire, an answer shall be sent.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Aqa Hasan Kh., it was presented in the Most Great Scene. He said: O Hasan! Give thanks unto God for having attained unto His mention aforetime and in this hour when the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of this exalted prison. The entire world hath departed and shall depart, for God, exalted be His glory, hath made the world like unto a bridge that all may cross over it and attain unto their goal, that is, that they may dwell in the praiseworthy station. The world was not and will never be an abode of permanence. Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid His loved ones that they may ascend at the time of their passing with sanctified and detached hearts. Whosoever attaineth unto this station, his ascension was and shall be a source of joy. However, this ocean is the portion of those who are near and sincere. O Hasan! Grieve not for thy brother. Verily, he hath attained unto the ornament of forgiveness and dwelleth nigh unto the mercy of thy Lord, the Generous. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>In another letter from your honor, a packet from His Holiness Ismu’llah, upon him be all glory and splendor, was received. Letters from him have arrived through other channels as well, but this evanescent servant, due to numerous occupations and other obstacles, has not yet succeeded in submitting a response. God willing, I hope to be able to take the liberty of submitting a response in these days.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Consider how letters arrive from all directions, and this servant’s responses, when submitted, are detailed - some submissions exceeding one volume. Therefore, if this servant were to respond to each believer’s letter every time, these lifetimes would certainly not suffice. Beyond these considerations, there is the writing of verses which this servant is engaged in day and night. Glory be to Him Who strengthened me for this momentous cause, and glory be to Him Who enabled me to accomplish what I never imagined I could achieve. Glorified is He beyond what I or others describe, beyond what I or others mention, and beyond what the tongues of the world express.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about those mentioned individuals going to Jaffa, and that His Honor Jud, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, had spoken these words about having excessive love for him, etc., and that beloved one had written at the end that in truth and fairness, he had maintained and continues to maintain the utmost steadfastness and vigilance in the Cause to the extent of his capacity and strength, and was never concerned with such matters, etc. O my beloved! You spoke truly in mentioning he who arose to serve God and remembered Him for successive years, and for whom the Supreme Pen revealed that which brought joy to hearts and delight to eyes. By God’s life! A fire was ignited in his heart that consumed all else besides God, our Lord, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O beloved of my heart! The fire that is ignited by the love of God has consumed and will consume the mention of anyone besides the Friend. Blessed is he, again blessed is he.</p>
<p>After this explanation was submitted, He said: “He has done what was befitting in the days of his Lord, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing.” And He said: “Today the relationship with God is established. Blessed is the soul that holds fast to it, for it is among the most exalted of creation in a clear Book.” As commanded, His Honor Ismu’l-Jud, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, sent his letter to Jaffa. No mention of anything unfavorable has thus far descended from the heaven of will regarding this matter, and He has shown and continues to show favor.</p>
<p>Regarding your mention of His Honor Aqa Siyyid (J) and His Honor ’Andalib, upon them both be the glory of God, and other friends, responses to their submissions have been revealed and will be sent. May they hold fast to the cord of teaching, but with the wisdom that the All-Wise has decreed in the Book. I beseech our Lord, the Most Merciful, to assist them and strengthen them in such remembrance that will cause all faces to turn toward the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O Samandar! Thou hast attained unto God’s mention after having recognized Him and hast drunk the living waters from the hands of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Thou art he who attained the presence of the Countenance and stood before the Door and wast honored with that which is inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. We make mention of those who have believed in thy region and give them glad tidings of that which is ordained for them in the Kingdom of their Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. We counsel them to fear God, for through it His Cause, the mighty, the wondrous, is uplifted. Say: Hold fast unto that which exalteth My Cause and manifesteth My sovereignty amongst My servants. Thus doth command you He from Whom is a preserving Tablet. Verily, those who turn away this Day are in heedlessness, in loss, in hypocrisy, in remoteness, and in evident doubt. The world hath been confounded by the deeds of those peoples who have forsaken My path and followed the ways of Satan.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention once again of him who is named Muhammad-’Ali, who hath attained unto My mention and praise, who hath turned towards My face and hath written down that which was sent down from My heaven, that he may rejoice in the bounty of his Lord, the Generous. He hath turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and hath attained the Most Glorious Vision - the station round which circle the Concourse on High and the near-stationed angels. Thus hath surged the ocean of My loving-kindness and wafted the fragrance of My mercy, yet most of the people are heedless.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We love to make mention of My loved ones in Alif and Shin, that they may give thanks unto God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. O My loved ones in those regions! By the True One, the Ancient Beauty hath turned towards you from this glorious, exalted Station, which hath been named by all names in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Hold fast unto that which shall profit you in the Hereafter and in this world. Thus doth your Lord, the Faithful Counselor, admonish you. Beware lest the affairs of earth shut you out from the Creator of heaven, Who hath come with mighty sovereignty. This is the Day whereon the heaven hath been cleft asunder, the earth hath been rent, and all who dwell in the kingdoms of creation and command have been thunderstruck, save him whom the hand of God’s power hath protected, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O My loved ones! Blessed are ye for having turned towards My Most Sublime Horizon, cast away all else beside Me, and taken that which hath been sent down from My glorious, exalted Kingdom. Know ye the value of these days and act according to that which ye have been commanded in the Book of God. By My life! It shall profit you in all the worlds of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>God willing, gaze ye with utmost joy and fragrance toward the horizon of the All-Merciful. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of utterance that whosoever hath turned toward it hath found himself free and sanctified from the world’s defilements. In all conditions ye must be mindful of that which exalteth the Cause of God, and today’s deeds must be such that every soul may inhale from them the sweet savors of holiness and detachment. Ye must strive with the utmost dedication to ponder and act upon that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. He hath verily guided you to the straight path and manifested unto you that which ye were promised in the Book. Blessed are ye and blessed is he who was martyred in My path in the Prison of Ta. We testify that he was with Me and circled round My throne at eventide and at dawn. We send Our greetings upon him, upon you, upon his son, and upon those who have attained unto the knowledge of God in the final end.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of My loved ones in Kaf and Lam (Kaladarih), that they may praise God, the Lord of all beings. Give thanks unto God for having aided you to turn towards this Ocean, from whose waves can be heard: ‘There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bountiful.’ I created creation for My knowledge - among them are those who turned away and those who turned towards Me. And he who turned towards Me is assuredly of the people of Paradise in the Sacred Scriptures and Tablets. Rejoice in My days and hold fast unto that wherefrom appear the pearls of detachment amidst the concourse of religions. Reflect upon God’s mercy and His grace. He maketh mention of you from this station and magnifieth His favor upon your faces. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>The Sun of Revelation is shining and the Ocean of Utterance is surging. Blessed is the soul that hath not deprived itself and hath attained unto the boundless effusions of God in this wondrous springtime. O friends! The Tongue of the All-Merciful saith: Let not this opportunity slip from your grasp and count these moments as precious. Thus doth command you the Lord of the Day of Reckoning.</p>
<p>May His Holiness Haji Aqa Baba be blessed with divine favors, occupied with the mention of the Friend, and acting as behooveth him. The Glory be upon him and upon them and upon the handmaidens of God in that place, and upon whosoever hath heard and answered his Lord, the Speaker, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We have indeed found the fragrance of the mention of al-Javad who hath succeeded in teaching the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Upon him be My glorification and My sweet-scented breeze and My fragrance which hath perfumed the world from My luminous robe. We have mentioned him and do mention him as a favor from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. His mention and praise have attained unto the honor of being heard in this Station which hath been named the Supreme Horizon in the Book of Names, and the Uttermost End in the Green Isle, and the Heaven of heavens by the Most Exalted Pen, and the Most Great Prison in the kingdom of creation. Verily his Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By My life! Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Though tribulations and sorrows may afflict him on earth, God will soon manifest what He desireth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. My Glory be upon him and upon those who hearken unto his word concerning the Cause of God, the True King, the Manifest.</p>
<p>We make mention of the Nightingale who hath arisen to remember Me and hath voiced My praise amongst My servants. We testify that he hath attained unto the recognition of the All-Merciful in this Day wherein faces have been darkened and feet have slipped. O thou who art mentioned before the Countenance! All things have been set aflame by the warbling of the Dove of the Cause in the kingdom of creation, yet the people are in heedlessness and behind a veil. The wine of idle fancy hath so intoxicated them that they have been kept back from the Lord of Names Who was promised unto them in all the Books, Scriptures, Psalms, and in every Tablet. They have taken that which perisheth and cast away that which would endure for them in the kingdom of their Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Nightingale! Sing in My Name upon the branches of the Lote-Trees of the world, that haply there may be drawn unto it the peoples who have turned away from the Most Great Ocean and have turned unto every ignorant reprobate. The Tongue of the Ancient of Days hath spoken that which made the rocks cry out and the mountains to melt, yet the people are in strange doubt. They behold the proof of God, yet deny it. Thus doth the Mother Book recount unto thee from His presence. Leave the mention of them that have turned away, then make mention on My behalf of My servants who have hastened unto the ocean of My loving-kindness, who have turned towards the kingdom of My grace, who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hands of My favors, and who have heard from thee My mention and My verses, that they may rejoice in My days. Verily thy Lord is the Bestower, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>It is submitted that some time ago, magnificent and exalted Tablets descended from the heaven of divine will specifically for Jinab-i-’Andalib and Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid J., upon them be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and likewise responses to petitions from those parts and other Tablets. However, until now they have not been sent due to wisdom. Thereafter, the command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Specifically regarding the mention of Jinab-i-N.S. and his two sons, upon them be Baha’u’llah’s glory, it was uttered from the blessed tongue. God willing, may all the friends ever be and continue to be honored with the mention of the Beloved of the worlds. I swear by the Beauty of the Friend that neither the dominion of command and creation nor the kingdom of the heavens and earth can compare with His mention. Soon God will reveal what was hidden in this Day and show them His grace, His sovereignty, His power, His might, and the station of His loved ones. Verily He is the Protector over all things. There is no God but Him, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Though mention of my glory befitteth you not, yet I follow my Lord and the Lord of the worlds, my God and the God of all peoples, and I say: Glory and praise and honor be upon you both and upon his eminence Javad who attained that which most of the servants were deprived of, and upon those who have attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>The special submission is that His Holiness the Most Great Branch and His Holiness the Most Mighty Branch - may my spirit and being be a sacrifice unto the dust of their most pure footsteps - conveyed wondrous mention and sublime glorification to that beloved one and Jinab-i-Akhavi and Jinab-i-Javad. Likewise all those circumambulating send expressions of sincerity, glorification and glory to those beloved ones.</p>
<p>The reply to the honored master Aqa Mirza Muhammad T., upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, has been written and will be sent in the next post.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>11 Rabi’u’th-Thani 1297</p>
<p>One most holy, most exalted Tablet specifically for Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Javad, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, was revealed from the heaven of grace and was sent, and likewise this servant wrote and sent a letter in reply to Jinab-i-Mulla ’Abdu’r-Razzaq, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory - may that beloved one deliver them.</p>
<p>Regarding the Most Great Festival, what that beloved one has written is correct, there is no doubt in it. The first day of Naw-Ruz is counted as thirty-two and the afternoon of the thirty-second day is the beginning of the Festival when the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, entered the Ridvan. And that the afternoon of the first day and the following day are counted as one day is because engagement [in work] is not permitted therein, and there is another wisdom in it, but in counting the twelve days they are counted as two days.</p>
<p>And regarding the Huququ’llah, its minimum amount is one unit, meaning if any person possesses nineteen mithqals of gold or items reaching this value, after deducting the year’s expenses, Huquq becomes applicable to it and its payment becomes obligatory.</p>
<p>As to the meaning of wisdom, it signifieth wisdom in dealing with people. The people of Baha must conduct themselves with the utmost wisdom. Thus should anyone disclose to weak souls at this time the law of fasting, which is among the most weighty of divine ordinances in the Book, he hath strayed from wisdom. In all matters must they proceed in this wise. Such divine ordinances as would cause no disturbance or commotion to implement at this time must be observed. The disclosure of matters that would cause people to be alarmed is assuredly not permissible in the eyes of the wise. What need is there for one who is fasting to make it known?</p>
<p>His honor Aqa Siyyid Javad - upon him be the glory of God - who formerly dwelt in the Land of ?aff, made certain inquiries from the Land of Kha, and a detailed response was sent. Among these was that in the Most Holy Book the shaving of the head had been forbidden, and now in these lands some of the companions had acted upon this law and had thereby become known to all. Was this action in conformity with wisdom or contrary to it? From the Source of Command this blessed word was revealed: whatsoever would cause commotion among the servants is not permitted at this time, until the Cause be made manifest.</p>
<p>=== END BH00077 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00078 ===</p>
<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise and glory befit the dwellers of eternity’s realm unto the Lord of Names, Whose most pure hem hath ever been and shall remain sanctified from the calumnies of the people of hatred. Whatsoever hath issued from the mouths of the deceivers hath never found and shall never find access to His court of glory. These faithless, ignorant people have failed to comprehend the station of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth” and speak according to their own desires and idle fancies. Sanctified is the remembrance of our Lord from their whisperings, their murmurings, their utterances, their supplications and their invocations. Exalted is His grandeur and supreme is His sovereignty. There is no God but Him.</p>
<p>The letter from that honored friend arrived, and its contents were the cause of joy, for the fragrances of love for the Lord of the Revelation wafted therefrom. After its reading, We repaired to the Most Holy Court and presented it before the countenance of the Lord of creation, where it attained the honor of His attention. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth while seated upon the Throne in a place named Junayni. Exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: “There is no Revelation but His Revelation.”</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger.</p>
<p>O Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names! Thy letter hath arrived and the servant present before the Throne presented it at a time when sorrows encompassed Me from all directions. Verily, the M followed the M in his tyranny and oppression, cast aside the Lord and followed one who hath no mention in the court of God’s glory, the Creator of heaven. He hath lost in his deeds and gone astray in his endeavors. Soon shall he find himself in abasement and loss. Hear thou the call from the direction of Akka - it calleth in the kingdom of creation and commandeth all to righteousness, piety, trustworthiness, religion, truthfulness and fidelity. Blessed is he who heareth and acteth upon that which he hath been commanded by God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed art thou and thy father who hath taken for himself a station beneath the shade of his Lord’s grace, the Mighty, the Bestower. We have mentioned him with verses whose fragrance shall never cease and which the happenings of the world cannot alter. To this God’s Book in this station doth testify. The Glory from Us be upon him and upon thee and upon those who have attained and have ascended through the light of recognition unto God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>Hear thou in the Persian tongue: Convey Our greetings to all the kinsmen on behalf of the Wronged One. The loved ones have ever been and shall ever be remembered. The spiritual youth, upon him be My glory and favor, hath ever been mentioned and is witnessed before the Throne. His letter arrived previously and an answer was revealed in a realm sanctified above words, but until now it hath not descended from the world of meaning to the world of utterance. Know ye with absolute certainty that the loved ones of God have never been and shall never be forgotten from His sight, and the glances of His grace have ever been and shall ever be directed towards them. We counsel the friends to wisdom and to such deeds as will cause the attraction of hearts and the turning of souls unto God. In the land of ’Ayn and Shin, there occurred at the hands of the oppressors that which transformed the world of joy into grief. Glory be to God! In such instances both supreme joy and profound sorrow are manifest - consider this, O ye who possess insight! Praise be to God that they were slain but slew not, they acted in accordance with divine counsels. They took patience as their helper in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist all to be ever mindful of His counsels and exhortations. That which occurred in the month of Muharram regarding the Manifestation of the Herald and the Great Announcement - none but the people of truth have been or are aware of it. Therefore, the expression of joy in those days becometh the cause of revolution and hatred and rancor among the people. Wisdom doth not sanction the manifestation of joy and delight in those days. O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! Take ye that which will attract the hearts of the servants and draw them nigh unto God, the Lord of creation. We make mention of all the loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the light of divine providence. O people of God! Resolution is needed. We hope that through your words of guidance the saplings of being may attain to maturity and development, and that all on earth may be nourished by their fruits and effects. The Cause of the Most Great Announcement is mighty. The princes and divines have turned away and the people follow them. The wise among the servants should hold fast to that which will purify existence from the disease of ignorance and folly. At all times, pure and holy deeds and radiant, pleasing character are the helpers and supporters of the Cause. Blessed are they who hold fast unto these! Ahmad, the son of him who found repose beneath the shade of his Lord’s grace, is remembered.</p>
<p>He Who remembereth the one who hath been mentioned under the shadow of his Lord’s loving-kindness. Letters have repeatedly arrived from him. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him in that which will cause his remembrance to be exalted amongst His creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Say: O people! The divine Books, both of the past and present, have testified to the blessedness of these days, for the Sun of Truth shineth resplendent before all faces, the light of utterance is radiant and brilliant, the stream of mercy floweth and circulateth, and the breezes of God are wafting. Were a soul to contemplate the bounty bestowed upon a single leaf of the tree, he would, throughout his life, unceasingly utter “Thou art the Merciful” and “Thou art the Bountiful.” The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon you, O people of Baha, and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every one constant and trustworthy.</p>
<p>The fragrant breezes of divine revelation have pervaded the realm of meaning and utterance, yet the heedless servants are ever occupied in preventing it. This is a practice that hath persisted from ancient times. In all the days of Manifestation, they have striven to extinguish the light of divine unity and quench the fire of the Sacred Tree. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn His servants with that which beseemeth His days. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of Muhammad-Quli, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise his righteous deed. Praise be to God, after his deed was presented, it was accepted, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed for him from the heaven of the divine Will and sent forth. God willing, he will attain unto it. Well is it with him for what he hath wrought in the path of God. Likewise, mention was made of the friends of Khusif, upon them be the glory of God, the King, the Mighty, the Kind, the Compassionate, and the other friends, upon them be the glory of God, which was accepted before the face of the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God. His word, exalted be His majesty and glory, is:</p>
<p>He is the Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O Muhammad! There hath come upon Us in the Most Great Prison that which hath caused the realities of existence to lament. The oppressor hath been consumed by the fire of greed and passion, and hath wrongfully devoured the property of the people. Verily, he is of the people of tyranny. He hath cast away godliness and seized upon passion, and hath committed that which hath caused tears to flow from eyes. We have heard thy call and have called thee from the Mount of Knowledge. God, there is none other God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Preserve the verses of thy Lord, then recite them in such wise that hearts are attracted thereby, then drink in My name from the cup of My utterance, My choice sealed wine. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the Lord of the invisible and the visible.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Mulla ’Ali, upon him be the everlasting glory of God. His word, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>He is the Most Exalted, the Most High</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Ali! The wolves of the earth have surrounded the sheep of God, and the beast of the world seeks to harm the loved ones of the Most Great Name. Tyrants from every direction have openly arisen in oppression, and pharaohs from every quarter are engaged in transgression. Yet in such circumstances the Tongue of Grandeur speaks in praise of His loved ones, for this handful of dust is as naught in the sight of God and His loved ones. By God’s life! The clanking chains of the world are but as the buzzing of a fly to the faithful, and its buildings and prosperity are as a spider’s web, nay less than that. Convey My greetings to the loved ones on behalf of this Wronged One. Soon these days shall come to an end. Strive that ye may attain to that which shall be accepted and adorned with everlasting glory. The Day is the Day of deeds. Fix your gaze upon trustworthiness and hold fast to righteousness. He verily counsels His servants and advises them with that which shall exalt them. He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Ali Kh. Upon him be the Glory of God. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great!</p>
<p>O Ali! Upon thee be My Glory! The oppressor of the world has opened the door of counsel. Say: O heedless one! It behooveth thee first to counsel thyself. By God’s life! Blood hath been shed, wealth hath been plundered, oppression hath been wrought, and that hath been committed which hath caused all things to lament, as well as the dwellers of Paradise and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. He hath been seized for his sin, yet he perceiveth it not. Soon shall he behold the recompense of his deeds from God, the Avenger, the Almighty. The transgressor hath followed the oppressor in his tyranny and hath written that which caused the companions to cry out and hath been consumed with the fire of hatred in such wise that the realities of being trembled and the tears of the righteous flowed. We beseech God to protect His servants from his evil. He verily is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One. He remembered thee with such remembrance as caused the very stones to soar. Glory be upon thee and upon those whom the oppression of the oppressors hath not deterred from turning unto God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in the letters Kha and Vav! Hear My call. It verily draws you nigh unto the supreme horizon and guides you to the Dayspring of guidance. Deprive not yourselves of the Dawning-Place of Revelation. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to that which ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of all directions. We have mentioned you before in numerous Tablets with such mention as hath illumined the horizons. It endeth here. His is the praise and the glory, His the thanks and the splendor. He hath remembered His loved ones with that which shall cause their names to endure throughout the duration of His most excellent names and exalted attributes. Our Lord is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>We beseech God that He may cause all to attain unto that which is the cause of the spreading of His signs among His servants. This spreading, as mentioned in the revealed Tablets, hath ever been and shall continue to be dependent upon goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, for deeds and character that are manifested in the path of God attract hearts and souls, and this attraction is the cause of drawing nigh, and drawing nigh is the cause of awareness and the station of propagation. God willing, may all attain thereunto.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the honored uncle, Mulla Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the bounty of our Most Glorious Lord. He, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His utterance, speaks:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who calleth from the Supreme Horizon […]</p>
<p>O Akbar! After ’Ali strange matters have appeared and peculiar signs have become manifest. The wolf counsels God’s sheep, saying “Drink not blood and rend not flesh”; the serpent admonishes the fish to be patient, and the bear the cock; and the embodiment of tyranny says to the embodiment of justice “Oppress not, seize not the people’s wealth, fear God.” Indeed the world has changed - wickedness and iniquity counsel righteousness and piety and command godliness. Such deception and craftiness have appeared in the world as have had and have no equal. One who would sell the realm of holiness for a penny claims to serve the world and love all peoples. By God! For a dinar he would deliver the righteous into the hands of the wicked and corrupt. He speaks of patriotism while secretly and openly shedding the blood of the sovereign. They are worshippers of money yet count themselves among the righteous. It behooveth us to leave mention of them and remember thee who hast turned to a Cause from which all in the land have turned away, save those whom the hands of divine power have delivered, God, the Lord of all mankind. We have mentioned thee before, and at this time with verses which, when revealed, caused the sun of knowledge to shine forth and illumined all lands. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: At a time when I am surrounded by enemies and serpents are visible on the right and left, I speak forth verses and make mention of you. Strive that ye may succeed in achieving that which is befitting and worthy on this day. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those whom God has related to thee, both men and women. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The days are mighty and great days. It would be a great pity should they pass in heedlessness. O friends of God and His loved ones! Striving is necessary that ye may succeed in accomplishing that which will endure in God’s Book. He is indeed the Generous, the Merciful, the Mighty, the Great. The relatives of that honored friend have repeatedly been mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur. Divine favors are beyond the reckoning of the servants. Were ye to count God’s favors ye would not be able to number them. But the people have heedlessly done that which no oppressor in any age has done. Their deeds bear witness to this before all faces. Soon shall they see their recompense from the presence of the Just, the Wise. Mention was made of the cousin, upon them both be the glory of God. After being submitted before the Holy Presence, these sublime and exalted verses were revealed. His blessed and exalted Word: He is the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Today all things are in a state of rapture, ecstasy and exultation through the manifestation of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, and they congratulate one another, uttering the words “how our eyes have been refreshed.” Blessed is the one who has recognized the station of these days and is occupied with the praise and glorification of the Desired One of all worlds. Today the world has another light, the sea another wave, and the Sadrat of Sinai another melody. Blessed is he that hath ears to hear and eyes to see, and woe unto the heedless! Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge, mine ears with the hearkening unto Thy call, and mine eyes with beholding Thy signs. I beseech Thee by Thy Kingdom and its mysteries, and by the heaven of Thy utterance and its stars, to ordain for me that which will exalt me amongst Thy servants and draw me nigh unto Thee, and to provide for me from the table of Thy heavenly grace. Verily, Thou art the Compassionate, the Generous. The glory of God rest upon thee, thy mother, thy brothers and thy sister, from God, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>After mention was made of his father, his wife, and the two servants named Ghulam-Husayn and Habibullah, upon them be the glory of God, and after their names were presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, these blessed verses were revealed from the heaven of grace - exalted be His majesty and abundant be His favors:</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of utterance of the Desired One of all worlds and hast drunk from the sealed wine. And thy kindred - thy mother, thy wife, and thy two sons - all have been mentioned before the Lord of Names. The remembrances of the world and what is with the peoples cannot compare with this remembrance, for the divine mention in the Tablet endureth as long as the kingdom and the realm endure, while all else returneth to nothingness. Convey My greetings to each one of them from the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Light of Providence. The loved ones have ever been and shall ever remain beneath the glance of grace, as attesteth He with Whom is the mighty Book.</p>
<p>And We make mention at this time of thy brother who was named Ali, that this remembrance may draw him to the highest horizon and the Hand of Bounty may give him to drink of the Kawthar of eternity. Blessed is he who hath attained to the outpourings of these days, and woe unto the heedless ones! O Ali, upon thee be My glory! Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided the thirsty one to the ocean of Thy mercy, the hungry one to the table of Thy heaven, the needy one to the sun of Thy generosity, and the sinful one to the heaven of Thy forgiveness. I beseech Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the Kawthar of bounty hath flowed from Thy Most Exalted Pen, to ordain for me that which will exalt me, preserve me, and benefit me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou knowest what is with me, and I know not what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! The Glory of God be upon you and upon your brother from Us. We give you both glad tidings of what hath been sent down unto you from the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have revealed unto him who hath drunk from the Kawthar of attainment and hath gained what was inscribed in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy - through which the sun of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful hath shone forth, the ocean of forgiveness hath surged, and the fragrance of the mercy of his Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful, hath wafted. Verily, they who have ascended in My days have attained unto that which none before them hath attained. This is attested by that which hath been sent down from the presence of the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our loved ones there. The Wronged One, in the midst of tribulations and sorrows, remembereth them with that which the treasures of the world cannot equal, that they may rejoice and be of the thankful. Convey My greetings unto them and remind them of that which hath been sent down unto them from the heaven of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous.</p>
<p>O loved ones of God in that land! The like of these days hath never been seen. This is the Day for deeds and steadfastness. All must be intent on reformation and associate with all the peoples of the world in the light of love, except him who hath turned away from this Most Great Announcement, the meeting with Whom had been the hope of those near unto God. Holding fast unto this cord, they must be detached from the world, must pass beyond the world of names, that they may attain unto a station which is sanctified from all similitude, peer, doubt, conjectures and vain imaginings of men. Know ye with clear certainty that whosoever in this Day attaineth unto but one word, he is mentioned in the Book of God as being of the Concourse on High.</p>
<p>O loved ones! Arise with zeal that perchance ye may, through wisdom and utterance, awaken the heedless souls and give them to drink of the Kawthar of steadfastness. The station of steadfastness is such that should all who are in heaven and on earth endeavor to prevent one from the straight path, they would find themselves utterly impotent. This is the most exalted station, the supreme pinnacle, and the crimson Tree. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world and taken hold of that which he hath been bidden by the One Who commandeth from ancient times.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn! O shoemaker! Reflect upon the grace and bounty of God. The shoemaker hath crossed the bridge while the learned have stumbled. Thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of knowledge and arrived, while the jurists remain bewildered in the wilderness of their fancies. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and the earth, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of the first and the last! Thou hast guided whom Thou didst will and who desired Thee, and hast forsaken those who sought other than Thee. I testify that Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Husayn! O farmer! Blessed art thou, for thou hast, through divine confirmation, rent asunder the veil of fancy and, through His grace, hast torn away the intervening veils. Beseech God to grant thee steadfastness, for the croakers lie in ambush and the doubtful ones wait in observation posts. Say: My God, my God! Increase the light of my knowledge, then preserve me through Thy power which hath encompassed all created things, lest my feet slip through the doubts of the skeptical ones and the croaking of the croakers who have broken Thy Covenant and desired to prevent Thy servants from the stream of Thy mercy and Thy manifest, clear, and evident path.</p>
<p>As to the matter of requesting visitation and circumambulation by proxy through this evanescent servant, on this day, which is the sixth of the month of Rabi’u’th-Thani, six hours past dawn, the visitation was performed on behalf of that spiritual friend and was honored with acceptance. Blessed am I and art thou, and blessed is he who hath attained unto this supreme bounty and mighty favor.</p>
<p>He Whose utterance is the Remembrance maketh mention of My beloved Haji Muhammad Kazim, upon him be 669 [Baha’u’llah], and likewise of the news concerning what transpired in the great city. Glory be to God! Greed and avarice have deprived those souls of the shore of trustworthiness, religion, justice and fairness. Would that it had ended with this matter! But no, by God! Each day they utter a new calumny and cling to fresh lies. One who was known for tyranny and wickedness, and who turned away from godliness in this land - out of care and protection they ordered him to leave. He went to the great city and united with one like himself, and they clung to such calumnies that the greatest terror became manifest from all things, and justice and fairness engaged in wailing and lamentation. This is the way of these people, and thou shalt never find any change in their ways. Haji Muhammad Karim Khan Kirmani wrote a book of refutation every year, and likewise some poets of the age have said that which their recompense is established and confirmed with the Just, the Wise One, and the punishment for this rebellion shall have no end and no conclusion. Similarly, Sipihr the historian wrote that from which the pen seeks refuge with the Truth. In any case, these matters have been and are inwardly the cause of the exaltation of the Word and the spread of the Cause. The servant beseecheth his Lord to adorn His servants with that which draweth them nigh unto Him and causeth them to speak with justice and fairness. Verily, He is our Protector and our Goal, and He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>The spiritual friend, Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, gave thy letters to this servant, and each was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. In truth, these letters became the cause of the manifestation of the greatest grace. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the cup of utterance of his Lord, the Most Merciful. The servant testifieth that he is among those who are nigh unto God in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. I convey greetings and glory to all the friends of that land, both small and great, female and male, and I have sought and do seek for each one an eternal reward and everlasting good. And I beseech Him, exalted be He, to preserve them through His bounty and give them to drink from the cup of steadfastness from the hands of His bestowal. Verily, He is the Generous, the Munificent.</p>
<p>The Branches of the Divine Lote-Tree - may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of their footsteps - make mention of that spiritual friend and his relatives and the aforementioned friends, upon them be the Glory of God, and they beseech God, exalted be His Glory, for each one an enduring blessing and heavenly sustenance. Verily, He is God, there is none other God but Him, the Manifestor of that which was hidden in knowledge and concealed from sight. Verily, He is the Helper, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Haji Mulla Baqir and Haji Rida and Aqa Muhammad Husayn and Aqa Ali, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented before the Presence, there was revealed for each one specifically that which giveth glad tidings of eternal life. Blessed are they who have attained.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Haji Mulla Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God - exalted be His utterance and sublime be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Baqir! Hear the call of the Wronged One. Verily He hath appeared with the truth and hath spoken before all faces. The Command is God’s, the Omnipotent, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. God’s proof hath been perfected unto His creation and His testimony unto His servants, yet most of the people perceive not. The Spring of Life hath welled forth before the faces of all religions, and the Euphrates of mercy hath flowed from the Pen of God, Lord of what was and what shall be. This is the Day wherein the light of utterance hath shone forth from the horizons of the heaven of the tablets of thy Lord, the Possessor of all being. Blessed is the eye that hath attained unto His traces, the ear that hath heard His sweetest call, and the hand that hath taken hold of His sealed Book. Aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, then open the doors of hearts through His Name, the Mighty, the Loving. Thus have We lit the lamp of utterance in the niche of the wisdom of God, the Lord of the visible and invisible. God hath heard thy call and revealed for thee that which cooleth the eyes. The splendor from Us be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto Our sealed wine.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Haji Rida, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name through which the fragrance of divine knowledge hath wafted through all possibility!</p>
<p>O Rida! Thy name hath been present before the Most Glorious Horizon. We have mentioned thee with that which hath diffused the fragrance of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all beings. Say: By God’s life! The ocean hath surged before all faces and the fragrance of God, the Lord of lords, hath wafted. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and found, and woe unto him who hath denied what hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s bounty, the Lord of the beginning and the end. When thou hast attained unto the reading of My verses and the witnessing of My signs, say: My God, my God! I testify that Thou hast manifested Thyself unto all who dwell in the realm of being, and the Euphrates of Thy mercy hath flowed amidst all religions. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy Most Great Throne and the mysteries of Thy Cause, O Lord of eternity, to make me detached from all else save Thee and to hold fast unto the mountain of Thy grace. O Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones among the oppressive ones among Thy servants, and Thy chosen ones among the deniers who have been enkindled with the fire of hatred in Thy days. I beseech Thee by Thy power which hath encompassed all created things to preserve them through Thy bounty and aid them through Thy power. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name through which the Herald hath called out between earth and heaven!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! This Wronged One, while in the hands of His enemies, hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee, that perchance thou mayest be ignited with the heat of God’s remembrance - an ignition which the doubts of the workers of iniquity and immorality cannot prevent thee from attaining the Most Exalted Horizon. All the people of the world were waiting and still wait, yet when the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the Mount of Sinai, all turned away save whom thy Lord willed. Praise the Desired One of the world Who confirmed thee in turning toward Him and mentioned thee with verses that shall endure in the Perspicuous Book. It behooveth thee to say in this station: Praise be unto Thee, O Desired One of all who are in the heavens and the earth!</p>
<p>This was revealed for Ali, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name through which the earth and heaven were illumined! […]</p>
<p>O Ali, upon thee be My glory! Today the cloud of divine mercy is, at every moment, bestowing that which causeth the growth of the ears of knowledge and inner meanings. The Sun of Thy Lord’s bounty shineth resplendent before the faces of His servants, yet the people remain heedless and veiled, save those whom the hand of the power of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, hath delivered. We beseech God to assist His loved ones to comprehend His infinite bestowals. By My life! Were the people of the earth to recognize but one word of His utterances and its effects in the realm of earth and heaven, they would all assuredly forsake whatsoever they possess and cling to that which is with God. Say: My God, my God! Deny me not the outpourings of Thy days, and deprive me not of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. I testify that Thou art the Most Generous, the Possessor of the Most Great Message.</p>
<p>The Luminary of bounty and generosity has dawned and shone forth with its rays upon His chosen ones, His sincere ones, and His loved ones. Blessed is he who is illumined by it, detached from all else - he is truly among the triumphant ones in God’s Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. In truth, divine favor and bounty have reached such a degree that the drop seeks the station of the ocean, and the atom the station of the sun. This evanescent servant ever submits: “My God, my God! Deprive not Thy servants of the Kawthar of steadfastness in Thy Cause, such that names withhold them not from their Possessor.”</p>
<p>At this point a story comes to mind which is worthy to be related: Some years ago, one named Siyyid Taqi attained the presence [of Baha’u’llah] and dwelt for a time in this land. After departing, he met on his way one Hussein known as Sukht� who asked him whence he came. He mentioned ’Akka. Hussein said “Why do you not go to Cyprus? Mirza Yahya is the successor of the Point.” With these words, all his ranks of steadfastness, faith and devotion were scattered to the winds. He thereafter went to Cyprus and returned to Iran with a book of falsehoods. Glory be to God! How can one claiming divine love be turned from the straight path of the Lord by a single word, when that person himself knew that the aforementioned Hussein had no knowledge of anything? Indeed it is the recompense of deeds that leads man into vain imaginings and deprives him of the light of certitude.</p>
<p>Today the people of Baha have passed beyond the gulf of names and set their course toward the ocean of inner meanings. They have placed the whole world beneath their feet and taken the final step to the Most Exalted Station. The Command is in the hand of God, our Lord, the Lord of earth and heaven. Also Nafsi from Jadhba went to Kirman some years ago and there was deprived by one fabricated word from the Mother Book. Would that he had stopped at that! He engaged in deception, falsification, lies and calumny. Through guile and deceit he obtained one of this servant’s letters that had been sent to one of the friends, intending to copy and send it to the opponents.</p>
<p>This servant submits: “My God, my God! Protect Thy servants from the evil of the opposers, the deniers and the barking ones, and aid them all to justice and fairness that they may behold Thy signs with their own eyes and hear Thy verses with their own ears. Verily Thou hast power over all things.”</p>
<p>Every movement of the Desired One of all worlds is a manifest proof and clear evidence, but prejudice has become a veil. One day the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these sublime words which melted the liver. His words, exalted be His utterance and mighty His dominion: “O servant in attendance! Would that the deniers of the Bayan had reflected this much: We would have established this Cause firmly among the people of Iran and raised it to the most exalted station and highest rank. At that time We would have entrusted it to whoever was worthy. Each day after countless hardships when the Cause was somewhat elevated, certain souls, out of pure hatred, committed that which caused the Cause of God to be wasted. In the days of tribulation all were hidden behind veils, but when the light shone forth and the Cause became manifest, they drew their swords.”</p>
<p>He Who is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth!</p>
<p>Thy name hath come before the Wronged One, Who hath made mention of thee in verses from which hath shone forth, from the horizon of each word thereof, the Sun of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. This is the Day whereon the Sun proclaimeth “Sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the All-Wise,” and wherein the Ocean proclaimeth “Greatness belongeth unto God, the Goal of them that have known Him.” Blessed is the servant who hath heard the call raised by all things in celebration of God, the Lord of all creation, and woe betide every heedless and remote soul. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to illumine thee with the light of recognition and to kindle thee with the fire of His love. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, and within His grasp lie the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When thine eyes are cheered by the traces of My Most Exalted Pen, say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having made mention of me, and caused me to hear and to see, and thanksgiving be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy manifest path and Thine evident, mighty, and unshakeable Cause. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity which hath encompassed all existence to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, that my footsteps slip not through the doubts of them that have turned away from Thy straight path. Thou, verily, hast power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He Who is manifest and standeth before kings and subjects alike!</p>
<p>A Book that speaketh the truth and summoneth mankind unto the supreme horizon, the station wherein the Call hath been raised and wherein hath appeared that which was recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Books of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. He Who was promised by the Tongue of Grandeur hath come, and He Who was inscribed by the Pen of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised, hath been made manifest. Blessed be the soul that hath heard and turned unto Him and attained His presence, and woe betide him that hath turned away from this manifest grace.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Hasan! We have heard thy call and make mention of thee with that which transcendeth all the remembrances of the people, that thou mayest aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance and be of those who are assured. Take thou the Kawthar of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, then drink it in His Name, the One Who ruleth over all names. Verily thy Lord is the Commander, the Counsellor, the All-Knowing. Beware lest the whisperings of the turbaned folk debar thee from the Most Great Ocean, and beware lest the intimations of the worshippers of names withhold thee from this resplendent and shining horizon. Say: O people! This is the Day of God, did ye but know it, and this is the Day which was promised in the Books of God, both of the past and of the future, did ye but recognize it. He Who was hidden in knowledge and promised by God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath come. Say: Fear God, O peoples of the earth! Cast away what ye possess and take hold of the tokens of God through His power, then recite them with the melodies of the Most Exalted Paradise. These shall guide you and bring you nigh unto His praiseworthy station. He who is assured of His power and His authority shall not be shaken by the doubts of men, nor by the signs of those who have denied the Promised Day. Say: My God, my God! Withhold me not from the Most Great Steadfastness in Thy Cause, O Lord of all being, and number me not with them who believed in Thy proof and then denied it by following the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Strengthen me, O my God, that I may rend asunder all veils through Thy Name, the Strong, the Mighty, the One Who ruleth over what hath been and what shall be. Thus hath the fragrance of revelation been diffused and creation been perfumed through the sweet-scented breezes of the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Be thankful and say: Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of Names, and unto Thee be glory, O Desire of hearts and minds. Then know thou that We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book, at the outset of Our arrival in the Most Great Prison, that which appeared in the land of Kaf and Ra, and We informed the people of what would transpire therein. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We beseech God to strengthen thee and make thee steadfast in His Cause in such wise that neither thou nor His loved ones shall be hindered by the whisperings of them that have turned away from the Truth. Verily He is the Powerful over what He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all affairs. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid thee in serving His Cause and in remembering Him amongst His servants. He, verily, is the Helper, the Forgiving, the All-Kindly. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and have said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom and of the realms above!”</p>
<p>It is hoped that the sweet savours of the divine verses may take possession of the world and make His loved ones mindful of the events that transpired among the previous party, that they may not be deprived of the Names through their Lord, and may not accept the insinuations of every infidel. May they arise to serve with clear certitude, that perchance the earth may be illumined by the light of divine wisdom. Verily our Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and worthy to answer prayer. Again do I make mention that each of the loved ones hath been and is remembered with heartfelt remembrances, and for all do I beg bounty from the ocean of bounty and perpetuity from the sun of perpetuity. Verily He is the Protector of those who do good and the Goal of them that seek. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon the loved ones and friends of God there and in all directions, and praise be unto Him Who is the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>4 Jamadiyu’l-Avval 1307</p>
<p>May what has been sent be directed to the Land of Jadhba and Ba and Shin and certain other places, for this would be well-pleasing. The two rugs which were previously sent have arrived and have been graciously accepted. According to the command, whatsoever is sent to those regions should reach the beloved of the heart, that spiritual youth, upon him be the glory of God and His grace and bounty and mercy. They should make copies and deliver to their owners. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and praise to that spiritual one, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and to the delight of eye and vision, Ahmad. Their mention hath ever been and still is in the Most Holy Court, especially at this time when the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken this exalted word: “O servant in attendance!” God willing, a reply shall be sent to that spiritual one, upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness, and likewise a reply to Ahmad, upon him be My glory. Blessed be they both and may they rejoice in what cometh to them from God, their Lord.</p>
<p>=== END BH00078 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00079 ===</p>
<p>Let the honored spirit of His Holiness Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon whom be all the Most Glorious Glory, observe with his luminous gaze.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His majesty, His greatness and His power!</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O thou who hast heard the call of Truth, turned to the Truth, responded to the Truth, and drunk the choice sealed wine from the hand of the bounty of Truth, when thou didst speak the Truth, and bear burdens in the path of Truth, and show patience in Truth, and attain the presence of Truth when it was made manifest in Truth, and believe in Truth when most of creation turned away from it. My spirit be a sacrifice unto your remembrance! The breezes of the springtime of His mercy wafted again and again, yet this withered sapling did not stir nor become fresh. The proof is that it did not achieve the honor of submitting a response, though multiple letters arrived from His presence. In truth, each one was a source of victories and cause for the spirit’s joy, yet since there was delay in responding, it became a source of regret and sorrow. This petition is outwardly presented and continues to be presented, but in reality all affairs are suspended by the cord of God’s will. In this case, this servant is content and His Holiness is grateful, and this station is peace for all and all are at peace.</p>
<p>A letter arrived in these days from His presence which was written in response to Ibn-i-Asdaq (upon them both be the Glory of God). I swear by the Beauty of the Desired One of the worlds that such a fragrance emanated from it that all senses derived pleasure and strength from it. And this response was given at a time when he had written “Write to this evanescent servant what is the cause of the delay in our petitions.” Although they too were distressed that no word had reached them from the Desired One, yet blessed art thou in what thy pen hath uttered! By the life of the Beloved, thou hast spoken pure truth in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>God willing, in these days the response to Ibn-i-Asdaq (upon them both be the Glory of God) and the response to his honor Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah (upon him be the Glory of God) and the response to the loved ones of the Land of Kha (upon them be the Glory of God) will descend from the heaven of grace and be sent. If all the world were to gather, they would not find a shore or boundary for this ocean of grace. No engineer has been or will be capable of measuring its width, length and depth. It is a surging, billowing sea that none has comprehended save God, the Single, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The blessed letter dated the 14th of Rajab was the cause of boundless joy. God willing, this bounty shall remain lasting and enduring.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about a letter arriving from his honor Haji Kazim - the letter was seen and its details were submitted to the Most Holy Court. He expressed His favor.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about his honor Amin from the people of the right hand, this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “O Amin! Thou hast seen in God what ought not to be seen, and heard in God what ought not to be heard. We thank God for having enabled thee to hear and see and bear burdens in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. All this hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Tablet, to which the Lord of creation in this exalted station doth testify. Soon shall that which is hidden from sight be revealed. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon thee and upon those who have believed in God in that place. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness in this Most Great Cause, and blessed is the house wherein the remembrance of the Lord of Eternity hath been raised, and blessed is every patient, grateful one.”</p>
<p>O Husayn! Your mention hath come before the Wronged One, and He maketh mention of thee that thou mayest rejoice and be among them that are steadfast in this Cause, through which every mountain hath been crushed, every camel hath moaned, every husband hath lamented, and every mighty edifice hath been shaken. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One - verily He calleth thee from the precincts of the Prison and commandeth thee with that which beseemeth the days of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. God willing, mayest thou be blessed through divine grace and be occupied with the mention of the Truth. The call of the Lord of Lords is raised at all times, while the buzzing of flies is evident. God willing, may all servants be assisted and, with a mighty arm, shatter the idols of vain imaginings and attain unto their ultimate goal. O Husayn, give thanks unto God, thy Lord, in all conditions, then make mention of Him among His heedless servants. In all circumstances be mindful of wisdom, lest any matter arise that would cause the clamor of the deniers.</p>
<p>We likewise make mention of ’Ali ibn Sultan and his brother Mahdi and Muhammad who is imprisoned and ’Ali, and wondrous and exalted verses have been revealed. God willing, may they attain unto them. O ’Ali! Praise God for having aided thee to turn unto Him and granted thee the grace of attainment in the days of thy Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded in the Book; this is better for thee and for those who have believed in God, the Lord of the final end. Hold fast unto that whereby the Cause of God is exalted. Thus doth the Lord of Names command thee from this Prison which God hath made the Dawning-place of His verses.</p>
<p>We make mention of Mahdi and counsel him with that which beseemeth man. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We make mention of him who hath believed in God and His signs and hath turned towards this Horizon from which the horizons have been illumined.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Rejoice in that the One, the Single, Who hath spoken and speaketh at all times “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the beginning and the end,” hath made mention of thee. Beware lest anything hold thee back in the path of God. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s grace and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Lords, for having made me to know Thee and aided me to recognize this Cause whereby feet have slipped.”</p>
<p>O ’Ali! He Who is imprisoned in God’s path, through that which the hands of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all mankind, have wrought, maketh mention of thee. Give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast mentioned me in the Most Great Prison, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of verses.”</p>
<p>It is requested that His Holiness write in response to Haji Kazem and give him glad-tidings that his letter was presented at the Most Holy Court, and exalted and wondrous verses were specifically revealed and sent for each of the names. God willing, may they not forget the divine counsels and act in accordance with what is befitting and proper, and remain occupied in the remembrance of God. Praise be to God, they have turned towards Him and attained His presence. I beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, that they may be aided to preserve what has been bestowed upon them. Convey greetings on my behalf to them as well. Mention was also made of Master Shahbaz in his letter. After it was presented, He spoke in Persian: “O Shahbaz! The True One spoke sweetly in Persian saying: ‘I came.’ Some denied outright, some hesitated, and others proclaimed these words: ‘Welcome, welcome, O Thou our Purpose, O Thou our Beloved!’ Then We tested both the hesitant ones and those who had accepted through another matter. A complete transformation was witnessed. Strive that thou mayest be mentioned among the people of the right hand in the Perspicuous Book. The evil ones lie in wait, and the Cause is most mighty. Glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds.” Regarding what you wrote about the sum that was bestowed and its distribution, this was presented. He said: “Excellent is what you have done in God’s Cause.” And specifically, mention was made from the Blessed Tongue of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Taqi, as he had acted with kindness regarding the sister of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Rida. Blessed be he and she.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Haji Kamaluddin, upon him be the Glory of God, mention was made of him and his family in the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of loving-kindness shone forth from the horizon of grace. They said: “O Zayn! Convey My glorification to the Kamal and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy which have preceded existence itself. Verily We have remembered him and those with him, and We shall continue to remember them as a token of My grace, for I am the Rememberer and the Remembered.” O Zayn! Although his gift did not reach the Most Holy Court and was not seen, it was accepted. Pure deeds are acceptable. His petitions submitted to the Most Holy Court, as well as his letters sent to this servant, were all heard. God willing, may they ever partake of and attain the outpourings of the All-Bountiful One. We beseech God to strengthen him in His commandments and prohibitions, and in all that befits the days of his Lord. We convey greetings to all the souls who have turned towards Him from among the people of Nur and Ra, and We counsel them regarding that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Soon will the voice of the croaker be raised - a matter about which We informed and warned the servants in Iraq, the Land of Mystery, and in the Prison. O concourse of divines! Should a croaker come to you with a book, cast them both behind your backs and put your trust in God, the Single, the All-Informed. By God’s life! It is assuredly the book of the wicked ones. This is what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an, saying: “Nay! The book of the wicked is indeed in Sijjin. And what will make you know what Sijjin is? It is a written record. Woe on that day to the deniers!” O Kamal! Give glad-tidings of divine favors to all the loved ones in the lands of Nun and Ra and the land of Kaf. All must remain steadfast in the Cause. In every age and dispensation when Satan led humanity astray, it was in the name of truth, for if falsehood were to appear as it truly is, no one would ever turn to it. It appears in the name of truth, making claims, and clinging to the utmost piety and godliness. Know this and be aware, and let not the autumn winds cause you to fall from the holy and lofty Tree. Hold fast unto it in the name of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. All must attain such heights - which today represent the station of supreme steadfastness - that they would consider the tales and utterances of the people of the world as mere stories, nay, as absolute nothingness. Thus does your Lord command you, O Kamal, and counsel the servants of God who have held fast to the Sure Handle and clung to the hem of God, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>The end. Further mention of this servant’s greetings and his complete effacement is dependent upon your grace. Likewise from Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, and his brother who attained in Zawra, both a petition and a letter addressed to this evanescent one were received. A Most Holy Tablet was revealed especially for them some time ago, but has not yet been sent. God willing, this servant hopes to find the opportunity to submit a response to them and to Aqa Kamal, upon him be the Glory of God. A letter also arrived these days from Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, which he had sent from the land of H and M, mentioning Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, as well as the philosophers, upon them be the Glory of God. God willing, a response will reach all, and all shall attain to that which God desires.</p>
<p>O Zein! We made mention of him before as a token of Our grace, and at this hour We mention him with a clear mention. And We make mention of him who was with him, that he may be of those who attain. He was set ablaze with the fire of love and attraction before thy Lord Who knoweth all things, and I am the All-Knowing. God willing, may they remain steadfast on the straight path of the Cause through the special favors of God, in such wise that should anyone bring all the books of the world, they would cast them behind their backs, standing firm in this mighty Cause. O Muhammad-i-Sadiq! Rejoice in that God hath forgiven thy mother and clothed her in the robe of forgiveness as a token of His grace. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Zein! We make mention of him who was martyred in My path when he drank the choice wine of My love and soared in Mine atmosphere and attained My presence, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. O Muhammad-i-’Ali! We make mention of thee on this night and bear witness that thou didst drink the Kawthar of martyrdom in the path of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have sent unto thee angels from Our presence to visit thee as a token of grace from God, the Lord of all worlds. And We make mention of all who are related to thee. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur in this mighty prison.</p>
<p>As for their request that mention be made of Karbila’i Muhammad-Husayn in the Most Holy Court, it was submitted, and He said: May he ever gaze toward the horizon of grace and act as befitteth. Verily he hath attained mention in the presence of his Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As for the request of some of the friends of God from the land of Ta that mention be made of them in the Most Holy Court, each was blessed with revealed verses, and the reply to the letters of Mulla ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, which he had written to this servant, was sent at the end of the month of Dhi’l-Qa’dih. And mention was made of the son of Jinab-i-’Ali-Nur, upon him be the Glory of God, who was named Hasan-i-’Ali. This is what the Tongue of the Desired One spoke concerning him: May he, God willing, drink of the Kawthar of contentment and the Tasnim of submission and be confirmed in that which is commanded in the Book. O Zein! Beseech God to protect His weak servants. In the Hidden Words this blessed passage was previously revealed: “O Sons of the Spirit! Ye shall be hindered from loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me.” Blessed is he and his father who was named with a wondrous name in the presence of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Give him these glad-tidings and convey to him the favor of the Wronged One.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write regarding Haji Khavar and the mention of Mulla ’Alijan, upon him be the Glory of God - a letter from Jinab-i-Ismu’llah Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, was written to this evanescent servant, and likewise a letter from Mulla ’Alijan himself. The reply to them and to some questions they had asked was written as commanded and sent. The Sun of favor hath risen upon them and the people of Mazandaran. On behalf of this servant, convey greetings to Haji Khavar. It would be advisable for him to go to Jinab-i-Ismu’llah Jamal, upon him be the Glory of God, that he might perhaps become the bearer of this servant’s letter and the divine Tablets. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the way.</p>
<p>As regards what you had written concerning Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God, who had returned from the land of N and R to the land of H and M - glory be to God! Several times was mention made of him in your letter; in various instances was he mentioned with the praise of the Beloved of the worlds, and this evanescent servant mentioned him in this petition - once in relation to Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, and likewise before and after in numerous places. This is naught but due to his steadfastness and arising to serve. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may enable all to attain unto that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>As for the request that mention be made in the Most Holy Presence of Aqa Muhammad-Hasan, Aqa Muhammad-’Ali, Haji Muhammad-Ibrahim and Aqa Siyyid Ahmad, this was submitted, and this is what shone forth from the horizon of grace: “O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of My loved ones in the land of H and M, and acquaint them with that which the Tongue of Grace hath uttered in this noble station. Blessed are ye for having turned towards Him, hearkened and responded to your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We enjoin upon you what is right and counsel you to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding have been sorely stirred. We send Our greetings unto you from this station, that ye may give thanks unto your Lord, the One, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the funds of the land of Y and T and others, what transpired in this regard is that after the reply of T was sent to that land, they wrote to this servant from the lands of T and Q and T giving details about that land, and there were certain mentions in those letters. After these were submitted to the Most Holy Presence, He said that since the reply of T had been graciously sent, there was no need to make further mention of such matters. In response to these words, that which was revealed from the Source of Command was sent.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Mosul, He said it would have been better had they paid attention to the glad-tidings and “give thou good tidings to the patient ones” after the blessed words “We shall surely test you.” Although drought hath encompassed most lands this year, yet the spreading of such matters by the friends may become the cause of certain incidents. The mention and spreading of such matters should in all cases occur with permission. Verily He knoweth His servants better than they know themselves. He, verily, is the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Later, when your letter arrived and the details you had written to Jinab-i-Aqa ’Abdu’l-Husayn were noted, copies thereof were sent to certain places as commanded.</p>
<p>And concerning what you mentioned in your second letter dated the 21st of Sha’ban about Jinab-i-Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God - in these days a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to him together with Mulla Muhammad-’Ali-i-Dahaji. The glances of grace have ever been and continue to be directed towards him. God willing, may he continue to be assisted in making mention of God and offering praise unto Him. God the One is witness that he hath never been absent from this evanescent one’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote asking whether the wearing of rings as revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas is specific to adults or includes minors as well, He said it is specific to adults, and likewise the Prayer for the Dead - that too is specific to adults.</p>
<p>As to what you had written regarding whether it is permissible for a person outside the City of ’Akka to fast or not, and whether vows and pledges to fast are binding or not - these matters were submitted to the Most Holy Presence. He said that the law of fasting remains as it was revealed, but if someone makes a vow to fast for God’s sake to fulfill needs or otherwise, there is and has been no objection. However, God, exalted be His glory, has preferred that vows and pledges be made for matters that benefit the servants of God.</p>
<p>And then the third star shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of your favors. When the servant was illumined by its light and radiance, he presented himself before the Throne and submitted its contents. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur in the Kingdom of Utterance: “O Zayn! Thou hast been and art remembered before the Throne, and mention of everyone in thy letter hath attained to the mention of God. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. God willing, be thou occupied with promoting the Cause in the nights and days. Thou must manifest the utmost joy, for thou hast attained unto the word of contentment. We praise thee and say: ‘Praise be to Him Who speaketh.’”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the distribution of funds after the telegraphic news - this was accepted, and it should also reach those souls who left ?adba (Mosul) whose names you had mentioned in this letter.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God, who had written to you asking that his matter be submitted to the Most Holy Presence - it was submitted. The Sun of favor rose from the Dayspring of grace and these exalted words descended from the Source of verses. He, exalted be His grandeur, says: “O Zayn! We have heard the call of Varqa and mentioned him before, and before before, and after, and at this moment when the Tongue of Grandeur speaks: ‘The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.’ Blessed is he for having arisen to serve his Lord and for reminding people of what they were commanded by the All-Informed Commander. A letter came from him containing the names of those who drank the wine of life in the name of the All-Merciful, and We mentioned each one of them with a mention that shall endure as long as names endure in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds. Give him the glad tidings of My mention, My favor, My mercy, and My grace, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful. Blessed is his father who attained unto that which cannot be mentioned in words. The Pen of the All-Merciful beareth witness to this in this noble station.”</p>
<p>And regarding your mention of Aqa Asadu’llah, this is what was revealed for him: “O Asad! Praise the Lord of the unseen and the seen Who enabled thee to recognize this Most Great Cause, from which most nations remain veiled and heedless. Blessed art thou for having turned towards and believed in Him from Whom the servants have turned away. God willing, through divine favor thou must preserve this lofty station, for the evil ones with utmost cunning and schemes lie in wait for receptive souls. Thou wast mentioned in the book of one who loved Me; I mentioned thee as a favor from Me. Therefore praise God, thy Lord, for this manifest favor. The Glory be upon thee and upon him who was named Nasru’llah and Muhammad-Husayn and upon those who have believed in the One, the All-Informed. We counsel all to the most great steadfastness and to that which God hath revealed in the Book.”</p>
<p>With regard to Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib, upon him be the Glory of God, concerning what you wrote, this was submitted, and this is what the Tongue of the Desired One spoke: “O Talib! We have remembered thee, strengthened thee, assisted thee, and forgiven thee as a bounty from Our presence and a mercy from Our court. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I have turned with my whole being unto Thee and have written upon myself to make my will subservient to Thy will and good-pleasure. I beseech Thee to ordain for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>In these days this servant wrote a letter in response to his missive and sent it, and that letter was adorned with divine favors and verses. God willing, they will attain unto it.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, brother of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq the emigrant, upon them both be the Glory of God, this was submitted. He said: “Give him the glad tidings of his Lord’s mercy and his Master’s grace. God hath forgiven him, and We counsel him to show forth the greatest steadfastness in this Cause whereby the limbs of all names have trembled.” God willing, may they gaze at all times toward the horizon of the All-Merciful, remain firm in His Cause, and act according to what hath been revealed in the Book. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon him and upon his brother Muhammad-Sadiq who emigrated in the path of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, he is among those who loved God in the earliest days. Blessed is he, and unto him be grace from the presence of One Forgiving, Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Makhdum-zadih, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise Abdullah and Muhammad-’Ali from the people of N and J, after submission these verses were revealed from the Kingdom of Grace:</p>
<p>He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great!</p>
<p>O Rida! We have heard mention of thee from a letter sent by Zayn who hath attained the grace of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, and We have mentioned thee in truth that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones in that place who have drunk the wine of steadfastness in this firm and irrevocable Cause. Say: Should a crier come to you with a book, cast them both behind you, turning instead to the Mighty, the Loving; and should anyone come to you with news from Satan who crieth out in the name of the All-Merciful, leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>O friends! Hear ye in the Persian tongue the utterance of the All-Merciful. Verily He remembereth you, and acquainteth you, and teacheth you as a token of His grace, and He is the Ancient Bestower. The Book of the wicked hath appeared–the Book whose mention was made in former scriptures and divine Tablets. Ye must at all times be mindful lest the promptings of Satan debar you from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. With the utmost deceit and guile do they appear, clinging to the cord of falsehood. Though in truth those who have drunk from the Most Great Ocean will not turn to a mere rivulet, and are so steadfast that the entire world cannot deter them. Blessed are they and happy are they! They are they whom God hath mentioned in His Books, His Scrolls, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Through them hath the horizon of steadfastness been illumined, and the Dove hath warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Oneness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O friends! Drink ye from the chalice of certitude in the name of the All-Merciful. Ye are forever remembered in the presence of God. Know ye the worth of this supreme bounty and recognize the station of this blessed Day. By the life of God! The sun hath never risen upon its like or semblance. With utmost love, harmony and unity, arise for the Cause of the Lord of creation. Where are they who worshipped idols and cast aside the All-Merciful? And where are they who built palaces and gardens yet turned away from God, the Lord of the worlds? All that is witnessed today shall ere long return to nothingness and naught shall remain for anyone save that which hath been revealed by the Supreme Pen concerning him and recorded in God’s Book. Hold fast unto the Book of God, then act according to that which hath been sent down therein from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed.</p>
<p>Through the Supreme Grace, all the people of that land have been blessed with divine favors and their mention hath appeared from the Supreme Pen. How beloved it would be if the friends of God in that land would consider these exalted words in every city, nay in every week, nay rather every day, and recite them.</p>
<p>Concerning the question about this blessed verse–His words, exalted be His grandeur: “Recite ye the verses of God morning and evening”–the intention hath been and shall be all that hath been revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance. This is what the Desired One hath decreed. O Zein! The greatest condition is the inclination and love of holy souls for the recitation of verses. If one verse, or even one word, be recited with spirit and joy, it is better than reading numerous books.</p>
<p>The fourth star hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of your favors. When I received it, I presented it before His presence. He, exalted be His grandeur, said: O servant present! That which hath been sent from the Kingdom of Divine Revelation to Jinab-i-Zein, upon him be My glory, hath nearly equaled that which was sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will upon the Messengers. He must praise God and thank Him throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the heavenly Dominion.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Javad of Nur, it was submitted, and this is what God revealed in response: “He attained the mention of God and His presence while in Baghdad. We heard his mention and his call, and the call of his brother, time and again, and We answered them and those who believed, in such wise that their names shall endure through the endurance of My Most Beautiful Names. Verily their Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Remembering, the All-Wise. Give them the glad-tidings of My favor, time and again. By My life, O Zayn, the rain of thy Lord’s mercy hath poured forth from the heaven of grace in such measure that those who count are powerless to reckon it. Blessed is he who hath attained unto these days and found their fragrance and arose to serve Him Who hath appeared therein, Who speaketh at all times: ‘The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all worlds.’ We, from this station, send Our greetings upon them both and upon the faces of My loved ones there, and We counsel them to be steadfast in this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq of Hamadan having written that Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-’Ali requests not to be forgotten when petitions are being made - when this was submitted, He smiled and said: “We have mentioned them both, and all the companions of that land have been honored with the mention of the Lord of the Throne. It is for Us to mention them and guide them and ordain for them what befitteth the favor of their Lord and the grace of their Master, and it is for them to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby every idol hath wailed, every false god hath cried out, and every discerning believer hath attained.”</p>
<p>We praise God that the fifth star hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of the heaven of your bounties. When I attained unto it, I turned my face to the face of the Beloved and submitted its contents before the Throne. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, and exalted be His glory: “Blessed art thou for having entrusted thy affairs to God and relied upon Him in all matters. We have heard thy call and the yearning of thy heart in the love of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Blessed art thou for having heard and responded and remained faithful to God’s Covenant, the King of Kings. All this is from His grace upon thee. Verily He caused thee to hear and drew thee nigh and enabled thee to witness and know and aided thee and assisted thee in this blessed and ordained Cause.”</p>
<p>This evanescent one submits that the fifth letter, which was the last of your letters dated the fourth night of Shawwal, arrived and brought comfort and bestowed bounty, brought fruits of meaning and removed the weariness of existence, for it was blessed with two bounties: one was your mention, and the other the portrait of the blessed Person of the Name of God “H” - upon him be all the most glorious glory and all the most resplendent light. Would that I had been with him and attained what he attained! In truth, this regret has not left my heart and never will, and to make up for it is most difficult. We shall see what God, exalted and mighty be He, willeth and ordaineth. Verily He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the letters, praise be to God, the missives from Ibn-i-Ism’ullah’ul-Asdaq and Mirza Asadu’llah, upon them be the glory of God, arrived. Their letters from the land of Kha have also arrived. Praise be to God, they are successful in praising the Truth, mentioning the Truth, and serving the Truth. I beseech the Most High to assist them in that which will exalt His Cause among His servants and protect them from the evil of His enemies who have cast the Book behind their backs and taken vain imaginings as lords besides God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, in these days the responses to their letters and petitions which have been submitted to the Most Holy Court will be sent. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Bestower, the Answerer.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the glory of God, mentioning the matter of Aqa Mirza Ayyub and Hakim Aqajan, upon them be the glory of God, and the occurrence of a wondrous event, and the request that it be submitted to the Most Holy Court - it was submitted. He smiled and mentioned them all in words that this servant is unable to retain and convey. Then He said: “Blessed are they, for they have done in the path of God what they were commanded in a Book that proclaims throughout the world that there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of them in this station that they may rejoice in the favors of their Lord, the Generous. O My loved ones in that land! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, Who hath borne in God’s path what no one among His servants hath borne. He hath turned unto you and speaketh unto you that which was raised up on the Mount from the Tree: ‘Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Letter of Ba, rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen time and again, then thank thy Lord, the Lord of the Final End. And We make mention of Ayyub who traversed land and sea until he entered the prison and attained the presence of God, the Lord of Lords. O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Aqajan, who hath done in God’s path that which caused the Lord of Eternity to rejoice in the most exalted station. We give glad tidings to all of God’s grace and His mercy that hath preceded all existence. O concourse of the wise ones in that land! By the life of God, ye have attained unto that which nothing in creation can equal, as doth testify He Who is the Lord of Names. He is verily the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We counsel you to remain steadfast in the Greater Steadfastness. The world shall pass away, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the One, the Chosen.’”</p>
<p>It is submitted that some time ago a letter arrived from Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, and he had made mention of the friends of God, especially mentioning Aqa Yehuda and his young child. It was submitted to the Most Holy Court. Limitless favors were shown toward them. We beseech the Truth to assist all to achieve that which He loves and is pleased with. And these wondrous and exalted verses were specifically revealed for the son. His word, exalted be His grandeur: “O young in years, O great in station! Thou hast attained in thy youth to a station wherein the Lord of all beings maketh mention of thee. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who hath heard thy prayers, and blessed is thy father who hath attained unto the recognition of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.” Say […]</p>
<p>O my Lord, my Master, my God and my Creator! I beseech the ocean of Thy bounty to water this tender plant in the garden of Thy love with the living waters of immortality, and protect it from the autumn winds. Thou art the Powerful, Thou art the All-Knowing. O my God, I have turned to Thee, I make mention of Thee, and through the blessing of Thy Name I am detached from all else but Thee. O God, we gaze toward Thee and seek from Thee. Manifest through us that which is worthy of Thee and Thy days. Thou art the Bestower, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>God willing, may all be illumined and radiant from the Sun of favor that hath dawned from the horizon of grace. O beloved of my heart! Reflect upon the favors of the Beloved of the worlds. This servant beseecheth his Lord to enable all to recognize that from which they have been debarred and to aid them to recognize the Dawning-Place of His verses and the Source of His inspiration.</p>
<p>The mention of the honored guest, upon her be the Glory of God, was in that holy missive and was presented before the Throne. He said: “God willing, may she abide beneath the shade of the One Friend, make mention of the One Friend, and be engaged in service to the One Friend.” And the dwellers of the pavilion of sanctity and grandeur showed loving-kindness toward her.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of the sister of Aqa Muhammad-Rida along with her verses. He said: “My mercy precedeth My wrath. She is among the handmaidens who was made captive in God’s path and afflicted with the hardship of exile. With these two bounties she was and will be deserving of generosity and munificence. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! We make mention of Our loved ones in that land who have cast away idle fancies and taken hold of that which they were commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance of them and remind them of what hath been sent down from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. We counsel them to act with rectitude and command them to that whereby the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, may be exalted. O My loved ones! Preserve your stations through My Name, the Powerful, the Mighty. The call of the All-Merciful hath been raised, and behind it is the cry of Satan. Shun it and be of those who are steadfast. Blessed is he who hath attained to the knowledge of God and steadfastness in His Cause. He is among the most exalted of creation in the Preserved Tablet. Thus have We adorned the horizon of the world with the sun of knowledge and the Most Great Ocean with the Ark of the utterance of your Lord, the Strong, the Trustworthy. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon My loved ones who are not deterred in God’s path by the blame of the blamers. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Zayn! We bear witness that thou hast fulfilled thy covenant and hast mentioned in every one of thy letters Our Most Truthful Servant who hath attained to pure servitude unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The hope of this evanescent servant is that you will remember each one of the respected gentlemen and friends of Truth who are in that land with the remembrance of this evanescent one’s nothingness and annihilation, and likewise the steadfast women who are there, including the honored guest and others, upon her and upon them be 95 [Baha’u’llah]. God willing, may all be mindful and remembered. The Glory of God be upon your honor and upon those with you, female and male, young and old.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>16th of Dhi’l-Hijjih 1297</p>
<p>=== END BH00079 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00080 ===</p>
<p>Praised be the Omnipotent Lord Who hath adorned the ranks of might with the points of the Supreme Pen, Who hath combined letters and words in a new and wondrous manner, Who hath raised therefrom the banner of “Verily He is God,” and Who hath manifested supreme power before the hosts of enemies with but a limited few. His helper in the first instance was the Supreme Pen and in the latter instance the manifestations of righteousness. Glorified be His utterance and exalted His dominion! Glory and praise be unto the hidden treasuries in the realm of creation, from which appeared the ranks of wisdom bearing the standards of utterance - such souls as were not overtaken by the intoxication of passion but rather by the joy of guidance. They stood before all faces and summoned all to the decreed Command of God, to the sealed wine. Blessed are they who have attained, and woe unto them who have denied and disbelieved - these are the companions of the fire in the sight of God, the Mighty, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>O thou beloved of my heart! The traces of the pen of love and affection have appeared in the form of the fruits of the Tree of Faithfulness. The leaves of the Tree warble with wondrous and enchanting melodies, and its fruits speak in praise of the traces of the Supreme Pen. After hearing, hearkening, becoming enraptured and filled with joy, it sought the station of the Lord of all beings. And after attaining the presence of Him Who conversed upon Sinai - may the spirit of all in the kingdom of command and creation be a sacrifice unto Him - He said: “What is in thy hand?” After its presentation He commanded me to read. I presented and read before His Countenance. When it was completed and ended, the Divine Lote-Tree spoke forth with its supreme verses, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Sorrowing One in the realm of creation […]</p>
<p>O thou who speaketh My mention and standeth in service to My Cause and gazeth toward My horizon! Hear My call which hath been raised from a station encompassed by the sorrows of the world, through that which the hands of those who claimed nearness and love for Me have wrought, committing that which hath caused the Pen of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, to lament. A door was opened in the great city to be the dawning-place of trustworthiness, chastity, faithfulness, religiosity, truthfulness and purity, but the oppressor made it a place of theft, treachery, tyranny and cruelty. By this did the near ones cry out and the sincere ones lament, then those who circled round the Most Great Throne and bore witness to that which God did testify that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Compelling over what was and what shall be. O Dove! Baha lamenteth and uttereth that which hath befallen the Temple of Trustworthiness - a blow, and upon the face of Truth - a slap, from him who with fingers of tyranny rent asunder the veil of sanctity and committed that which caused the greatest terror to appear in the City of God’s justice, the Lord of existence. We desired good for him, yet he desired evil for Us. Thereby was opened the door of derision and mockery against God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. The Wronged One calleth and summoneth all to harmony and unity, but those who broke the Covenant arose in such hypocrisy as caused all things to cry out from every horizon, yet most of the people hear not. The market of falsehood hath flourished through his deeds while truth languisheth in such grief as none knoweth save the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. By My life! He cast aside piety and embraced lewdness after We had forbidden him and Our loved ones from it in various tablets, to which faithful servants bear witness. We desired for him commerce, but the heedless one desired for Us loss. Say: Take what is good and abandon evil, a command from God, the Lord of Hosts. The profit of the Wronged One is justice and equity, not the ornaments by which the door of greed and passion was opened before the faces of men. Say: Beware, O people, follow God’s justice amongst you and follow not vain imaginings and idle fancies. O Dove! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Lord of all beings. There occurred in the great city that which burned the liver of justice. One who was shown the utmost kindness had the fire of greed and avarice so enkindled in his heart that he forgot God, exalted be His glory, and His bounty and favor. In nights and days he associated and was intimate with the enemy of God, committing that which caused hearts and minds to lament. Know, O Dove, that the Beloved is in manifest adversity, in manifest sorrow, in manifest grief, yet in all conditions praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus ends the fragrances of the utterance of the Goal of all worlds. From this the condition of this servant is known. Some time ago that Beloved One mentioned a person who had sent a letter from the great city to that direction. That heedless one went to the believer, the believer to the denier, the denier to the infidel. The fire of hypocrisy was enkindled in his heart and he united with another in acquiring ornaments and betrayal. Much of people’s wealth was lost, and now hypocrisy is manifest since his treacheries were not and are not confirmed. And rebellion hath reached such a point that although God, exalted be His glory, hath commanded association with the followers of all religions, He hath forbidden His loved ones from associating with him and the hypocrites. I beseech God to calm the fire of greed with the waters of contentment.</p>
<p>O My friends in the letter Ta and its environs! Hear ye the call of the Wronged One through Whom the realm of utterance and the realm of ears were created, whereof this Most Great and Perspicuous Book beareth witness. This is the call the hearkening to which hath been the ultimate desire of them that are nigh unto God and the sincere ones. He Who was enkindled with the fire of My love and who speaketh in praise of My beauteous praise hath made mention of you. We make mention of you through verses that attract the hearts of the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the pavilion of glory and the tabernacle of God’s protection, the Lord of all worlds. Verily We give them glad tidings of My grace and remind them of My verses, for I am the All-Merciful, the Generous. We have inscribed their names by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet which none hath discovered save God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. Blessed are ye for having taken the Kawthar of My utterance from the hand of My bounty and having drunk thereof in the name of God, the King, the True, the Just, the Manifest.</p>
<p>O Dove! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy. Say: A single drop thereof cannot be compared to all the seas of the world. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and woe unto the heedless. The helpless servants have been prevented by the divines of Persia from recognizing the Purpose of the worlds on the Day of His Manifestation. They are the most great veil unto themselves and unto the peoples, having deprived both. Give glad tidings unto My friends, for each hath attained unto that which hath no peer or likeness. At this moment the Kaaba of God hath turned toward them and the Manifestation of God gazeth upon those regions. We beseech God to make them treasuries of His love and repositories of His steadfastness and dawning-places of His bounty amongst His servants and His light in His lands. Verily He is powerful over all things. Soon shall We open the gates of utterance to make mention of them and praise them, and We shall strengthen the hearts in their turning unto them. Verily their Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Hearer, the Beholder, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. Glory be from Us upon them and upon those whom neither clamor prevented from turning to the Most Sublime Horizon nor were they frightened by the hosts of them who disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Our Lord, our Master and our Protector! We thank Thee for the wonders of Thy grace and praise Thee for the manifestations of Thy favors, Thy gifts and Thy bestowals. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Master of nations, to protect those who have turned toward Thee from the evil of the deniers, and those who acknowledge Thee from the oppression of them that deny Thee, and those who are nigh unto Thee from the tyranny of such as have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs on this Thy holy, mighty and luminous Day.</p>
<p>It is hoped that ere long there shall appear in that land and its environs that which shall guide all unto the straight path and the mighty announcement. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the receptivity and acceptance of Agha Siyyid Mihdi - upon him be the Glory of God, who has attained the sealed wine on this blessed and destined Day - after it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, a most wondrous Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of all beings specifically for him and was sent. God willing, may he drink from the wine of utterance that lies hidden and concealed within the words of the Lord of Religions, and through wisdom and utterance make the heedless servants aware, that they might not remain deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord in these days. He is indeed the All-Generous, the Munificent.</p>
<p>They mentioned Haji ’Ali-’Askar - upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, they have attained that which was the hope of the sincere ones. And specifically for the friends of Milan - upon them be the Glory of God - an exalted Tablet was sent. God willing, it will have arrived by now and eyes will have been illumined by its light. Repeatedly from the Tongue of Grandeur mention has been made of the emigrants and those who have attained from the land of Milan, especially those souls who are related to the honored beloved, His Holiness Haji A. and ?. - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. All are mentioned and have attained the glory of God’s favor. Blessed are they who have drunk the wine of His love and have turned to His horizon. The servant begs his Lord to protect them and assist them in what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>In these days, letters have repeatedly arrived from their children who are in T. and F., and mention of them has been made before the Face. A hundred thousand thanks that He has confirmed and granted success and caused His loved ones to attain that for which no likeness or similitude has been mentioned in any books, scriptures or psalms. He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous, the Forgiving, the Munificent.</p>
<p>And concerning the mention made of the handmaiden of God, the wife of Haji ‘Ali-’Askar - upon them both be the Glory of God - and likewise concerning her turning and presence, after presentation before the Seat of the Lord, this most exalted Word was revealed from the Source of the Command of the Lord of all men. His blessed and exalted Word: “O Dove! Upon thee be My Glory! Convey to the handmaiden of God the greetings of the Wronged One, and give her glad tidings, for her intention is manifest and clear before the Luminary of divine will, and the Tongue of Grandeur speaks this most exalted Word: ’O My handmaiden! Upon thee be My Glory!’ We beseech God - glorified be His majesty - to assist thee and to adorn with deeds thine intention which is now in the realm of words, and to accept what thou hast sought, and to ordain for thee the reward of those handmaidens who have intended the Most Great Goal and have attained to presence, hearing and witnessing. Give thanks to thy Lord for this bounty which has encompassed the world, then praise thy Master for this mercy which has preceded all peoples. Say! Say!:</p>
<p>‘Praise be to Thee for having guided me and made me recognize Thee and ordained for me the reward of those who have drunk the wine of nearness to Thee and have attained the lights of the Luminary of Thy presence. O my Lord! Thou art the Generous, there is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful. I beseech Thee to ordain for me in every world of Thy worlds all the good Thou hast ordained for Thy devoted handmaidens. Thou art indeed the Almighty, the Powerful, the Great.’”</p>
<p>Blessed is the soul that has attained or will attain to such a station, for through His grace and mercy the world has reached from seeking to the Desired One and has come from the station of asking to the station of attainment. If ye should count His favors ye could not reckon them. This servant too beseeches for that noble lady that which is the cause of prosperity and success. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>In My Name, sanctified above all names!</p>
<p>O Allah-Virdi, blessed art thou and blessed is thy name, for it denoteth and attesteth to the oceans of grace, bounty, bestowal and favor of the Lord of all beings. Praise the Ancient Beauty Who confirmed thee in His grace and favor, His nearness and knowledge. Say: My God, my God! I testify that Thou didst create existence through a drop from the ocean of Thy generosity, and didst manifest therefrom, through the rain of Thy mercy, whatsoever Thou didst desire through Thy power and grace. O Generous One! Thou art He Who was not hindered by the veils of the world from Thy purpose, nor were the clouds of the peoples an obstacle. With the finger of might Thou didst rend asunder the veils and guided Thy loved ones to the tabernacle of glory. The door of generosity was opened before the faces of the peoples and the path of salvation appeared before the eyes of the world. O Generous One! Deprive not hearts and souls from the breezes of Thy revelation, and forbid not eyes and ears from beholding and hearing. Thou art that Omnipotent One Who, with two letters, bestowed the ornament of existence upon absolute nothingness, and invited utter evanescence to the realm of eternity. O Merciful One! Grant this evanescent servant a portion from the Kawthar of immortality, and bestow from the ocean of knowledge that which befitteth Thy bounty. Thou art the Bestower, the Kind, and within Thy grasp is the reins of all who are in the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>And mention was made of Haji Muhammad-’Ali (of Maraghih). After it was presented before the Most Holy Court, these blessed words were revealed from the Mother Book. He saith, exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors: O thou who hast arisen to serve Me and who speaketh in My praise! Give him the glad-tidings of My grace and mercy. Verily We have mentioned him before and after, and aided him to turn unto Me, and gave him to drink of the Kawthar of My knowledge from the hand of My bounty, and I am the Generous, the Bountiful. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make him a letter of the letters of His Book and a banner of His name amongst His creation. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of Ibn-i-Dakhil who was intoxicated by the wine of My utterance and was drawn to My horizon and was moved to offer beautiful praise of Me among My servants who have drunk the Kawthar of knowledge from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The loved ones have ever been and continue to be remembered. Grace hath encompassed all and the means of divine confirmation have been vouchsafed, so that sanctified hearts might be illumined with the light of knowledge and enkindled with the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree–an enkindlement which, it is hoped, may set the world ablaze. This servant conveyeth to each one greetings and salutations, and beseecheth from God that which is the cause of life for all. O Beloved of my heart! I swear by the Sun of Truth that were people to become aware of His grace and bounty even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would find themselves detached and freed from aught else but Him. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine and attained that which the near ones and the sincere ones have attained.</p>
<p>The mention of Karbila’i Muhammad Ja’far, upon him be the Glory of God, reached Our hearing, and after its presentation before Us, this Supreme Word was revealed and sent down from the horizon of the heaven of Sinai, blessed and exalted be His Words:</p>
<p>O Ja’far! By the life of God, the Wronged One hath borne that which the world was and is powerless to bear. The purpose is that in this Dawn of Revelation a breeze of the grace of God, exalted be His Glory, might waft, adorning the outward with the ornament of justice and fairness, and purifying the inward - that is, the hearts and souls - from rancor and hatred toward the peoples of the world. That which is conducive to the elevation of existence and the advancement of souls hath been revealed and sent down from the Pen of God in clear and explicit terms in the Sacred Scriptures and Tablets. However, attentive ears, penetrating eyes, expanded breasts, and illumined hearts are rarer than red sulphur. O My party! The grief and sorrow of this Wronged One have not been, nor are they, from what hath befallen Him at the hands of His enemies. Rather, from those who claim to love Him there appeared that which caused the rock to cry out, the clouds to lament, and all else besides God to exclaim ‘Alas!’ It is better that this matter remain veiled lest the hearts of My loved ones and chosen ones be saddened. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee and aid thee in that which will exalt thee amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>From the mention and exposition of the loving-kindness of the Goal of the world’s peoples toward His loved ones, it is clear and evident. I beseech God to illumine His loved ones with the fire of utterance and the light of exposition in such wise that all horizons may be illumined, so that through the manifestation of spiritual deeds and virtuous character the people of the world may turn toward the Straight Path and the Great Announcement, and may see themselves purified from the murk and dust of doubts and the allusions of the people. His mercy hath encompassed all, and His grace, like unto the sun, shineth forth and is manifest from the horizon of every letter of the letters of His Book. Verily, our Lord is the Helper, the Giver, the Generous.</p>
<p>God willing, the aforementioned fragment shall be sent specifically to Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, that the eyes of whomsoever desireth it may be gladdened thereby. And one blessed fragment in the handwriting of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto the dust of His footsteps - shall be sent specifically to Ibn-i-Dakhil, upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the receipt and delivery of the blessed Tablets intended for the friends in Bonab and Miyanduab, this was truly a manifest glad tiding that increased the power of vision. Praise be to God that those regions are blessed. At one time this supreme blessed word was heard from the Master of all beings - exalted be His glory: “O thou who art present! Had We been in another country and had this grace that raineth down upon Iran in the form of Tablets been bestowed upon other lands, most assuredly would the majority of the people in foreign cities and regions have turned toward the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness.” Verily, this is so - they know how many verses were revealed and how many evidences appeared. Each of God’s Tablets was the greatest key to the treasures of inner meanings, and none has denied its station and rank. In these days, one of the chosen ones spoke this word of the Master of all beings, writing from the Land of Ta that the servants are humbled before the appearance of the pearls of wisdom and utterance revealed from the treasury of the Supreme Pen, and none has been observed to deny or disapprove. Nevertheless, the intoxication of self and passion has so seized them that even while acknowledging, they are seen to deny - for though their words are heard and witnessed, deeds are non-existent. Had they succeeded in deeds, the portions of the world would now be seen as one portion and would be reckoned as part of the Most Glorious Paradise. A hundred thousand regrets that until now they have not understood or become aware of true loss and gain. I testify that they are among the heedless.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Mulla Husayn (M.Y.), upon him be the Glory of God, after it was presented before the Most Holy Court, He said: “O Husayn! Take My Book with a power that the might of the world cannot prevent thee, and with a strength that the clamor of the nations cannot weaken thee, and with a steadfastness that neither the doubts of the suspicious ones, nor the clamor of the barking ones, nor the attack of kings, nor the retreat of sovereigns can cause thee to slip. We have turned toward thee at this time and have revealed for thee that which the treasuries of the heavens and earth cannot equal. Rejoice and say: ‘Thine is the praise, O Lord of the worlds, and Thine is the glory, O Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones.’”</p>
<p>As for the matter of Huquq, they have been blessed with true forgiveness. God hath forgiven him as a favor from His presence. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. However, it is hoped that they will occupy themselves with guiding people, that perchance through divine wisdom and revealed utterances they may awaken heedless souls and cause them to be nourished from the Kawthar of recognition. Verily our Lord is the Helper, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of all the worlds! Ponder thou upon His Manifestation and His signs. The showers of wisdom and utterance are falling in all times from the heaven of merciful bounty and the clouds of divine wisdom, and the Sun of power, majesty and might is shining forth above the horizon of the world before the faces of all peoples, manifest and evident, while the pearls of knowledge are, at all times, appearing and becoming visible from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen. The light is radiant, the ocean is surging, yet all remain veiled and extinct save whom thy Lord willeth.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Hearken thou with the ear of the spirit to the cry of Him Who is wronged, and pass beyond the world and all who dwell therein. Fix thy gaze at all times upon this most exalted Word which hath dawned from the horizon of the Mother Book. Thus sayeth He, blessed and exalted be He: “O friends of God in His earth, His chosen ones in His lands, and His party among His creatures! Purify your hearts from the stories of the past, through attachment to which the feet of the people of the past have slipped, those who prided themselves over the world and all peoples.”</p>
<p>O Ahmad! We desire to give thee to drink of the Kawthar of utterance that it may sanctify thee from the doubts and imaginings whereby the Shi’ih were prevented from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Hear thou the call from the horizon of this heaven and take what thou art commanded. This will deliver thee through His grace and acquaint thee with His mighty Message.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The people of the Sunnah did not issue the decree for the martyrdom of the Lord of the world, nor did they seek to hold fast to the imaginary Jabulqa and Jabulsa, and the Jews did not reject the Beauty of the Manifestation, nor did they issue the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Ponder thou well! The Pen from which the counsel of God floweth and the Word of God appeareth hath now turned towards thee and maketh mention of thee. Say: O people! If ye attain not unto the light of faith, at least free yourselves from the darkness of the Shi’ih party. By the life of God! They have done that which neither the idol-worshippers according to their words, nor the worshippers of vain imaginings have done. Would that thou couldst hear the clamor of the pulpits of Iran! Each one speaketh with eloquent tongue, and each uttereth words at every moment, saying: “My God, my God! Thou didst create me for Thy remembrance and praise, yet now Thou hearest from him who hath mounted upon me the reviling of Thee and Thy loved ones. Would that I had not been planted and had not been created!”</p>
<p>O Ahmad! What were the claims of that party and what became of their deeds? Ponder, that thou mayest be of them that are firmly established. O Ahmad! If but one drop from this ocean should appear, or if but one word from the Hidden Scroll which is recorded in the Crimson Tablet should come forth and it be said to cut off thine own neck with thine own hand – verily the Truth hath come for eternal life, not for death. He hath commanded all to preserve the Cause. The Truth Himself beareth witness and the Tablets testify.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me while I was in prison, and for having turned towards me when I was heedless of Thy manifestation and Thy dawning and Thy power. I beseech Thee by Thy Cause which Thou hast made the cause of the existence of the world and the appearance of all peoples, that Thou make me steadfast in what hath been revealed and cause me to hold fast unto Thy strong cord and Thy manifest tidings.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual friend, Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God. After submission before the Most Holy Court, this supreme gift was revealed from the horizon of the heaven of bestowal, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>“The A and H and their associates have all attained to that which is the greatest means for the guidance of nations. Their names have been planted in the lands of divine knowledge. Its branches, twigs, leaves and fruits shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. We testify that they are among those who have attained in My perspicuous Book. Convey to all the greetings of the Wronged One and give them glad tidings of God’s infinite favors.”</p>
<p>And regarding the name of the friends, We have previously granted permission for two most exalted names or the names of the Branches. We beseech God to send down upon them mercy from the heaven of His bestowal and blessing from His presence. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>They wrote that Aqa ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, requested that if a carpet or something else worth forty or fifty tumans was needed, it be ordered and granted, and that if funds were required, they would be sent upon indication. After these matters were submitted before the Most Holy Court, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>“We have forgiven him as a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make him steadfast in His Cause and speaking in His praise. Praise be to God, he has attained to service, and whatsoever hath appeared is remembered and preserved with God. We give him glad tidings of My favor and remind him of My verses that the greatest joy may take hold of him in the days of God, the Lord of destiny and Creator of humanity. God willing, may he ignite with the fire of divine love those who are cold and guide them through the appearance of the lights of the Greatest Luminary.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveys greetings to him and the other friends. Praise be to God, they are mentioned as souls steadfast before God. It is hoped that each of the friends will arise to guide the servants and speak forth, but they must hold fast to wisdom in all conditions. Those who have attained the Most Holy Court have witnessed the deeds of the Branches of the Blessed Tree and the companions and have become aware. Confession and acknowledgment have been forbidden after forty years or more while the dawning-places of vain imaginings have been occupied with intrigues and deceptions and concealed behind vessels. One of those souls has appeared in these days and his station is evident - that is Mirza Hadi Dawlat-Abadi who resides in the land of Sad. In brief, in these days after the martyrdom of His Holiness Ashraf - may the souls of those near to God be sacrificed for him - they mentioned him by the name of Babi. Fear seized him and agitation led him to ascend the pulpit and renounce the Cause from beginning to end. That tyrannical soul committed, for the sake of two days of life, that which caused the reality of existence to lament. Now consider those souls who follow his like. The seeker and the sought have both lost, and that heedless oppressor is again occupied with leading people astray. Now the martyrdom of the most exalted martyr and the life of that heedless one are two mighty witnesses to the reality of the station and deeds of both. This matter has been mentioned repeatedly as it is good for awakening, that perchance the heedless may remember or fear. How many souls have freely sacrificed their lives in this Most Great Revelation - the knowledge thereof is with God, our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>New tidings: a group of the Afnan and Leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree and His Honor the Trustee, upon them be the Glory of God, the Lord of the worlds, attained the presence at the place of circumambulation of the Concourse on High on the twentieth of Ramadan. His Honor the Trustee repeatedly made mention of that beloved one. In truth he dearly loves the sincere ones and those near. Well is it with him!</p>
<p>His Honor Aqa Muhammad Husayn-i-Isku’i, upon him be the everlasting Glory of God, was mentioned at this time in the Most Holy and Most Glorious Court and was blessed to be heard, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke while seated upon the Throne of Bounty, blessed and exalted be His words:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! He who loved Me made mention of thee. We make mention of thee with that which causeth the Orb of Bounty to shine forth from the horizon of the Tablet of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Through it the Light hath shone and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of existence, hath been revealed. This is a Day wherein mysteries have appeared from the treasury of God’s wisdom, Lord of what was and what shall be. Verily He hath appeared with grace and ruled with justice. Blessed is the servant whom the veils of the divines did not withhold, nor was he frightened by the mighty ones who denied what was sent down from the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Say: O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not every ignorant rejected one. The veils have been rent asunder and the curtains drawn aside by the finger of Power, by the command of Him Who is the Lord of the seen and unseen. Blessed is the hearer who hath heard the Call and the seer who hath attained to behold the signs of God, the King, the Mighty, the Loving. When the fragrances of the verses take hold of thee, say:</p>
<p>“Glory be unto Thee, O God, O Manifestation of clear evidences and Lord of names and attributes! I beseech Thee by Thy light which hath shone forth from the horizon of Thy manifestation and illumined the regions of the cities of Thy grace and bounty, and by Thy command which hath encompassed all things, and by Thy sovereignty which hath overcome all who are in earth and heaven, to strengthen me in that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy bounty. O Lord! Thou seest the ignorant one desiring the ocean of Thy knowledge, and the sinful one the sea of Thy forgiveness and bounty. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him through Thy grace and bounty. Thou art He at Whose call all things have called out, and unto Whose name all who are in earth and heaven have bowed down in submission. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>As commanded, this blessed Tablet was also written in the hand of His Holiness the Most Great Branch (may my spirit be a sacrifice for the dust of His footsteps) and sent. We hope that through its verses the tears of the longing ones may fall. This weeping is the weeping of love and joy and is better than a hundred thousand gladnesses. Other lovers have attained this station. Well is it with them!</p>
<p>Mention was made of His Honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad, son of the late and forgiven one, upon them both be the Glory of God. Praise and thanks be to God, mention of them was again made in the gathering of those near and sincere. This servant hath ever besought the True One, exalted be He, to aid him in service that would cause the exaltation of the Word and manifest detachment. In any case, after this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court, one sacred Tablet specifically for him was revealed from the heaven of the favor of the Desired One of the worlds and was sent. I beseech Him, exalted is He, to attract him through His verses and draw him nigh through His grace and sanctify him from all that befitteth not His days. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>And mention was made of His Honor Mirza Muhammad Kh-A and Mirza ’Ali, upon them both be the Glory of God. After presentation before His presence these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of Will. Mighty be His utterance and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Manifest before the faces of all religions […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! The divine verses have encompassed the worlds of the seen and unseen, and the effulgences of the Sun of His Revelation have cast their rays upon all. By My life! The ocean of utterance hath appeared with such waves as have never been witnessed from the beginning of the world until now. Yet the heedless servants have deprived themselves in this Revelation of the outpourings of the Speaker of Sinai. They cling to desire, turn away from righteousness, are far from truth, and hold fast to the vain imaginings of men. We beseech God to assist thee that thou mayest arise to serve His Cause with complete steadfastness and drink from the wine of His favors. Glory be to God! All parties are engaged in the mention of the Lord of all men and speak His praise, yet most are heedless of the Truth. In all conditions We ask for all that which will bring creation into being anew and adorn it with everlasting ornament. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Aqa Mirza ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous</p>
<p>O ’Ali! What was, has passed, and what will be, is yet to come. One must regard this moment as precious and hold fast to that which is befitting. Today every tree hath its mention and every clod its utterance. By the Sun of Truth! The hearing ear perceiveth from all things the cry “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all mankind.” In the East He appeareth and His signs are manifest from the West, and in the West He sitteth upon the throne of utterance while His call is raised from the East. We beseech God to assist His loved ones and not deprive them of the splendors of the Light of utterance. He is the Bestower, the Giver, the Generous, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>In the name of each one floweth a Salsabil and streameth a Kawthar. From an empty vessel, how many pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared and continue to appear! Blessed is he who hath eyes to see and ears to hear the call of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of this noble station.</p>
<p>After mentioning the namesake of the Intended One, the son of him who ascended unto God - upon them both be the Most Glorious Glory of God, from God, the Lord of all beings - these exalted words were revealed from the ocean of grace and bounty and the Dawning-place of attributes and names. His Word, exalted be His majesty and all-encompassing be His bounty:</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Repeatedly hath thy mention been made, and there hath been revealed in thy name from the Most Exalted Pen that which testifieth to the grace, mercy and loving-kindness of God, exalted be His glory. Every possessor of spiritual sense hath inhaled from the verses the fragrance of bounties, and every possessor of insight hath found his way to the most exalted horizon through beholding the signs. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee from the heaven of bounty that which will draw thee nigh unto Him and to ordain for thee, by His Most Exalted Pen, the reward of attaining His presence and meeting Him. Verily, He is the Kind, the Generous, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We wish to make mention of thy wife who hath believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. O My handmaiden and My leaf! He Who hath loved Me and circled round My Cause hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee through this Most Great Remembrance that it may draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath heard thy call and revealed for thee that which shall endure as long as His Name, the All-Compelling over all names, shall endure. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. Rejoice in My loving-kindness and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and enabled me to turn unto Thee on a Day whereon the hearts of the doubters among Thy servants were sorely agitated. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Triumphant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>The splendor be upon you and upon your sons and daughters from God, the Revealer of this clear Remembrance. To Him belongs all praise and glory, and to Him belongs all bounty and commendation. Each of the mentioned souls has attained to that which has no equal, and this servant also beseeches from God, exalted be His glory, for each one that which causes the eternal river to flow and the everlasting fragrance to be manifest. Verily our Lord is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth through His blessed, mighty and wondrous Word.</p>
<p>Regarding the meeting, the path is distant and there are obstacles and impediments present. Therefore, permission was withheld due to the arrival of the governor. For now, there are certain discussions among the people. We beseech God to remove the impediment through His power. Verily He is the Strong, the Powerful.</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, mention was made of the Ayns - upon them be the glory of God, His mercy and His bounty. Each was mentioned in His presence and each has attained to the waves of the ocean of grace. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid them to serve His Cause that they may assist the Lord with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the spiritual friend, his honor Ayn and Ba, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God and His most resplendent light. He has always been and continues to be remembered, and in these days detailed news of them has arrived. Praise be to God, they are firm in the Cause and steadfast in service. Upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you all and upon those who are with you and who hear your words concerning this mighty and wondrous Cause. And praise be to God, the Powerful, the Single, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>12th of Shawwal 1306</p>
<p>The petition of his honor Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Asghar (Usku’i) - upon him be 96 [Baha’ullah] - after being presented, permission to proceed was granted. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him in turning towards Him and in acceptance. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Likewise regarding the proceeding of his honor Mashhadi Hasan - upon him be 96 [Baha’ullah] - if it occurs with wisdom. In all cases they must be mindful of wisdom, for its opposite is not beloved. The glory be upon them both.</p>
<p>=== END BH00080 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00081 ===</p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Praise be to God Who hath caused the tongues of the eloquent to speak forth with wondrous expressions of praise and thanksgiving, and Who hath manifested the pure camphor of love and faithfulness in the hearts of them that are possessed of love and sincerity. And praise be to God Who hath caused the seas of light to surge amidst the darkness of deepest night, and Who hath stirred up the breezes of joy from the right hand of the verdant spot above Mount Sinai, the place of revelation and presence before the manifestation of the All-Forgiving Lord.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath illumined the lamps of guidance in the hearts of them that are endued with certitude, and Who hath adorned the brocade of hearts with love for His Beauty, the All-Compelling, the Bestower, and Who hath caused the pens of them that are endowed with knowledge to flow with wondrous expressions of praise for His countenance, the Mighty, the Help in Peril.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath caused the drops of bounty to overflow upon the gardens of existence which have become verdant and flourishing, and have appeared after being hidden, and emerged after being concealed, and have been quickened after having perished, through the breezes of God’s wondrous grace and bounty wafting from the direction of His loving kindness - He, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath raised up the clouds of His Cause in the heaven of might and power, and Who hath caused the sun of grace to shine forth from behind the veil of glory and concealment, and Who hath illumined the hearts of them that are possessed of certitude with the lights of that Sun dawning from the horizon of Will and Purpose - praise befitting His Beauty Who is established upon the throne of glory and certitude, praise worthy of His Countenance Who is seated upon the seat of grandeur and grace.</p>
<p>A praise whereby the sincere may ascend to the heaven of the sacred Sinai of divine knowledge, and the near ones may rise to the ultimate heights of the atmosphere of faith’s mighty realm, and the cherubim may drink from the rivers of the pure camphor of love and goodly favor.</p>
<p>I send blessings and peace upon the Point which God hath made the ornament of the stream of utterance, and the source for the manifestation of creation of the Most Merciful, and the beginning for the completion of God’s proof to all the worlds, and upon those who have been illumined by the lights of the splendor of His face and who have walked in the paths of His glorious Beauty’s good-pleasure - abundant, endless, eternal and everlasting blessings.</p>
<p>And now, after the decree was fulfilled and destiny came to pass that I should sprinkle upon all who are in earth and heaven from the sweet Kawthar water which the Most Merciful caused to flow in the heart of man, making it life for the people of knowledge and joy and delight for those who have walked in the paths of faith, I begin with Bismillah in the interpretation of this blessed verse from the surah of the Quran, seeking His aid at every moment and His assistance at all times, relying and depending upon Him in all conditions, for verily He is the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>O thou who art listening! If thou desirest to reach the ocean of meanings which surgeth in the land of the heart, and to witness the waves of the sea of realities which billoweth in the hearts of those possessed of love and righteousness, then hear what I speak in this moment as I sit before God and rest upon the dust of servitude before His face.</p>
<p>Know thou that this verse hath meanings which none among the people of creation can reckon save him whom God, the Lord of earth and heaven, doth aid. And for this water sent down from this heaven there are in every station meanings of which we now mention some, that perchance thou mayest detach thyself from all that was and shall be, and turn unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>In the first station, we interpret this heaven as the heaven of Will, and this water as the water of divine revelation - that is, when God, exalted be He, desired to manifest in all created things a revelation from the revelations of His Beauty, and to place in each one of them a trace from the traces of His Majesty, that perchance through witnessing it the hearts of the knowers might be quickened and the hearts of them that are nigh might be gladdened, He sent down the water of divine revelation […]</p>
<p>Know that when the lights of Divine Unity and the effulgence of the radiance of Oneness dawned upon the manifestations of creation from the heaven of Will and the atmosphere of Purpose, nothing came into being except that it served to guide souls to the Dawning-Place of creation and His bountiful Countenance. In this station may be understood what was mentioned aforetime in the tradition: “I have not seen a thing except that I saw God before it, after it, or with it.”</p>
<p>As to the second station, We interpret “heaven” as the heaven of mystic knowledge and “water” as the water of divine recognition - that is, He sent down from the heaven of His knowledge and the water of His recognition that which would quicken the hearts of the mystics through this flowing, crystal stream from the right hand of the Divine Throne. Through drinking this water, the wise one attains to the paradise of reunion with God, and the believer enters the garden of the divine presence in such wise that he sees naught but the manifestation of God, and beholds nothing among all things save the radiance of God’s beauty. But O hearer! I fear lest in this moment thy feet should slip from this manifest path, and doubt arise in thy heart concerning what We have explained regarding the servant’s attainment to the garden of reunion and meeting. Know that what is meant by this reunion is attainment to one of His manifestations, and this knowledge is the servant’s recognition according to his own capacity and station. For God, glorified and exalted be He, hath ever been sanctified above the recognition of the mystics, hallowed beyond the certitude of those possessed of certainty, and exalted above the comprehension of those endowed with understanding. The highest knowledge and most perfect utterance can never ascend to the heaven of recognizing even that manifestation which He hath deposited in any created thing - how much less the recognition of His own sacred Essence! By Him Who holdeth all command and creation in His grasp, were the veil to be lifted by a single word, no being would remain on earth that could behold His beauty or gaze upon His countenance or observe the wondrous signs of His sovereignty. As He hath said in His Book, exalted be He: “Were We to emerge from the garment We have donned due to your weakness, all who are in the heavens and earth would sacrifice their souls for My sake,” and so forth. Yet due to His abundant grace, generosity, bounty and loving-kindness, when He saw the weakness of humanity, He veiled His beauty and concealed His countenance from the gaze of all else.</p>
<p>In the third station, We interpret “heaven” as the heaven of wisdom and “water” as the water of wisdom - that is, He sent down this water for the wise ones from that heaven and gave them to drink of this Kawthar which surges like a vast ocean and billows like a tempestuous sea. He provided them this heavenly table sent down from the heaven of His wisdom to His earth for the sake of His creation, that they might understand the balance of nature, the properties of medicines, and ultimately recognize the power through which God created these diverse and contrary things, these plants varying in their properties and forms.</p>
<p>In the fourth station, We interpret this heaven as the heaven of knowledge and this water as the water of knowledge - that is, when God, exalted be He, witnessed that people were ignorant and heedless, knowing nothing on earth and comprehending not an atom’s weight in His kingdom, He therefore sent down upon them this sweet, flowing water descending from this heaven raised above the heavens, and gave them to drink of this pure wine for the recognition of the Manifestation and the understanding of what was revealed from the tongue of His glorious and forgiving Beauty. Yet due to their abundant heedlessness and lack of understanding, they knew not the fundamental purpose and true intention, and they poured this water upon barren ground, rendering it useless and void by watering earth from which nothing would grow - namely their hearts, which were devoid of the knowledge of God[…]</p>
<p>They rendered it fruitless and void by watering the earth from which nothing grows - namely their hearts, which are devoid of the knowledge of God and have become empty of the light of His love. Yet every person of understanding, were they to reflect, would comprehend that the essential purpose and original intent of knowledge is the recognition of the Known One and the understanding of that which flows from His mighty and manifest Pen, not those vain imaginings that profit them not. Woe unto them and their deeds! Leave them to their idle play, for God recompenses all things, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>In the fifth station, we interpret ‘heaven’ as the heaven of bounty, and the ‘water’ descending therefrom has various meanings according to this interpretation. In the first meaning, it is what God has bestowed upon creation through utterance, speech, power, might, stillness, motion, perception, expression, vision and certitude. In the second meaning, it is what He has sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness in terms of pleasant spiritual gifts and subtle, refined blessings.</p>
<p>If thou hast understood the meaning of heaven and water, then consider what hath been explained unto thee subsequently, that thou mayest attain to that which will make thee independent of all else. Know then that the meaning of “valleys” in the first interpretation we gave previously refers to the realities of all created things of every kind. That is, when the water of revelation descended from the heaven of divine Will and the atmosphere of Purpose, every valley received of this water according to its capacity and took from it a portion according to its capability.</p>
<p>Even as thou dost witness that in all things there is a sign from the signs of thy Lord and a manifestation from the manifestations of thy Creator, each according to its nature, measure and capacity. For instance, water symbolizes the mercy that flows in the land of bounty for the people of existence, while fire symbolizes His wrath which is reserved for the polytheists among creation. And thou canst measure all things according to this pattern.</p>
<p>In the second interpretation which we explained before, we interpret “valleys” to mean the mystics - that is, when the water of divine knowledge descended from the heaven of spiritual recognition, each one understood according to their station and rank, and the valleys of their hearts flowed according to their capacity with this pure, delicate, sweet and subtle water.</p>
<p>In the third interpretation which we explained before, we interpret “valleys” to mean wisdom - that is, when the water of wisdom descended from the heaven of divine wisdom, each one partook according to their measure and praise, and each one understood according to their comprehension and recognition.</p>
<p>In the fourth interpretation which we explained before, regarding knowledge - that is, when the water of knowledge descended from the heaven of divine knowledge, each one partook according to their measure and rank, and the valleys of their hearts flowed according to their capacity, and each one understood according to their comprehension and perception.</p>
<p>In the fifth interpretation which we explained regarding what God has bestowed of power and might, or what He has given of earthly material means and worldly subtle bounties.</p>
<p>As for “the torrent bearing swelling foam” - in the station of the first meaning which we interpreted as divine revelation, it is thus: when this water descended from that heaven, it bore away the realities of existing things, for thou seest that everything perishes save that which guides people to God and benefits those of insight who gaze upon the Most Great Vision. As it is stated at the end of the verse: “As for the foam, it passeth away as scum upon the banks, while that which is of benefit to mankind remaineth on the earth.” For everything thou beholdest in this world shall perish except the sign of God’s revelation which the All-Merciful has deposited within its reality.</p>
<p>And those who gaze upon the Most Great Scene, as mentioned in the latter part of the verse: “As for the foam, it passeth away as scum; and as for that which profiteth mankind, it remaineth on the earth,” for all that is witnessed in the world shall perish save the sign of God’s revelation which the All-Merciful hath deposited in its essence, and this is that which benefiteth mankind and guideth them to the path of God, the Lord of earth and heaven and the Creator of all things. In another station We interpret this verse according to its outward meaning, saying that its intent is like unto the passing of the world and all that is therein, as a lesson to those who turn unto Him and seek His ways, even as mentioned in the verse: “That which they heat in the fire for the sake of ornaments or utensils, it hath scum like unto it,” meaning that whatsoever ye witness in the world of all religions is foam that shall pass away like unto this passing foam. And in yet another station We interpret this water as the Muhammadan Reality which God hath manifested for the life of the world and their guidance unto the path of God, the Lord of all peoples, and the valleys signify the hearts of the people of Islam, meaning that each valley took of this water according to its measure, and this water flowed in the valleys of their hearts according to their capacity, station and receptivity. And in another station We interpret the water as that which God revealed unto Him of His verses and ordinances, which is the Qur’an, and it is the water of which He said in description: “And of water have We made every living thing,” which quickeneth the hearts of the servants when it descendeth from the heaven of the Lord of creation. And We interpret the foam as the rules of ignorance and vain customs that existed in the time of paganism, meaning that when this water descended from heaven and each valley flowed according to its measure, then this foam passed away as scum and this water remained, as thou witnessest today how the carpet of ignorance was rolled up in a brief time, and this pure, clear, delicate water remained in the earth. And in another station We interpret this water as the water of guidance which descended from the heaven of the Divine Will for the guidance of those who were heedless of God’s remembrance and His sovereignty, even as God, exalted be He, hath said: “And He found thee wandering, and guided thee.” And in another station We interpret it as the water of wealth which descended from the heaven of the bounty of the Sovereign of existence, even as God hath said: “And He found thee poor, and made thee rich.” And in yet another station We interpret this water as the water of steadfastness which the All-Merciful sent down for Muhammad, His Beloved, whereby his feet were made firm upon His path in such wise that he stood against all who were on earth with mighty sovereignty, and the valleys of the hearts of the believers flowed with this water whereby their feet were made firm in the path of their Creator. And in another station We interpret this water as the water of power, might, authority and glory which God sent down for Muhammad - peace be upon him and his family - His Beloved, His Prophet, His Messenger and the Manifestation of His Cause among His creatures. And in another station We interpret it as that which God sent down upon the Beloved of divine governance and earthly wisdom and the foundations of justice in creation and equity in existence. And in yet another station We interpret this water which descended from that heaven as the essence of the Prophets and the nature of the chosen ones, meaning that when God made them manifest from the heaven of Will and caused them to descend to earth from the atmosphere of Purpose, the valleys of the hearts of those who were with them flowed according to their measure and stood firm in their Cause in their days, and this torrent carried away the foam of deeds which they had performed contrary to God’s good-pleasure before believing, even as the tax collectors in the time of Christ’s appearance […]</p>
<p>The troubled waters of their deeds, which they performed without God’s good-pleasure before belief, carried forth a foam, just as in the time of Christ’s appearance and the dawning of that mighty Luminary, when the tax collectors, upon witnessing His beauty and beholding His signs, turned toward Him and forsook all else, partaking of these sweet waters according to their capacity. The foam of their previous misdeeds vanished, cast aside. Similarly, observe this in the appearance of all the Prophets.</p>
<p>In another sense, We interpret the heaven as the Prophets, and the water as that which floweth from them of God’s signs, His attributes, His manifestation and His expressions through unity, utterance, knowledge and wisdom. When the valleys of hearts were filled with this water, all foam consisting of people’s sayings, understanding and wisdom was cast aside, disregarded by those who gaze upon the Most Great Vision.</p>
<p>In yet another sense, We interpret this water as the trials that descended from the heaven of destiny in the days of the Prophets’ appearance, and the foam as the ailments and pains arising therefrom. These pass away like foam cast aside, while God’s Cause endureth in the earth, benefiting mankind and guiding them to the path of God, the Lord of Names, detaching them from all that exists between earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, We interpret this water as the patience and forbearance which God sent down upon His chosen ones, His trusted ones, His faithful and pure ones, and the foam as the humiliation and trials that descended upon them. For these pass away, cast aside, while that which endureth in the earth is the reward of their patience in God’s path and their forbearance in face of God’s decree.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to speak forth the wonders of Thy remembrance and praise, and loosened my tongue to express comprehensive interpretations of Thy verses. Thou art He Who, O my God, hath seated Himself upon the throne of grace and bounty, and established Himself upon the seat of generosity and acceptance. I beseech Thee to bestow upon Thy servants the wonders of Thy generosity and gifts, and to show mercy unto Thy bondsmen through the totality of Thy grace and bounties.</p>
<p>O my God! Darkness hath encompassed the people of Thy earth; cause the light of Thy guidance to shine forth in perfect radiance, through Thy glory and favor, that the people might emerge from the darkness of self and passion, hoping to gaze upon Thy gate and seeking to attain to the atmosphere of Thy Cause. For Thou art the King, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, through the wonders of Thy generosity and bounty, to make our feet firm in Thy Cause and establish our steps in Thy Religion. Make our tongues, O my God, speak forth Thy remembrance and praise, our eyes turn toward the wondrous lights of the beauty of Thy glory, our ears hearken to Thy holy verses of eternity, and our mouths drink from the chalices of Thy bounty. Thou art He Who hath no partner in Thy dominion nor peer in Thy creation. Thou givest to whom Thou willest what Thou willest, and withholdest from whom Thou willest what Thou willest. Thou art indeed the Single One, the Unique, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down verses from the kingdom of grandeur and power, and made them a proof for all who dwell in the heavens and the earth, that all might be assured that there is no God but Him. He hath been from the beginning that hath no beginning a sovereign omnipotent, and will be unto the end that hath no end a sovereign omnipotent.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath caused to flow from the Pen that which guideth mankind unto the Lord of Eternity and teacheth man that which he knoweth not, that all may testify that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Beloved and Exalted, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Beloved and Exalted.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath raised the clouds of His Cause in the heaven of power and hath rained down upon the soil of hearts the wonders of His grace and bounty, that all may know that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Sought After and Glorious, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Sought After and Glorious.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath caused the sun of tribulation to shine forth from the horizon of the heaven of destiny and made it illuminate the hearts of those who circle round the sanctuary of grandeur, that all may understand that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Merciful and Joyous, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Merciful and Joyous.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath lifted the veil from the face of His Cause and raised it to such heights that the intoxication of its call hath seized all who dwell in the realms of creation and command, that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Worshipped and Unapproachable, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Worshipped and Unapproachable.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath caused to grow from the gardens of hearts the plants of love and detachment, adorning them with the ornament of the remembrance of the Lord of Names, that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One All-Knowing and Exalted, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One All-Knowing and Exalted.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath manifested the Point of Beginning and made it the Herald of the appearance of the Temple of the Seal, that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Powerful and Mighty, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Powerful and Mighty.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath ordained what He willeth and desireth - for His loved ones, union and meeting with Him, and for His enemies, separation and estrangement from Him - that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Bestowing and Decreeing, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Bestowing and Decreeing.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath ordained imprisonment for Us through the wondrous operation of His irrevocable decree, and We thank Him for what He hath ordained for Us through the wonders of His decree and the totality of His command, that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Sovereign and Bountiful, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Sovereign and Bountiful.</p>
<p>Blessed be God Who hath sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness the water of generosity and hath caused to grow therefrom in the meadows of existence the trees of love and certitude through His Beauty, the Mighty, the Bestower, that all may be assured that there is none other God but Him. He was from the beginning that hath no beginning, One Gracious and Unapproachable, and will continue unto the end that hath no end, One Gracious and Unapproachable.</p>
<p>And thou, O thou who gazeth toward God and walketh in the paths of His love and good-pleasure, know that I now pour forth upon thee from the ocean of inner meanings and utterance, which God hath deposited within the heart of man through His all-embracing favor over all that was and will be, concerning what thou hast asked Me about the stories of the Prophets who appeared from the horizon of grandeur and majesty with manifest sovereignty. And as for what God, exalted be He, said: “And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas, though I march on for ages,” know thou that when Moses reached the most exalted stations […]</p>
<p>And when Moses said to his youth: “I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I journey for ages.” Know thou that when Moses reached the most exalted stations and traversed the paths of eternity and was illumined by the lights of grandeur and majesty, he desired to draw nigh unto the Tree of Divine decree and the Lote-Tree of the uttermost boundary, that he might behold what was ordained in the preserved tablet. Then said he to his youth: “I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I journey for ages.” And by “youth” is meant his pure and blessed grandfather, for he was the divine youth in whom shone forth the sun of prophethood through heavenly grace, though the people know it not. And verily he was the one who was illumined by the manifestations of the lights of the Kingdom and who was nourished by the fruits of the Tree of Sinai which glowed on the Mount of eternity with evident radiance. And verily he was the youth who bore the mysteries of God and His treasures, if ye be of them that know. And verily he was the shell wherein was found the hidden pearl which was the very essence of the Interlocutor that gleamed forth from the lights of eternity and shone with the radiance of the Most Great Name, though few among the people know this.</p>
<p>Then know, O thou who walkest in the path of God and gazest upon the beauty of God, that what is meant by the junction of the two seas is the sea of Prophethood and the sea of Divinity - that is, until I reach the station where I attain unto the sea of Divine Lordship which surgeth within itself, and each of its waves proclaimeth that there is none other God but Him, Who created creation from nothing by His command “Be! and it is,” and brought the contingent world into being from naught by His word - and He is the Mighty, the Beloved. And in another sense, we interpret the first sea as the sea of divine knowledge and the second sea as the sea of attainment - that is, when shall I make my sea of knowledge of the Tree of God’s decree connect with the sea of attaining unto it, and descending into its precincts, and finding intimacy with it, and arriving at its courts. This is the essential meaning.</p>
<p>Then observe what the Exalted One saith: “But when they reached the junction thereof, they forgot their fish, which took its way into the sea, being free.” That is, when they reached the junction of the two seas and the sea of knowledge connected with the sea of attainment, as mentioned before, they forgot their fish, as ye can see. Know that what is meant in this verse by the fish are worldly affairs and physical nature which exist in the visible realm. That is, when they reached that sea, they forgot all they had in the worlds of creation and returned to their source, their origin and their wellspring. And this is an inevitable truth, for when man becomes immersed in the sea of divine knowledge and reaches the surging ocean of reality in the realm of eternity, he casts off the two sandals of worldly concerns and carnal desires, if ye be of them that understand.</p>
<p>Then the Interlocutor addressed his grandfather, as the Exalted One saith: “And when they had passed on, he said unto his youth: ‘Bring us our morning meal; truly we have found fatigue in this our journey.’” And in this address he desired that true spirit which was Moses’ very self and essence to inform of the forgetting of that which befitted not that station, as ye acknowledge. Then the body answered him saying: “Didst thou see, when we betook ourselves to the rock? I forgot the fish - and none made me forget it but Satan - that I should mention it. It took its way into the sea in a marvelous manner!” Know thou that what is meant by the rock in this verse is the barrier that exists between the spiritual and physical worlds. As for “and none made me forget it but Satan,” it was revealed in this station according to the understanding of the people and flowed in accordance with their comprehension from the tongue of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, for none can ordain save God Who giveth what He willeth unto whom He willeth.</p>
<p>And it flowed according to their capacity from the Tongue of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, for none can ordain save God. He giveth what He willeth to whom He willeth, and withholdeth from whom He willeth what He willeth, according to the measure He willeth for whom He willeth, and He ordaineth for whom He willeth what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Praised. When the Point of the Divine Will, and the Divine Ornament, and the Heavenly Light, and the Manifestation of Divinity–may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for Him–changed the word of evil to good, He effaced the name of Satan and established in its place the name of the All-Merciful, and this is the essence of what was intended, for this forgetfulness was desired in this station. And since the people were heedless of the meanings of this verse and recognized forgetfulness as being from Satan, it was therefore revealed in His name from the holy tongue of the Beloved. Then the Truth of Moses answered Him and said: “That is what we were seeking.” Then they went back, returning in search of that which they were seeking, by the grace of God, the Protector, the Worshipped. Then found they one of Our servants upon whom We had bestowed mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Our presence. The intended meaning of this servant in this verse is the Tree of Divine Decree and the Lote-Tree of Command, and God referred to it as “servant” for the understanding of the people, and this is the essential meaning, were the people to know it. That is, when Moses forgot the fish and reached the junction of the two seas and drew near to the Tree of Divine Decree, he said to it: “Shall I follow thee that thou mayest teach me of that which thou hast been taught as to what is right?” Then that Tree addressed him and said: “Verily, thou canst never have patience with me. And how canst thou have patience concerning that which thou hast no knowledge?” unto the end thereof. Know thou, O questioner about the intended meaning and seeker of the knowledge of the true meaning which was in this verse revealed from the Tongue of God’s Will, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that all that was revealed regarding the servant meant the diversity and differences of divine decrees, and man’s inability to comprehend them and grasp what appears from them. God is witness to what I say, and for this reason He said: “Verily, thou canst never have patience with me.” And this is clear and evident. And in another sense, when Moses reached the ultimate goal of his desire and drank from the pure wine of immortality which flowed from the divine spring ending at the Most Great, Most Splendid Name, he then desired to find intimacy with that Most Great Name. When he reached the junction of the two seas and forgot the fish at the rock, and desired to ascend to that station, he heard the most wondrous and sweetest voice from beyond the sea of grandeur from the Tree of Sinai saying: “Verily, thou canst never have patience with me.” And this is a praiseworthy meaning. Say: O people, hearken unto what I speak at this time when I am seated before God and am established upon the dust of servitude unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: This is the essential purpose of the revelation of this verse. Beware lest ye interpret it according to your own desires. Fear God and be not of those who understand not. Glory be unto Thee, O God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name and Thy Most Ancient Beauty to guide the servants to the ocean of meanings and knowledge, lest they be veiled from the knowledge of Thy countenance or object to the Manifestation of Thy Cause. And I beseech Thee to illumine the eyes of all with the light of knowledge and to solace their eyes with the splendors of love and certitude, lest they become heedless of Thy praise or be veiled from the wondrous remembrances of the beauty of Thy holy identity, for they, O my God, are weak and Thou art the Mighty, the Great, and they, O my Beloved, are poor […]</p>
<p>They, O my Beloved, are poor, and Thou art the Mighty, the Bountiful. They, O my God, are distant, and Thou art the Near, the Merciful. They, O my God, are in darkness, and Thou art the Compassionate, the Forbearing. They wrong themselves and know not what they do. They sport morning and evening and understand not. They wander at all times and perceive not. They cast themselves into the fire and comprehend not.</p>
<p>Thou art He Who, O my God, didst deliver Adam from transgression, and Noah from the flood, and Hud from the tempestuous wind, and Salih from the rebellious people, and Lot from the wicked and the unbelievers, and Moses from the hands of Pharaoh and Haman, and Abraham from the hands of Nimrod and his followers unto oppression and loss. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and verily Thou art the Ruler over what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art He Who hath been from all eternity omnipotent over what Thou hast willed and wilt be unto all eternity dominant over what Thou pleasest. Thou art indeed the Powerful, the Generous, the Gracious, the Mighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And thou, O wayfarer in the path of justice and observer of the direction of grace, I shall now give thee to drink from the wine of inner meanings and utterance in explanation of what thou hast asked concerning the verse of the Qur’an, which appeareth thus in the Book of God, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the All-Knowing: “And they ask thee of Dhu’l-Qarnayn. Say: I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him. Lo! We made him powerful in the land and gave him unto everything a way.”</p>
<p>The intended meaning of Dhu’l-Qarnayn in this verse is the person of Muhammad himself - may the spirit of those nigh unto God be his sacrifice - for he was the possessor of prophethood and guardianship. Or we may interpret the two horns as referring to the Lord of the East and the West, for he was in the primal reality the master of the necks of all creation and sovereign over all beings by the leave of God, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>And in one station we interpret the two horns as the horn of steadfastness and virtue, as people witnessed that there was none like unto him in creation, as God the Exalted said addressing him: “And thou art of an exalted character.” And God sufficeth us at this time as witness. In another station we interpret the two horns as the Qur’an and the Law which God made as a remembrance and reminder for those who have turned toward the direction of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>God made for him an establishment in the earth and a firm station in sovereignty, and gave him the means of all things that he might establish truth and abolish falsehood, and make all the earth illumined with the light of God’s guidance - the Omnipotent, the Most High, the All-Knowing. For example, He revealed unto him the Qur’an to be a reminder for the people of remembrance, and the sword to be a lesson for the heedless.</p>
<p>“Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a people thereabout.” The intended meaning of this sun in the first station is the sun of God’s guidance which was about to set at the end of the Dispensation in muddy waters. What is meant by this is the darkness that had overtaken all people, or the heedlessness that had seized them from all directions, or the smoke of their deeds which had encompassed them from near and far.</p>
<p>In another station we interpret the sun as the sun of Religious Law which God made to rise in the earth for the guidance of all creation - that is, that sun was about to set in the muddy springs of the people’s heedlessness of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Or we interpret this sun as the sun of intellect which he saw setting in the muddy springs of ignorance of the tribes of the Age of Ignorance who were heedless of God, the Creator of the heavens and earths.</p>
<p>And in another station, We interpret the sun as the Sun of Divine Law which God made to rise in the earth for the guidance of all humanity. That is, this sun was about to set in murky waters of the heedlessness of the servants from God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. Or We interpret this sun as the sun of reason, which was seen setting in murky waters of ignorance of the tribes of the age of ignorance who were heedless of God, the Creator of the heavens and earths. Likewise We interpret this sun as the sun of divine knowledge and the murky waters as the hearts wherein these suns shine forth with great radiance, yet they remained among the heedless ones. Then God addressed the Seal of the Prophets from the horizon of the pavilion of grandeur and majesty, as God the Exalted said: “We said: ‘O Dhul-Qarnayn! Either thou dost punish them, or thou treatest them with kindness.’” That is, either thou leavest them in the wilderness of error wherein they dwelt before, or thou guidest them to the straight path unto God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Then the Messenger answered and said: “Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent back to his Lord; and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of. But whoever believeth and worketh righteousness, he shall have a goodly reward, and easy will be his task as we order it by our command.” Then followed he a way, until when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shelter from it. Even so! and We encompassed with Our Knowledge all that was with him. As for the rising-place of the sun, it was the station wherein that Mighty Light and Exalted Mystery rose forth. And those whose shelter was the lights of the sun are they who were guided by God’s guidance and were illumined by God’s lights and forsook all else but God and were among those heedless of aught save Him. These are they upon whom are blessings from their Lord, and they are those who drank the cup of eternity from the hands of the Will of God, Creator of earth and heaven. And upon them is the intoxication of divine knowledge to such degree that they have stripped from their temples the garment of this world. And God is witness to what I say. Then followed he a way until, when he reached a tract between two mountains, he found beneath them a people who scarcely understood a word. Know thou that God hath intended in these three stations to manifest the three ranks that existed among the people. As for what was mentioned in the first station, intended thereby are people who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. And as for what was mentioned in the second station, intended thereby are people who believed in God and were guided by the lights of God’s guidance and were illumined by the radiance of the Muhammadan Sun which shone forth from the dawning-place of oneness with wondrous manifestation and effulgence. And in the third station are intended those people who outwardly followed the Messenger - upon him be God’s blessings and peace - but inwardly were hypocrites in the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Exalted. They said: “O Dhul-Qarnayn! Verily Gog and Magog do great mischief in the earth: shall we then render thee tribute on condition that thou make a barrier between us and them?” And the speakers of this verse were the people mentioned in the second station. As for what is meant by Gog and Magog, these are the two parties who were in constant conflict in those days and caused corruption in the world. When Muhammad, the Messenger of God, the true and spiritual Dhul-Qarnayn appeared, he raised between them the barrier of faith and united them in the Cause of God, the All-Merciful, the Most Merciful. And in one station We interpret these two as the different parties that existed in the earth as enemies to the guided ones. And We have interpreted them likewise in the outward station.</p>
<p>Here is an elaborate allegory concerning Gog and Magog. In the outward sense, we have explained their meaning previously. However, in the inward sense, Gog and Magog represent the overwhelming forces of self and passion and heedlessness that arise from attachment to worldly affairs and its transient causes - if people were among those who understand. As for the first interpretation we gave before, know that when the companions who were guided by God’s light, the Mighty, the Bestower, witnessed the oppression and tyranny of people in the lands, they appealed to the true Dhul-Qarnayn to establish between them a barrier of might and power. He addressed them saying: “That wherein my Lord has established me is better, so assist me with strength and I will make between you and them a barrier. Bring me blocks of iron” - until when he had leveled between the two mountain sides, he said “Blow,” until when he had made it fire, he said “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.” So they could neither scale it nor tunnel through it.</p>
<p>That is to say: You desire outward victory, but that wherein my Lord has established me of inner conquest is better, so assist me - meaning, turn to me with pure hearts and sanctified souls so I may establish between all a barrier of faith that will be a greater defense than any constructed rampart. “Bring me blocks of iron” - meaning, bring me hearts firm as blocks of iron in the love of God, soaring in His path, steadfast in His mighty Cause. “Until when he had leveled between the two mountain sides” - we interpret these two sides as faith and unbelief, meaning until he filled between them so none remained in between (whom we previously interpreted as the hypocrites) and the forces of unbelief could not overcome the believers. “Blow until when he had made it fire” - meaning Dhul-Qarnayn told the believers to blow divine breath upon this barrier until God made it as fire. Then he said “Bring me molten copper to pour over it” - meaning, bring me strength of heart and inner certainty to pour over faith’s barrier until it becomes fortified by the grace of the All-Merciful, such that no storm can destroy it and Gog and Magog cannot surmount it or tunnel through it by God’s power, the King, the Generous, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O questioner, reflect upon what We have taught you of the jewels of mysteries and meanings, that you may become independent of the false statements and vain imaginings mentioned among people, and attain clear certainty that this is the essential meaning which no one has reached except those whom God has assisted with authority from His presence - truly He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. We have interpreted all these verses in their inner meaning since outwardly the people’s books are full of their interpretation. We ask God to expand your breast as He has expanded it, to preserve you in the shelter of His grace and care, and to bring you to a station where you will not turn to any direction except that you witness the dawning rays of the Sun of Beauty, the Lord of Names and Attributes, and be among the witnesses. And glory be upon you and upon whoever turns to God in these days wherein Mount Sinai is illumined by the splendor of His manifestation, and darkness is lit by that light, and the Tree of Sinai calls out with the most exalted call that the Beloved has appeared with magnificent beauty and glorious sovereignty.</p>
<p>=== END BH00081 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00082 ===</p>
<p>He is the One Who calls out with truth before the faces of creation!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who, through His power, caused the Sun of Utterance to shine forth and, through His sovereignty, the Moon of Proof to appear - He Who by His command rolled up what was spread out over six days, whereupon the heavens of knowledge were raised up in less than the twinkling of an eye, and the Greatest Scene was revealed when He Who conversed on Sinai established Himself upon the throne of manifestation. The Divine Lote-Tree spoke before all faces, and thereby the call was raised from earth and heaven: “This is a Manifestation that has caused existence, both seen and unseen, to smile, that has brought joy to all eyes and illumined all sight. The command is God’s, the One, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.”</p>
<p>By God! The Day has come, yet the people are in wondrous doubt. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist His servants to draw nigh unto the Dayspring of lights, to grant them success in returning to the gate of His grace and in making good what they have missed during the Lord of Days. And may peace and blessings, glorification and splendor rest upon the Hands of His Cause, whom neither the clamor of the people prevented from drawing near to God, the Lord of lords. They cast aside all else and turned to Him with such steadfastness as broke the backs of the wicked. Neither the opposition of the opposers nor the objections of the polytheists - who speak according to their idle fancies to turn people away from the straight path - could deter them. Say: He has come with that which draws you to the supreme horizon and brings you near to a station illumined by the lights of your Lord’s utterance, the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of everlasting life from the hand of bounty and for having arisen to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as has disturbed those who sit still and caused the factions to lament, save those whom God, thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Resurrection, has willed. Praise be to God that thou art at all times occupied with remembrance and praise, and art steadfast in service.</p>
<p>Know of a certainty that God has commanded all to proclaim His Cause and to exalt His authoritative Word among all created things. After this binding decree which hath descended from the heaven of the will of the Lord of eternity, all are obligated to obey. If they attain unto the divine commandments and act as befitteth, they shall be accepted before God. Otherwise the matter returneth unto itself and the heedless are in manifest loss.</p>
<p>In former Books, God hath called all servants His children, and this was due to the effulgence of the light of His mercy which encompassed all. Yet many of those children opposed Him, and every fair-minded person hath testified and doth testify to that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. What say they about Satan who, despite his lofty rank and station, was deprived of the realms of nearness and the presence of God? According to some he was the teacher of the Kingdom - yet what can be said of this station that was bestowed upon him, when in an instant he fell from the highest station in the Kingdom to the lowest realm of the material world, and was debarred and deprived of all grace? What can one say to Him Who doeth what He willeth? At one time he was worthy of grace and mercy, at another deserving of wrath and punishment.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the consort of the Apostle of God. That holy Being - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - said “Speak to me, O Humayra, speak!” This exalted word which issued forth from the Dayspring of the mouth of the Lord of all beings indicateth His supreme loving-kindness and compassion. Yet now the Shi’ih sect say concerning her that which all know. What was the cause of that acceptance, and what is the reason for this rejection by the Shi’ih sect? One of the bishops of Antioch said: “Why did your Prophet accept at first and make His intimate companion one who would ultimately be rejected?” Say: Ponder, O people, then judge with fairness concerning that which the Speaker of Sinai hath uttered when seated upon the throne of Manifestation, and be not of the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>One of the most distinguished of the Helpers, who was named Tu’mah, after the appearance of the Day-Star of Hijaz from the horizon of Yathrib, shared all he possessed with the Emigrants. Later, despite his evident nearness, there appeared from him that which made the very essence of truth to weep. After his rejected deed became known, he joined with the Jews. The Prophet was thoughtful and perplexed, for in the early stages of the Cause such matters cause disturbance and upheaval among the servants. At that hour Gabriel descended and recited this verse: “We have sent down unto thee the Book in truth, that thou mightest judge between men by that which God hath shown thee, and be not thou an advocate for those who betray their trust.”</p>
<p>In any case, let them refer to what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an. Concerning the creation of man He saith: “Yet are they in doubt about a new creation.” This moment is different from the moments before and after. Say: Reflect, that thou mayest take fairness as thy helper. Apart from these matters, two aspects exist in man - one directed toward God and one toward his own self. When the glance of grace beholdeth the first aspect, it mentioneth concerning him that which hath no equal in all creation. O Nightingale! Upon thee be My glory! Say: What sayest thou about Isma’il, the son of Ja’far the Truthful? This is the same Isma’il to whom the Isma’ilis adhere […]</p>
<p>Look at what has been mentioned about him that is beyond anything existing in the created world. O Nightingale, upon thee be My Glory! Say: What do you say regarding Ismail, son of Hadrat-i-Sadiq? This is the same Ismail to whom the Ismailis cling and adhere. His Holiness designated him as Imam and successor, and this decree was established. Later He removed him, which caused disturbance among the companions. Baghdadrah, who was among the most distinguished companions of His Holiness, asked whether it was possible for an Imam to be removed. In response, He said there was a change of divine will. The narrator of this tradition, Kulayni, and the objector Baghdadrah are both considered reliable by scholars of biographical evaluation. Say: Observe, that you may recognize what the Supreme Pen hath spoken in this mighty and wondrous station. Furthermore, it is clear and evident what the opposers and objectors have said in this regard. Among them were those who said: “If he was unworthy from the beginning, why was he appointed leader of the people? And if he was worthy, why was he removed? The station of Imam is that of guiding people in the first degree, and in your belief, His Holiness possesses knowledge of the first and the last. Therefore, such a matter which is contradictory and inconsistent should not appear from him.” In any case, these matters are mentioned in relation to the beliefs of that group, as every fair-minded one, every learned one, and every trustworthy truthful one beareth witness. In every age and century, some among the servants raised objections. After the Battle of Uhud, when the Bedouins of the surrounding areas went to congratulate the Quraysh, Sulafah, whose husband and sons were killed in battle, said to Sufyan that if anyone killed the murderer of her husband and children, she would give him a hundred camels. These words ignited the fire of greed and avarice in Sufyan. He sent seven Bedouins from Mecca who came to the presence of the Prophet and outwardly embraced Islam, saying “O Messenger of God, a group of us have attained to faith and acknowledge the oneness of God and thy prophethood. We request that thou command some of thy companions to come with us and teach us the divine laws regarding what is lawful and unlawful.” Among others, they asked for Asim. His Holiness chose ten from among the companions and commanded them to go among the tribes and teach the Quran and its laws. Asim and those with him set out for that region as commanded, and after their departure and arrival there occurred that which caused the greatest sorrow for the people of Yathrib. Some of the hypocrites arose in mockery, saying “Why did Muhammad’s God not inform him that this group had accepted Islam hypocritically?” And concerning what transpired, they judged His Holiness to be ignorant and lacking knowledge.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! The objector hath been and ever will be. In one instance that same person hath spoken the truth, inasmuch as the deeds of this group in the early days were, we seek refuge in God, truly such that no man could bear to mention them. However, concerning this Wronged One he hath not spoken with fairness, as thou and the manifestations of justice, equity and truthfulness can testify that this Wronged One, after arrival in Iraq by permission of His Majesty the Sultan, arose with complete determination, night and day, to educate souls and purify minds and hearts. Through God’s grace and loving-kindness, exalted be His glory, We strictly forbade conflict, corruption and contention in the Book, and commanded the servants to praiseworthy deeds and pleasing conduct. For nearly forty years, in no place hath the fire of war been kindled; rather, through the living waters of divine counsels and heavenly wisdom, tranquility and peace were established to the extent possible. We hope that henceforth no trace of corruption, conflict and contention shall remain in the world. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to unite their hearts and aid them to reform the souls of men and improve the countries. Verily, He hath power over all things. O Nightingale! Upon thee be My glory! Concerning the person mentioned, ask from God, exalted be His glory, whatsoever conduceth to the manifestation of justice and fairness. This Wronged One too asketh for him that which causeth return unto God. My God, my God! Aid Thy servants to perform such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of Thy acceptance, and to speak such words as are adorned with the glory of Thy good-pleasure, and enable them to manifest such character as will spread abroad the sweet savors of Thy days. Then ordain for them return unto Thee and repentance before the waves of the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent to do what Thou willest through Thy Will that prevaileth over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>That which those souls have uttered in response hath been adorned with the crown of acceptance. Every day objections have been raised by the heedless against His Holiness and His companions, yet God hath seized them through His power, and His Will hath effaced their traces through His sovereignty, and His Purpose hath taken hold of them with the grasp of One mighty and powerful. We have not mentioned some of these objections, for such matters are beyond reckoning. Were the eyes of the servants to be cleansed from the ophthalmia of desire and their hearts purified from the fire of hatred, they would witness that which they are deprived of today. Say: Know thou that We have commanded all to teach the Cause and have revealed regarding the conditions of teachers that which would enable every discerning one to recognize the bounty of this Revelation and its glory and generosity and favors and bestowals. It behooveth everyone who desireth to turn towards the Most Exalted Horizon to purify his outward and inward being from whatsoever hath been forbidden in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. And in the first step he must hold fast and act according to that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Furqan where He saith: “Say: ‘God’ then leave them to plunge in their idle diversions,” and to regard all else save God as but a handful of dust. Thus hath the light of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Will, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower. And in another step he must turn wholly towards the Divine Countenance and, with the tongue of the spirit and reality, advancing towards the Most Great House, arise and say: “I have abandoned the religion of a people who believe not in God and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter.” When a soul hath attained these two stations and these two commands, verily it hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen as being of the people of Baha in the Crimson Book. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen before the Divine Kaaba and acted according to that which hath been revealed in this time from the True Commander and Dayspring of Divine Revelation.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Upon thee rest My Glory! The radiant conditions for teachers shine forth like the sun from the horizons of the heavens of divine Tablets. Strange that until now they have not taken notice. The command to teach hath been sent down from the heaven of the Cause for all - that is, all are commanded to it. Likewise, concerning the conditions that have been mentioned, ask God to confirm all in that which is befitting. Some of the questioners who attend gatherings seek to learn of divine laws, while others merely mock and cast doubt in hearts. Verily thy Lord is with them, hearing and seeing all, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. And in one instance these exalted words were revealed: “It behooveth him who desireth to teach the Cause of his Lord to adorn his head with the crown of detachment and his temple with the robe of godliness.” And in another place: “It behooveth every teacher to ignore what he and others possess, fixing his gaze upon what is with God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.” This Wronged One hath repeatedly mentioned in these instances that which no fair-minded person hath rejected. By the life of God! Had a few souls acted according to what God intended, surely the lights of the traces of the Supreme Pen would have encompassed the world. From some souls who have attributed and do attribute themselves to the Truth, there hath appeared that which hath caused the greatest terror. We have said, and Our word is the truth: “The affliction is not My imprisonment, nor what hath befallen Me at the hands of Mine enemies, but rather from those who claim attachment to My Person yet commit that which causeth My heart and My Pen to lament, and every informed one and every discerning one to weep.” Time and again have such verses been sent down from the heaven of divine bounty, yet ears polluted with vain tales are deprived and forbidden from hearkening to these exalted and decisive words. If they would truly hearken to but one verse of the revealed verses, they would surely return from what they possess to what God possesseth, and would testify to the grace, bounty and justice of God, exalted be His glory, towards all. Concerning all, ye must beseech justice and fairness. Say: O my God, my God! Aid Thy servants to return unto Thee and to behold in the traces of Thy Supreme Pen with Thine eye. O Lord! Deny them not the ocean of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy bestowal, and keep them not away from Thy holy courts. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy Cause which, at its manifestation, effaced the traces of polytheism and hypocrisy, to transform the throne of ignorance into the seat of knowledge and wisdom, and the throne of tyranny and oppression into the chair of justice and fairness. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>In one passage this blessed verse was revealed, from which every hearing ear perceives the lamentation of this Wronged One: “Verily, Thou wert created for My help and the service of My Cause, yet thou didst aid Mine enemies through deeds more powerful than the hosts of kings and rulers.” In truth, today unseemly conduct from the people of God aids the enemies rather than the friends. O nightingale! We have manifested the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the treasuries of the Supreme Pen solely for those possessed of insight, that they might be drawn to the most exalted summit of justice and fairness. One must seek sight and hearing from God. That which had neither appeared before nor shall appear hereafter hath been made manifest in the world - to this beareth witness the Mother Book in the Kingdom of utterance. Blessed are they that hear, and blessed are they that attain! Thou hast seen and knowest these people - most are occupied with the buzzing of flies, deprived and forbidden from the cooing of the doves of the Most Exalted Paradise. Consider the deniers of the Cause, who soar on wings of idle fancies in the atmosphere of vain imaginings. Until now they remain unaware that the Lord they have chosen as creator is exactly like the Shi’ih sect, occupied with the fanciful traditions of the deluded ones, heedless and veiled from the reality of the Cause. The Word hath ever been cast by God; thereafter, deeds return to their doers - “whoso doeth good works it is for his own benefit, and whoso doeth evil, it is to his own loss.” Say: O servants of God! He hath come with the word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth,” and before this word the objections of the world are as naught. He saith: “Were He to decree the earth to be heaven, or heaven to be earth, none hath the right to question His authority.” Had there been ears to hear and eyes to see, that which would raise the earth above the heavens would have been revealed. But for those lost in fancy, the clear Book needeth not such ringing tones. Say: O ear of the world! Hear but this one word: The Primal Point - that is, the Herald, may my spirit be sacrificed for all else but Him - in answer to a question from one of the Letters of the Living, concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest, exalted be His glory and abundant be His grace, and may the spirit of all creation be sacrificed for Him, spoke these words, mighty be their remembrance: “If thou shouldst recite but one verse from the verses of Him Whom God shall make manifest, this would be more meritorious in the sight of God than if thou shouldst inscribe the entire Bayan, for on that Day that single verse would grant thee salvation, whereas the entire Bayan would not.” Now observe what station they have abandoned through vain imaginings and to what station they cling! Leave them to their idle fancies, leave them to their heedlessness, leave them to their vain imaginings, leave them to their idle conjectures wherein they disport themselves. There is no God but He, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>You have mentioned Akhtar, who has manifested such contention as hath no peer or likeness. Through unworthy means and vain desires he hath committed that which hath caused the reality of being to lament. You and all the friends know how that unrighteous one from Isfahan unjustly seized the property of the Afnan and other loved ones. He was so consumed by the fire of greed and passion that none save God can reckon its measure. In these days the government hath taken from him what he seized, yet until now it hath not reached its rightful owners. Let us see what will unfold hereafter and what fire greed and avarice will next ignite. In most of Our Tablets We have enjoined upon all trustworthiness, godliness, truthfulness and sincerity. Yet some have forsaken trustworthiness, chastity and truthfulness, clinging instead to treachery and calumnies in order to wrongfully devour people’s wealth. And some in this land have engaged in unseemly deeds. Purely to protect them We commanded them to depart, yet they committed what no heedless one hath ever done. Our purpose in their departure was protection and care, but it gave rise to enmity. We desired for them light and protection, while they desired for Us oppression and calumny. The cry of the oppressors is nothing but error. In any case, opposition and objection were not confined to the one from Isfahan and his companion. Haji Muhammad Karim Khan of Kirman wrote a book of refutation every year, as did other ignorant ones known as learned. And the author of Nasikhu’t-Tawarikh wrote concerning the Bab what no atheist hath ever written. We beseech God to aid His servants to observe with justice and fairness His signs and what hath appeared from Him. Should they achieve this blessing, all would proclaim the blessed words “I have abandoned the ways of a people who have turned away from Thee and who dispute with falsehood.” Verily aid is in His hand and confirmation in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. But the deeds of His servants have prevented them from beholding the waves of the ocean of utterance of the One desired by all the worlds. Eyes are barred from seeing and ears from hearing. God willing, they shall hereafter attain unto that which beseemeth them. Today deeds and character are supporters and helpers. You must adorn all with the ornament of goodly character and pure deeds, and remind them of justice and fairness. By God! The Wronged One, though in the dragon’s mouth, mentioneth them and counseleth them for the sake of God, desiring from them neither recompense nor aught else, even while seeing Himself in grave danger, for We have concealed nothing but have clearly enjoined upon all that which leadeth to their elevation and advancement.</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about the prisoners and the charity of some - praise be to God Who enabled them to perform a deed that hath attained the glory of His good-pleasure and been adorned with the ornament of His acceptance. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before their faces the gates of grace and bounty, to draw them nigh unto Him, and to assist them to champion His Cause through the hosts of wisdom and utterance, of deeds and character. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Dost thou see anyone who finds the sweetness of My utterance, or who dealeth justly concerning that which hath appeared from Me? And dost thou see anyone who soareth on the wings of detachment in this atmosphere? Say: O people, if ye deny this Most Great Cause, what matter is worthy of affirmation or capable of proof? Say: No obliteration can efface this proof, and this standing is sanctified above sitting or reclining - it was and is. And whatsoever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen shall assuredly be made manifest, and there shall remain not a single letter but the fair-minded shall behold it established upon the throne of revelation. Thy Lord knoweth and declareth, but most people know not.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst mention about the dissemination of Tablets and the spreading of the writings and the mention of the Most Great Branch - all were privileged to witness and hear this. Praise be to God Who hath confirmed thee in that which conduceth to the refinement of souls and the exaltation of God’s binding Word. The Most Great Branch hath recently turned his attention to its execution. We beseech God to confirm him in aiding His Cause, exalting His Word and elevating His servants, and to grant him success in purifying hearts and sanctifying souls. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the son of the late honored Mirza Aqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. Praise be to God, his thoughts are adorned with the maidens of praise and glorification, bedecked with eloquence and rhetoric. As he speaketh in praise of the Desired One of the righteous, he is mentioned before the Throne and illumined with the light of acceptance. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and through him to open the doors of hearts through His Name, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! Thou hast been mentioned by one who hath soared in My atmosphere and clung to My cord. We have remembered thee with a remembrance through which faces have turned toward the Lord of generosity and bounty. Give thanks and say: Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me and revealed unto me that which every letter thereof proclaimeth Thy tender mercy, Thy compassion, Thy grace and Thy bestowal. O my Lord! Thou seest me attracted by Thy verses and enkindled by the fire of Thy love. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast and firm in Thy Cause whereby hearts and minds have been shaken. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His tender mercy. Remember on My behalf thy mother. She hath attained unto My mention aforetime. Blessed is she. We testify that she hath attained unto a gem beyond compare and unto a pearl which God hath sanctified above all likeness and similitude, and these are My love, the mighty, the wondrous. Remember her on My behalf and give her the glad-tidings of My tender mercy and illumine her with the lights of the Day-Star of My knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! The souls mentioned in thy letter have attained unto remembrance. Praise be to God Who hath aided them to turn towards Him on a day wherein the fire of rejection was ablaze, and Who enabled them to hearken when most of mankind were debarred therefrom. Blessed are the hearts illumined by the light of recognition, and the faces that have turned towards the effulgent countenance of their Lord, the All-Merciful, and the eyes that have been solaced by the light of certitude, and the ears that have been privileged to hear the Call as it was raised betwixt earth and heaven. We beseech God to aid them to stand firm with supreme steadfastness in His Cause, the Most Mighty, the Most Exalted, the Most High, in such wise that neither the hosts of the earth and their ranks shall deter them, nor shall the clamor of the ignorant and their leaders frighten them. May He ordain for them a light that shall go before their faces in all His worlds. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Generous, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We have not mentioned their names, and this is a wisdom from Us, and I am the Ordainer, the All-Wise. The radiant light from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon them and upon those women who have believed and turned unto the All-Informed, whether they be men or women who are sincere, devout, mindful, or turned towards God. All are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One, and that honored one should gladden them with these supreme tidings.</p>
<p>As for him who hath mentioned the matter of the veil and the revelation of a Tablet concerning it, most are content merely to hear and cling to that which their souls and desires dictate. O Nightingale! Had they been observed to be sanctified from transgression and iniquity and adorned with righteousness and the fear of God, all would have been illumined by the manifestations of the lights of certitude, assurance and wealth. They have taken what is with the people and cast behind their backs what is with God as a recompense for their deeds.</p>
<p>Thou art witness and God doth testify that this Wronged One, after the rising of the Orb of the horizons from the horizon of Iraq, summoned the people of Iran to the horizon of the favor of the Lord of all worlds through two true messengers and spiritual heralds by night and by day. These two heralds were the pen and the inkwell. At all times the Kawthar of counsel flowed from the pen and the Salsabil of utterance appeared before all faces by His will. There was no purpose save the reformation of the world and the education of its peoples. In the early days of the Cause, deeds were observed to be so reprehensible that every person of insight would take refuge in God, and every hearing ear would, by night and by day, implore deliverance with humility and supplication, until through grace and favor, repugnant deeds were gradually transformed into goodly deeds and unacceptable conduct into acceptable behavior. Ask thou God to aid the people to recognize the purpose of this Wronged One, for should they become aware, they would themselves acknowledge that which they now deny. We ask for them success in all conditions. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>They made mention of the departed and exalted Hasan Khan, who ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon and Supreme Companion while in the prison of the opposers and deniers. Blessed is he and joy be unto him! By My life, he hath attained to that which none before him attained. The near ones now behold him in an exalted station. We were with him when he desired to attain the presence and meet Us, and We mentioned him in such wise that the ocean of forgiveness surged in all existence and the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds, was diffused. We revealed for him that which brought solace to the eyes of the mystics and We sent it to the Land of Ta. Verily, the mercy of thy Lord hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen. Woe unto those who recognized not his station and committed that which caused every fair-minded soul to lament and the tears of the lovers to flow. Will the oppressors endure, or will they find for themselves, at the time of reckoning, any escape or refuge? Nay, by My utterance, through which the realities of the Supreme Concourse, the Most Glorious Paradise, and the Highest Heaven were attracted! Say: My God, my God! Unite the hearts of Thy servants and cause them to know what Thou hast desired for them through Thy bounty. Were they to know, they would surely lament their own selves and weep for what hath escaped them in Thy days. O Lord! Leave them not to themselves, and withhold them not from drawing nigh unto the sun of Thy knowledge. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Then make the reward of those who transported him a treasure with Thee. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Trustworthy, the Guardian, the Helper, the Sustainer.</p>
<p>Mention of other souls who were with him hath been revealed and sent down in Tablets from the Divine Pen. Happy are they!</p>
<p>They made mention of the wife of Qasim Khan, upon her be the Glory of God. When We desired to make mention of her, We heard the call from the direction of grandeur and majesty of her arrival in the highest Paradise and her settlement in a chamber above whose door was inscribed: “This chamber hath been built for the people of Baha.” We beseech God to send down upon her at all times that which will comfort her eyes and gladden her heart. He is, verily, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Ye made mention of the mother and two sisters. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! The Wronged One, in the Most Great Prison, desireth to make mention of them in such wise that their names shall endure throughout the kingdom of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Blessed art thou, O my handmaiden and my leaf, in that God hath manifested through thee one who hath arisen to serve My Cause, to make mention of Me amongst My servants, and to praise Me amidst My creation. God, blessed and exalted be He, hath enabled him to spread His signs by whose light earth and heaven were illumined and hearts and minds were enlightened. We have ordained for thee a portion of his reward in teaching the Cause and manifesting the Word with wisdom and utterance. O Nightingale! Convey My glorification unto her and give her the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy which have preceded all things, and My light whereby existence hath been illumined.</p>
<p>And We make mention of thy sister at this time and give her the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the mighty throne. O My leaf! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn thee with the robe of recognition and illumine thee with the lights of certitude, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His handmaidens who circle round the throne. He is, verily, the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>And We make mention of My other handmaiden. Blessed is the ear that hath heard the call “O My handmaiden” and “O My servant,” and blessed is the heart that hath turned unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee and glorify the praise of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention of My handmaidens in all regions and give them glad tidings of what hath been ordained for them from God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Verily, she who hath attained unto acceptance is regarded by God as among the most exalted of men. Blessed are they, men and women, who have attained. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>You made mention of Ghulam-’Ali. O Ghulam-Qabli-’Ali! Canst thou hear My utterance with such steadfastness as to open thereby the ears of all creation? And canst thou speak with such utterance as to cause the tongues of the world to speak? Say: Nay, by thy life, except through Thy might and power. Unto God belong the treasuries of utterance. Were He to reveal but one verse therefrom, or manifest one pearl thereof, thou wouldst surely behold people intoxicated by the choice wine of God’s utterance, the Lord of all beings. Verily thy Lord is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. He who arose to serve My Cause and soared in the atmosphere of My love hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee with verses whose outer meaning is light and whose inner meaning is mercy, and within their innermost meaning is that which proclaimeth this momentous News. The glory rest upon thee and upon those whom the might of every heedless doubter hath not frightened.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! Those souls who have turned unto God and associated in love with thee, and who have accepted that which thou didst speak concerning this Most Great Cause, and likewise those handmaidens who have sought His good-pleasure and besought mention from the Lord of Remembrance - all have been blessed with the effulgences of the Sun of loving-kindness of the Desired One of the worlds. Today the ocean is surging, the sun is shining, and the light is radiant. Whosoever hath turned unto God and attained unto service to His loved ones is accounted among the people of Baha in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’, recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Convey My greetings and praise to the loved ones of that land, and likewise to the assured handmaidens who outwardly are veiled in names but inwardly are manifest and evident. In these days divine wisdom hath prevailed. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.</p>
<p>You made mention of Haji ’Ali and likewise of his turning toward the Most Holy Court. Divine ordinances and laws are each conditional upon the requirements of wisdom. Haji ’Ali, upon him be My glory, must observe that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. If it accordeth with movement, let him move, and if it accordeth with stillness, let him be still. Moreover, he must first determine the means of the journey, and thereafter proceed. The sale of property is not beloved in the sight of this Wronged One, save for the payment of debts. Many souls desired to sell their property for the payment of the Huququ’llah, but We forbade them.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! The greatest cause of this Wronged One’s tribulations hath been the gathering of people around Him. In the prison are assembled people of every kind. Now there are nearly three hundred souls, young and old, male and female. The rest is clear and evident. Some are firm as mountains and steadfast, some are like brilliant light, and others rise at times and fall at others. God dealeth with all with supreme loving-kindness. For twenty-one years have We dwelt in prison with this company. Say: Power belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Wisdom belongeth unto God, the Goal of them that know. Mercy belongeth unto God, the Object of worship of all in the heavens and the earth. Compassion belongeth unto God, the Lord of the first and the last. Jalal had permission to come, and as for the other two, after arriving in Port Said they sought permission and were not deprived of the ocean of grace. Verily thy Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>In brief, these are the conditions for those who have permission to visit: first, a sound constitution and healthy body; second, the means for travel including funds and other requirements. And the condition which is the greatest of conditions is to obtain permission in the place and station. Even if all else be present, if wisdom does not require it, movement and visitation is not permitted. God says: “Pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind,” and then He says: “for those who are able to make their way there.” We beseech God to aid all to perform that which they are commanded.</p>
<p>From the Dayspring of God’s Command naught appears save that which leads to the exaltation, elevation, love, fellowship and unity of His servants. He, verily, is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst mention about the eagerness of the servants and their enthusiasm, that each year a great multitude, inspired by the encouragement of the chavushes, intend to journey to the Most Exalted Horizon and the Supreme Summit - this is a cause for thanksgiving, for the penetrating influence of the Supreme Pen hath brought the servants to this station. Despite the opposition of all, it hath taken hold of the gems of existence through His absolute Will. This, notwithstanding that it hath appeared in days when ranks upon ranks, thousands upon thousands, cannons and swords were arrayed against it. Yet, detached from all else, We summoned all to that which conduceth to the upliftment of existence, the advancement of souls, the tranquility of servants and the development of countries.</p>
<p>This Revelation is the Revelation of the Most Great Mercy and Supreme Bounty, for it hath erased and forbidden the decree of holy war from the Book, and hath enjoined fellowship with the followers of all religions in a spirit of fragrance and joy. His honor hath witnessed what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in scriptures and tablets. Corruption, conflict and disputation have been forbidden. Likewise have We commanded the reading of the books of all peoples. All these matters are a great bounty for the servants, for previously they were forbidden and commanded to wage holy war. The wearing of foreign dress and the perusal of the books of other peoples were formerly forbidden, and traces of this prohibition can be found in the books. However, in this Most Great Revelation, the barrier of prohibition hath been lifted and freedom hath been granted and bestowed in its place.</p>
<p>God willing, may his honor be aided to conquer the cities of hearts with fragrance and joy, and be assisted in spreading the divine verses with wisdom and utterance. Verily, He will aid thee with the hosts of utterance. He, verily, is powerful over all things. We give thee glad tidings at this moment of the presence of that which was born of the maidens of thy thoughts and hath dawned from the horizon of thy sincerity, submissiveness and humility, and hath been read before all faces. We beseech God to grant thee a reward in every world of His worlds and to ordain for thee that which shall endure as long as His Kingdom shall endure. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Helper, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Convey to the loved ones in every place greetings and glory from the Wronged One, and illumine them with the lights of the Luminary of utterance of the All-Merciful. Thy work of reasoning hath attained the Most Holy Court. God willing, it shall be considered in these days. We beseech God to manifest for thee in His mention and praise that which shall attract the hearts. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Mighty, the Beloved. The light that shineth from the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Most Great Announcement and this Mighty Matter.</p>
<p>=== END BH00082 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00083 ===</p>
<p>Let the honored Shahid, son of Ismu’llah al-Asdaq, the beloved and esteemed Nabil-i-Akbar, upon him be all the most glorious Glory, take note:</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from all beginning and end, befitteth the threshold of nearness to the sanctified presence of the Beloved Eternal One, Who hath illumined the horizon of the heaven of man with the Luminary of knowledge. What regret and sorrow that while the company of the cherubim and those nigh unto God are singing praise, and the houris of the chambers of Paradise are chanting melodies, and the divine Cup-bearer standeth ready with the everlasting wine in His hand, yet there is no ear to partake of the first, nor any lip to attain unto the second. Glorified be He Who hath manifested Himself unto the unitarians among His servants and concealed Himself from the idolaters among His creatures. He is that sanctified Being Whom the tongues of the world are powerless to praise and the hearts of nations fall short of knowing. Through His complete power He hath made water appear from fire, and from fire He hath manifested light. The hand of His power hath seized the reins of the world, yet eyes are heedless of Him. His sovereign Will hath encompassed all things, yet the understanding of His servants falleth short. Blessed are they who have attained unto penetrating vision and have been adorned with new and hearing ears. These have drunk from the ocean of knowledge and have tasted of the fruits of the tree of insight. Such hearing and sight have ever been and shall ever be pure, transformed and illumined. Blessed are they who have become the object of that sight and the place of that hearing. Unto God belongeth all authority, from the past unto the future.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou at Whose separation the lamentations of those near unto Thee and the sincere ones have been raised, and at Whose remoteness the sighs of the unitarians and the successful ones have ascended, and the tears of the longing ones have fallen. I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, the lights of Thy countenance, the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance, and the mysteries of Thy Kingdom and Dominion, to aid Thy chosen ones to arise to serve Thee and to turn unto Thy realms. O my Lord! Thou seest those who have detached themselves from all else but Thee and have arisen to serve Thy Cause, and have chosen the hardships of exile in Thy love and pleasure, and the adversities of the world in hope of what lieth with Thee. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy grace to protect them from those who have striven to extinguish Thy light and have violated Thy covenant and Testament. Thou art He, O my God, before Whose manifestations of power the very essence of might hath bowed down, and the very embodiment of strength hath prostrated itself before the revelations of Thy strength. O Lord! Therefore send down upon him who hath arisen to serve Thee that which shall cause him to speak in such wise that silence shall not overtake him through what the hands of the wicked have wrought in Thy realm. I beseech Thee, O Beloved of hearts and Goal of all existence, to ordain for him from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall manifest him through Thy Name amongst Thy servants and shall exalt him through Thy favors amidst Thy creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. I pray, O my God, and offer peace upon him and upon those who have circled round for the exaltation of Thy Word and the revelation of Thy Cause. O Lord! Make them the lamps of Thy guidance and the standards of Thy victory. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate from His purpose. Thou hast ever been mighty to do what Thou willest and shalt ever continue to be even as Thou hast been from all eternity. There is none other God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>And then, O well-beloved of my heart! I had been slumbering when I was awakened by the breezes of your love that wafted from the traces of your pen and spread abroad from the realm of love that which my pen and tongue are powerless to describe. When I became aware and perceived this, I sought to ascend to that station whereon was established the throne of the King of Names. I attained unto His presence and presented myself, whereupon the Tongue of the Intended One spoke that whereby the realities of all things were attracted. He spoke, and His sweetest utterance is this: He is the Preserver, the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who turneth toward My Kingdom, who gazeth upon My horizon, who uttereth My praise in My days, and who standeth in service to My Cause! The servant here present hath received thy letter and laid it before the Wronged One as He walked in the place which God hath made the Most Great Scene of Vision. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. We have heard thy call and answered thee, and having perceived the fragrance of thy sincerity, We have sent thee that from which the perfume of My luminous robe is diffused. Blessed is the servant who hath been stirred by the raptures of thy words in remembrance of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. We have been with thee in all conditions and have revealed unto thee from My Most Exalted Pen that which shall endure as long as My most beautiful names endure. Rejoice thou in this manifest grace. God willing, My confirmations and the glances of My loving-kindness have been and shall ever be with thee. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God and give them all the glad-tidings of God’s grace and favor, exalted be His glory. God willing, may they be enabled to achieve that which befitteth this glorious and mighty Day. Blessed is he who hath arisen today to serve the Cause. Those who are endowed with utterance must occupy themselves with teaching. This is the imperative command of God which hath been revealed and sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in the Books and Tablets. This matter is most great. Beseech ye God, exalted be His glory, that He deprive not any soul of this lofty station. If from the beginning of the Cause, enkindled and assured souls had adhered to teaching, the world would now be illumined by the Most Great Light. It is hoped that the friends of God will all arise to teach the Cause with such arising as shall cause the people of the world to arise, with such utterance as shall cause the nations to speak. In the early dawn the gentle breezes of the All-Merciful’s loving-kindness waft over all, and the mysteries of union and meeting are revealed unto all things. Some attain unto hearing, while others are deprived. Each acteth according to his own way. By the Sun of utterance! Should any soul become aware of the greatness of this Day, neither the world of vanities, nor the world of all things, nor the world of books would hinder or deprive him. We have enjoined unity upon all. God willing, may all attain unto this station through the endeavors of His loved ones. O ’Ali! Say: There is no human being except through fairness, and no power except through unity, and no good or well-being except through consultation. O Muhammad! The Most Exalted Pen is occupied at all times. Beseech God that those who thirst in the wilderness of love be not deprived of this flowing Euphrates. Throughout the world this Remembrance hath been spread and its lights are manifest and evident; nevertheless the people of the earth remain veiled and heedless. Each of the various groups among this mighty community in the great cities holdeth fast to some matter and exerteth mighty efforts to promote it, to such extent that they withhold neither life nor wealth; yet the people of Persia remain heedless and veiled from this Most Great Cause which shineth like the sun at its meridian. Leave them to their vain imaginings. God willing, may the souls who are today associated with the Truth and remembered by His Name recognize and preserve their stations. Their station with God is great. Beseech ye God that He may strengthen all to preserve their stations in such wise that no matter among matters and no thing among things may hinder them or render them heedless.</p>
<p>O My beloved! The peoples of the earth are heedless of this most great bounty and supreme gift. With their own hands they carve out idols, and with the utmost diligence do they strengthen them, only to later lament their tyranny. The idol that hath been and is mentioned referreth to the ignorant one who, being known by the name of learning, hath in every age and dispensation been the cause and means of preventing the servants from attaining unto the outpourings of the Lord of creation, both in their beginning and their end. Should one possessed of insight ponder and examine the divine Books of former and latter times, he would testify to that which hath been mentioned.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning your proceeding, together with the beloved Haji Mirza Haydar-‘Ali, upon whom be 966 [Baha’u’llah], to the land of H.M. for the exaltation of God’s Word - this matter was presented before His presence. Thus did the Tongue of Revelation speak in this station. His exalted Word: God willing, may the saplings of the divine garden be adorned with fresh vestments through the water of His chosen ones’ utterance, and through the warmth of their love attain their ultimate growth and fruition. Verily, He is the Helper, the All-Wise, and the Bestower of success, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Assuredly, from directing oneself toward various regions for the manifestation of the Cause and the exaltation of the Word, purely for the sake of God, universal fruits have appeared and will continue to appear. Utterance in the path of the All-Merciful hath been and ever shall be effective.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the intention to proceed to the land of S. and its surroundings, in accordance with the previous directive - this matter is most praiseworthy. The duty of teaching is incumbent today upon such as that beloved one. According to the command, whosoever they deem suitable - that is, possessed of eloquence and a detached heart - should be sent to the divine cities and regions to purify souls with the Kawthar flowing from the Supreme Pen. This is beloved and acceptable in the presence of God.</p>
<p>All souls have been created for this Day. The beloved ones must strive their utmost in this matter. It is praiseworthy, nay obligatory, if souls would turn to the tribes - for instance, toward Kermanshah and likewise to the Bakhtiari regions around Fars and elsewhere - provided these souls are adorned with the ornament of revealed wisdom. Wherever they go, they must become the cause of the purification of souls, the reformation of the people, good deeds and virtuous conduct. It is hoped that through the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree, such a company will be found in the world who will illuminate the world with the light of wisdom. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Compassionate, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This is the Day of which Isaiah the Prophet gave tidings. The news of this Day hath dawned from the horizon of the divine Scriptures like the Greatest Luminary. All the Prophets have given the people of the world the glad-tidings of this Most Great Day, and all divine Books bear witness to this. But ignorance hath become a barrier and deprived people from the ocean of knowledge to such extent that they know not what is beneficial and what is harmful. The world hath been encompassed by calamity and darkness, yet none is aware. True indeed is our Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>If anyone were to observe with the eye of fairness and ponder upon the Tablets and Scriptures revealed in the past, he would testify to that which hath been made manifest. Word by word, it hath been sent down from the Kingdom of divine knowledge with perfect clarity. The people imagine that the learned ones, men of knowledge, wisdom, asceticism and piety are the divines of the earth, unaware that in the sight of God they are accounted among the ignorant. These heedless souls have been and continue to be the cause of the people’s heedlessness and their being barred from the Supreme Horizon. He saith: “The true scholar is he who hath guided the people to My path and taught them My straight way.” The scholar who attaineth unto this station is as the sight for the body of the world. His word, exalted be His glory: The wise and knowing one and the seeing scholar are as two eyes for the body of the world. God willing, may the earth not be deprived or forbidden these two supreme gifts.</p>
<p>As regards what you wrote concerning the fiery leaves and their dissemination, God is my witness that the same Mirza Hadi who is now engaged in misleading souls in the Land of Ta has never been and is not now aware of the Cause of the One to whom he claims allegiance. Would that the veil were rent asunder and he would, for God’s sake, attain in but a few moments to the hearing of words which, were they to be cast upon the hardest rock, would cause it to flow like running water. O company of the heedless! It is as though a blind man were to guide another blind man, or one heedless soul cleave to another. They speak according to their vain imaginings and perceive not. Would that they might succeed in at least turning to the holy writings. This evanescent servant is bewildered and amazed - to what do they cling and what do they say? Divine verses have encompassed the world to such extent that the horizons are filled with them. By God, besides Whom there is none other God, this servant and his like are powerless to reckon them, and all devoted souls bear witness to this. Nevertheless, the chief of calumniators has written that they take two words from here and two words from there and send them abroad. Observe how confident he is in the heedlessness, lack of understanding and blindness of his followers. Were he not confident, he would not utter such delirious statements whose falsity is clear as the sun. If one were to reflect even briefly for God’s sake upon the manifest conditions, he would become aware of how the first stirrings and origin of this Cause came to be. I beseech God to adorn the heedless with the ornament of awareness and to crown them with the diadem of fairness. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Muhammad-Taqi, let him be asked what he was told at the time of his departure - perchance he may remember or fear. For transient ornaments he turned away from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness and exchanged the Divine Joseph for paltry coins. In demonstrating his baseness, it suffices that Husayn-i-Sukhti prevented him from the truth and took him to the known island. How strange, how passing strange! And that person in Tehran who gave him the cloak - I swear by the Beauty of God that he too, like him, had absolutely no knowledge of the essence of this Cause. He and his two brothers were outside from the beginning and were unaware of the Cause of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - nay, they would repudiate it. Their house was in one quarter and the house of the Desired One in another, and due to their turning away there was separation between them for years, and most bear witness to this fact.</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about Haji Mirza H.S. - upon him be the glory of God - and the minister’s intention, these matters were presented before His presence. He said that what is necessary today is to hold fast to the work of teaching. If the exaltation of God’s Cause becomes somewhat manifest, all ministers will arise to assist, and whatever today becomes the cause and means of comfort and freedom is beloved. End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent one submits that consultation is necessary in all matters. That beloved one should greatly emphasize this point so that the practice of consultation may be established among all. Whatever has flowed and continues to flow from the Supreme Pen regarding this matter is intended to establish consultation among the friends, for it has been and will continue to be the cause and means of awareness, vigilance, welfare and safety.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the friends of God in every locality, God willing, may they be occupied at all times with their own betterment and that of the world, and be illumined and successful through the lights of His countenance. In truth, those souls who today have grasped the Most Great Law and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon are as commanders in the world. God willing, may they strive in these divine days to manifest that which shall never be erased from the ledger of the world, throughout the duration of the Kingdom of earth and heaven. Should they become aware of their stations, by the life of the Beloved, they would attain unto the most great joy. They have borne in the path of God that which none before them had ever borne. I beseech God to assist His loved ones to preserve their stations. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>That which hath been lauded from the lands of Kh, K, Q - blessed be they all! God willing, may they remain steadfast, firm and unwavering in this Most Great Cause with utmost dedication. Mention of them was made in the Most Holy Court. The Sun of loving-kindness hath dawned upon each one. I beseech God to increase, at every moment, the fire of their love and the light of their knowledge, in such wise that the circumstances of the oppressors shall not deter them from that which they are called upon to achieve. The tyrants and pharaohs, and their like, that have been mentioned in the past and present are, in the first instance, those ignorant ones who are known as divines among the common rabble. By God’s life! These are they who have barred the way of God, these are the veils that have intervened, and these are the false books. In truth, the divines of Persia are most heedless. That which hath been in the hands of that erring and misleading group hath largely been their own calumnies, which they have uttered in the past and present and recorded in their books. These are the scrolls of vain imaginings, the registers of idle fancies, and the proclamations which they have falsely attributed to the Sacred Precinct.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion this evanescent one sought the most exalted goal and the loftiest summit. After attaining the most holy and glorious presence, He said: “O servant who standeth here! Tell Me, from what mine did the bullet come, and of what substance was it made, that martyred the Primal Point, the Herald of the Most Great Beauty? And of what metal and from what mine came the swords that cut the bodies of the loved ones to pieces? O servant who standeth before the Countenance! Ponder the words of the Wronged One of the horizons, that perchance through thy pondering there might appear in the peoples of the earth such power that all may reflect, with complete understanding, upon that which hath come to pass.” At that moment, the rays of the light of the All-Merciful’s utterance so overwhelmed this evanescent one that he was, and shall ever be, powerless to describe it. For some time this servant remained standing while the Ancient Beauty remained silent. At last He said: “O servant! That iron and that bullet which caused the lamentation of those near unto God and the crying out of the sincere ones - these were the words of the heedless souls who had been raised up in the mines of ignorance and falsehood, and which ultimately issued from the mouths of the divines and martyred that Essence of being and His loved ones. O servant! Reflect carefully - were it not for the mention of Jabulqa and Jabulsa, and the Sacred Precinct, and the existence of the Qa’im with his described attributes, that which came to pass would not have occurred, and that which the pen and tongue tremble to recount would not have been witnessed.” He said: “O servant who standeth here! If a person were to observe with justice, that very word which issued from the mine of falsehood stating that His Holiness existed and claiming His birth from unbelievers was as the bullet that struck the body of that Lord of the worlds. And now the deniers of the Bayan follow the same path and are occupied with arranging the same vain imaginings.”</p>
<p>Here endeth His utterance. May God protect us and all mankind from their deceit and calumnies and from that which issueth from their mouths. Verily He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Powerful. Can no ear be found? Hath the faculty of sight been obliterated? To what realm hath justice journeyed, or hath truthfulness expired? This inadequate ignorant one knoweth not what to say. These matters transcend mention and utterance. Sighs ascend and tears fall, and the matter is in God’s hands, the Lord of the one who remembereth and speaketh.</p>
<p>The honorable amah (handmaiden) of God who had petitioned the True One, glorified be His majesty, seeking grace for her husband - this matter was presented before the Presence of the Lord of all creation. These are the words that the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in response, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O Ali, O thou who standest to serve Me! O Muhammad, O thou who gazest toward My horizon and hast turned thy face unto My countenance! Hearken unto My call and give her these glad-tidings from Me - that she should read what hath been revealed by My Most Exalted Pen in this noble station:</p>
<p>‘Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose name the ocean of generosity hath surged and the fragrance of grace hath wafted amidst the peoples! I beseech Thee by Thy most sweet call and by the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in this world and the world to come. Then write down for Thy servant that which shall draw him nigh unto Thee, shall make him recognize Thy Manifestation, Thy Revelation and Thy sovereignty, and shall teach him that of which he was heedless in Thy days. O Lord! Thy grace hath preceded and Thy mercy hath encompassed all things. I beseech Thee by the sovereignty of the Names not to deny him and me access to the ocean of Thy bounty, the heaven of Thy grace and the sun of Thy bestowals. O Lord! We know not what profiteth us - Thou art more knowing of us than we are of ourselves. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.’”</p>
<p>Observe how the grace of God, exalted be His glory, hath reached such heights that every fair-minded soul hath acknowledged and confessed that it hath no likeness or peer. God willing, may all who dwell on earth be assisted to turn toward the gate of His bounty and may they never be disappointed. Let that which hath been revealed in this station be conveyed to the handmaiden of God, upon her be the glory of God.</p>
<p>As for the mention that was made of the relatives of the departed and elevated Ismu’llah al-Asdaq, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - this was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court. He said that the gaze of His grace had been and would continue to be fixed upon them. Convey to all of them greetings from God. Their mention hath been revealed in God’s Book both before and after, and holy Tablets were previously sent to them. Remember them all with wondrous and sublime remembrances from God that shall cause joy and delight. Verily We hear and see them. God willing, that which hath been ordained for them shall be made manifest. Verily He unfoldeth a matter from His presence and He is the Powerful, the Munificent, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the honored nobleman Haji Munshi Haqiqi, upon him be the glory and might of God - truly it is exactly as that beloved one hath written. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Exalted True One to increase his enthusiasm, joy and love at all times. His mention hath been and continueth to be made in the Most Holy Court, and this evanescent one shall compose and send a letter in response to his missive.</p>
<p>And again in another letter you mentioned His Excellency the Minister. He and his party have striven and continue to strive for prosperity and complete freedom. When the rays of the Light of Revelation were manifest from the horizon of Zowra (Baghdad), the Consul who was in Iraq came with utmost love into His presence, and whatever matter was mentioned to him, he would immediately arise to execute it. The Blessed Beauty also went to his home one day, and that was indeed a memorable day. He received and accompanied Him with such warmth that it caused astonishment to some. And at the time of departure from that land, they sent Jinab-i-Mirza Mehdi Huzur, who was the Embassy secretary, and after attaining the Most Holy Presence, he conveyed: “His Excellency sends his greetings and says if you would turn towards our direction, transport is ready, and if there is any matter, write it down and I will send it to Her Majesty the Queen and will quickly bring back the response.” He (Baha’u’llah) said: “Truly, We derive the utmost joy from the love of His Excellency and his government. However, now, in response to the request of the Governor and ministers of the Sublime State, We are proceeding in that direction. The Command is in God’s hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. On Our behalf, convey Our greetings to His Excellency and say We are most grateful for your kindnesses, and We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to bestow upon your illustrious government the reward for this righteous deed.” This deed of his has been and will remain foremost among all deeds that have been manifested from the beginning of the emergence of that illustrious government until now, for the mention of this episode will endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. God willing, may they be assisted today to accomplish that which will cause their exaltation, elevation, and remembrance to endure as long as God’s names and attributes endure.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God. It was presented before His countenance, and this is what the Kingdom of Utterance spoke forth, exalted be His grandeur: “O Ibrahim! Great is this Day and mighty this Cause. Whosoever today has drunk from the ocean of certitude and found his way to the Supreme Horizon is reckoned among the most distinguished of souls in the presence of God. Blessed is the eye that has been illumined by the lights of His countenance, and blessed is the ear that has hearkened to the call of the Wronged One. Today, after recognizing the Dawning Place of God’s Cause and the Source of His Revelation, steadfastness is the greatest of all deeds. Whosoever attains unto it has attained unto the most exalted summit. God willing, through His grace you shall attain this most great station and preserve it through the Name of Truth. Blessed is he who gave you to drink and taught you that which was hidden from all save whom God, the Lord of all worlds, willed.”</p>
<p>For those souls whose mention has flowed from the pen of that beloved one, the infinite bounties of God, exalted be His glory, are manifest and evident. God willing, may all drink from the cup of grace and be thankful, praising, joyous, and glad through His favor and mercy. Verily, this servant prays for them in all conditions, and our Lord, the All-Merciful, is indeed the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Let another Tablet of that Exalted One which thou didst send dated the 20th of Safar, and from which the fragrance of the soul was diffused, for it was adorned with the ornament of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. Praise be to God that the glad-tidings of the spiritual herald arrive continuously - His is the praise, the gratitude and the glory morning and evening. And when this evanescent servant was warmed by the heat of love and became intoxicated from the cup of remembrance and utterance, he aimed for the supreme height and ultimate goal and presented the levels before His face. This is what the tongue of our Purpose and your Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and earth hath spoken, His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O thou who rememberest Me and gazeth upon Me and circleth around My Cause! By My life, should the breeze from the rose-garden of the utterance of the All-Merciful pass over decayed bones, verily from its rustling they would attain unto the station of ‘then We clothed the bones with flesh, so blessed be God, the best of creators.’ Yet it hath passed over heedless souls and no trace appeared from it, for they have drunk from the breast of idle fancies and are deprived and forbidden from the ocean of certitude. They never possessed sight or hearing in any way. A few ignorant ones have seized the reins of those souls and lead them wherever they desire. Their vain imaginations move them - verily they are in manifest loss. But ere long they shall witness the fruits of their deeds and shall utter ‘Would that we were dust!’</p>
<p>“Convey My greetings to the friends of God who have drunk from the wine of unity and are enkindled with the fire of love, that perchance from the fragrance of that greeting they may attain unto a new life and may be observed steadfast and firm and upright in the Cause of the Lord of creation with perfect unity. The glory be upon thee and upon those whom God hath related to My Most Truthful Name. Upon him be My glory and My loving-kindness and My mercy and My tenderness. Say: Be not grieved by the conditions of the world and its hardships. God willing, that which is the cause and reason for the joy and gladness of those who are near, the unitarians, and the sincere ones shall appear.”</p>
<p>The effulgences of the Sun of bounty are of such magnitude that a hundred thousand like this servant are powerless to describe them. That honored one himself hath attained His presence and witnessed the waves of the Most Great Ocean, therefore he hath no need of mention by this evanescent one.</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst write about the honored mother and sister, upon them be the glory of God, who reside in Ta, loving-kindness hath been and is being shown to them, and this evanescent one beareth witness to this matter. Nevertheless, details were submitted and attained the honor of being heard by the Beloved of the worlds. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O handmaiden of God! Thy mention hath flowed from the Pen of the Divine Unity repeatedly in various times, and that which thou hast attained unto, the queens of the earth have not attained. Thou hearest from the tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory, the word ‘O My handmaiden.’ By Him Who hath subjected the heavens and earth by a word from His presence, the pearls and precious gems of the earth cannot equal this word. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and be assured by My loving-kindness. The assured, steadfast, firm handmaidens are accounted as leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree and are mentioned in the Book as handmaidens and are related to the Truth. What station is greater than this? God willing, may ye hold fast unto that which God loveth and gaze toward the direction of the Prison. We convey greetings to all the handmaidens of that land and give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, tenderness and generosity. The glory be upon thee and upon thy daughter and upon them.”</p>
<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned unto My most exalted horizon, who hath heard the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, and who hath answered the Lord of Names, Who came with a sovereignty that encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, and by Whose command all necks were humbled. O Muhammad! Dost thou know Who maketh mention of thee in the prison? By the life of God! He Who conversed with God on Sinai maketh mention of thee, and the Lord of all being hath turned toward thee - He through Whom the Trump was sounded and the path of God, the Lord of Lords, was established. Wert thou to become aware of My loving-kindness and to discover the fragrance of My raiment, thou wouldst arise to make mention of Me and to praise Me in such wise that the affairs of earth and its colors would not hinder thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld My most great signs, the ear that hath heard My sweetest call, the face that hath turned toward My most exalted horizon, and the hand that hath been occupied in transcribing that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of its Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and having witnessed thy turning unto Us, We make mention of thee in this Tablet which shall endure as long as My names endure in My Kingdom. Verily thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Mighty, the Bountiful. We entered the Prison and summoned all unto the Most Great Ocean. Among men are those who have broken the Covenant of God and His pledge, and among them are those who have said: “Here am I, here am I, O Revealer of verses!” We have made mention of everyone who hath turned unto the Countenance. My Pen and My Tongue bear witness to this, and beyond them My knowledge which encompasseth the horizons. When thou art favored with this Tablet and hearest what hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s will, turn thy face toward My direction and say: “I testify that through Thee the verses have been sent down, the signs have appeared, and that which was hidden and treasured from time immemorial hath been revealed. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the wonders of Thy bounty, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things!” Thus have We sent down unto thee from the river of My mercy that which God hath made the cause of life for all who are in the earths and heavens. We have forgiven her whose forgiveness thou didst seek. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. The Glory rest upon thee and upon her and upon those who have cast away the world and turned unto the Most Great Name, Which uttereth in every condition that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad Qadi, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet specifically for him has been revealed from the heaven of God’s will and sent. God willing, he will attain unto it and drink from the ocean of inner meanings. Likewise, nine exalted Tablets without names - corresponding to the Greatest Name - were sent to be delivered to the individuals listed in the sheet of names. Their names were not written, in wisdom for the Cause. The unnamed Holy Tablets should be distributed thus: that beloved one should first engage in divine remembrance to the number of the Greatest Name, then perform ablutions, then again engage in the first remembrance, and place the Tablets in an elevated location covered with a fine cloth. Then, intending any name, reach in and withdraw one Tablet, write that name on it and give it. God willing, Holy Tablets will continue to be sent in this manner hereafter. Sending them all at once is not permitted. This evanescent servant beseeches God - exalted be His glory - that through that beloved one’s being, the unconscious temples may become conscious and arise to serve God.</p>
<p>Mention was made of turning toward the land of Kha. Convey greetings to all the friends in that land as commanded. In these days, specifically for those whose petitions reached the Most Holy Court, and likewise some correspondence that was sent to His Eminence the Elevated One of the people of Qa’in - upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God - replies to some have been revealed and sent, that their eyes may be gladdened, their faces illumined, and tranquility may come to the hearts of those who hastened to God’s path, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>An event that has occurred in these days in the Most Great Prison is the ascension of His Eminence Nabil-i-Qabli-’Ali from the people of Qa’in - upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God and all His most luminous Light. He ascended to the Supreme Companion at dawn on Wednesday the 20th of Rabi’u’l-Avval. By command, the Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - as well as the two most luminous Branches - may my spirit be sacrificed for them both - who were present in the palace were ordered to accompany the funeral procession and went on foot. The Most Great Branch of God - may my spirit, being and essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - was present in the prison land and was present that night and morning with him who ascended to God. This servant also sought permission to attend the funeral procession but was told: “Your attendance is not permitted as the weather is cold and signs of weakness are observed in you.”</p>
<p>Afterwards this evanescent one was present before the Most Holy Presence with papers, pen and ink. That same day there was revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for that elevated deceased one that whose fragrance will endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure and whose mention will flow from the tongues of the people of the world. The bounty, favor, kindness and mercy of God are at such a degree that all the world is incapable and falls short of comprehending it as it should be. Convey greetings from this evanescent one to the friends of God. God willing, may they attain to that which is loved by God and inscribed in the Book. The Glory be upon your honor and upon them and upon those who have drunk the Kawthar of recognition from the hands of their Lord’s bounty, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>29 Jamadi’u’l-Avval 1299</p>
<p>=== END BH00083 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00084 ===</p>
<p>This is the Surih of Command which We have sent down by Our command and authority from before Us, and verily I am the Commander, the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the Powerful, the Dominant, the Self-Subsisting. He is the Invincible Sovereign, the Single One, the Victorious, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who created all creation by His command, and brought every created thing into being nearer than can be counted, were ye to know. He shall create as He willeth through His power, and none can prevent Him from His purpose, for He is the True One, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. He hath sent down all things in the Book and perfected the creation of all things in due measure, that men might be assured of His signs. He shall continue to send down the command of all things in the Book, were ye to perceive. His signs shall not be severed, nor His proof exhausted, nor His testimony weakened, nor His sovereignty perish, for He is verily the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.</p>
<p>He it is Who sent down the Book wherein He hath detailed all that ye know not, and He shall continue to expound the truth and send down the Command as He willeth, were ye to understand. He hath taught all things the measures of knowledge according to their capacity, were ye to know, and He shall continue to teach His servants from the wonders of knowledge, for He is verily the Sovereign, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>Say: He it is Who hath lit for you the Lamp of Holiness that ye might be illumined thereby in the darkness of your own selves, and that ye might not go astray. And He shall cause the Lamp of the Spirit to shine in the Niche of the Command, were ye to witness it. He it is Who kindled the Fire of the Command in the Blessed Vale, the holy and blessed spot, and He shall kindle it through His grace in the innovative Paran, that ye might be guided by God’s guidance.</p>
<p>The Sun of Wisdom and Utterance hath shone forth upon you, were ye to behold with the eye of God. He shall cause it to shine forth when He willeth and desireth. There is no God but Him, the Supreme, the Holy. None can prevent Him from exercising His sovereignty. He ruleth as He pleaseth by His command, were ye to believe. He shall perfect His Cause through His power, even should all who are in the heavens oppose Him, and this is a known truth. He shall aid His servants with the means of the heavens and earth until His Cause is established, His sovereignty exalted, and His power made manifest. Thus hath He prescribed for Himself in the preserved Tablets of Glory.</p>
<p>Say: The power of God is like unto an ocean - would it diminish by the drawing of cups? Say: What aileth you? How do ye judge? Say: The knowledge of God is like unto the winds - would they cease to blow? What aileth you, O heedless ones? How do ye imagine?</p>
<p>Say: Verily His Cause is sanctified above all similitudes, even as His Essence is sanctified above all that ye can comprehend. Yet He citeth similitudes that ye might understand God’s Cause, and that ye might find the sweet fragrances of holiness from the Ridvan and from the holy and hidden direction, and that your souls might thereby find rest and be not troubled, and that ye might not deny God’s grace, nor forget His covenant, nor be of those who are not guided by God’s guidance. And that ye might distinguish between truth and falsehood, then unto God shall ye return.</p>
<p>Say: Those who deny God’s grace, their punishment shall soon overtake them, and ye shall then witness it. Deny not the signs of God when they are sent down unto you, and turn not back on your heels, and be not of those who were turned back. Verily the influence of God shineth like the sun among the stars, were ye to perceive. None shall doubt God’s proof and His Cause save those who doubt their own selves and who deny God’s favor.</p>
<p>Say: O people, have mercy upon yourselves and be not neglectful of God’s Cause, then deny not the signs of God. The kingdom and all that ye occupy yourselves with shall perish, then unto God your Lord shall ye be gathered. Look ye unto the peoples of the past, then ponder their fate. Did their opposition or denial endure in the earth?</p>
<p>And that which ye have busied yourselves with, then unto God your Lord shall ye be gathered. Consider the peoples of old, then ponder their affair. Did their opposition and denial remain on earth, and all that they were wont to do? When the Messengers of God came unto them, they but opposed them until they imprisoned and slew them, as ye well know. Yet God exalted their Cause and established their proof, and cut off the last remnant of those who opposed God and denied His signs. Soon shall ye find these who have waxed proud against God like unto the peoples of old, and God shall seize them for their unbelief and return them to their abode in the fire of their own selves, wherein they shall be tormented for all eternity. Say: O people, fear ye God and follow not your desires, but follow the Command of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Transgress not what hath been detailed in the Book, exceed not His bounds, and be not heedless of His remembrance. Beware lest ye forget God’s laws and all that ye have been commanded in the Book - this is better for you, did ye but know. Trust not in your wealth and children, but put your trust in God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Follow God’s decree concerning your own selves, then turn your faces toward His countenance. Thus do We reveal unto you from the verses of the Command and teach you the ways of holiness, that haply ye may understand. Say: If ye act not in accordance with what hath been decreed in truth from the presence of a Wise, Self-Subsisting Lord, God will surely create another creation who will all act according to His command and prostrate themselves before Him. Say: He is indeed independent of all who are in the heavens and the earth, and of all that ye know or recognize. Say: These are the paths of truth which We have made manifest in truth, if ye desire to walk therein. Walk ye then therein by God’s leave, and tarry not for less than an instant if ye be of them that believe. Follow not those who have wronged their own souls and wronged others, who were among the corrupt in the Holy Land. They say “We believed in Ali aforetime,” yet now they deny His signs. They imagine they believed in God in His former Manifestations, yet today they disbelieve in His sovereignty. Thus doth God reveal the deeds of those in whose hearts lurked rancor toward the Cause, though they sought to conceal it. Thus doth God render void the false through its own deeds and establish the truth through His words, if ye would know it. Say: We desire naught save what God hath desired for Us - this is My desire in the hereafter and in this world, as beareth witness the angels that circle round the Throne. We wished only what God wished for Us, and We rejoice therein at all times, if ye but knew. Say: Days have passed over Us which none knoweth how they passed save God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beloved. And days pass over Us in these times which none knoweth how they pass save God, the Single, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. We have been grateful for all that hath befallen Us, content with what He hath decreed for Us. We are patient in His trials and complain of nothing except to Him. We follow in all matters His chosen ones who were patient in tribulation, and We are patient even as patient servants aforetime who were honored and whom God raised up in truth over all who are in the heavens […]</p>
<p>God raised them up in truth over all who are in the heavens and the earth, and they summoned the people until they were slain in the path of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. And the more they increased in remembrance, the more the people increased in their wretchedness, and they answered not God’s herald in their midst, and they were of those who denied the presence of God. Thus do We recount unto you from God’s ways which were decreed upon His servants, that ye may know what hath befallen His chosen ones in this time, that perchance ye may ponder within yourselves and deny not God’s signs in your days, and follow not Satan in your souls. Then be ye guided by God’s lights, the King, the Mighty, the Holy.</p>
<p>He it is Who sent down the Bayan in truth, and verily We believe in it. He hath brought forth the creation of the heavens and earth by His command and perfected the creation of all things. This is what hath been ordained by the Pen of Creation upon preserved holy tablets. There is no God but Him - His is the creation and the command, and all return unto Him. He hath ordained the measures of all things, as ye witness in the Book. Therein He opened the gates of Paradise, and in each gate dwelleth a creation. And He planted in every Paradise lofty and noble trees, all of which have borne holy fruits whereof the righteous partake in bliss.</p>
<p>And He established in each one thereof palaces of hidden and precious pearls, and in every palace are maidens who appear to have been created from the light of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Beloved. They all remember God their Creator with enchanting and uplifted melodies, and the people of the eternal pavilion take delight in their songs and are drawn by their strains.</p>
<p>And in every Paradise flow seven rivers that ye may drink therefrom. Among them floweth the wine of immortality on the right hand of Paradise, like liquid rubies of holiness. And among them is the milk of glory whose color never changeth throughout the dominion’s duration, if ye be of those who are certain. And among them is purified honey whose taste altereth not, and none shall partake thereof save those who have trusted in God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. And among them is water that never stagnates, wherein man findeth every delight - this is what hath been ordained therein of God’s grace, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Holy.</p>
<p>And among them is a river that floweth by the name of the Beloved, and the people of Paradise at all times beseech their Lord God to be given a drink therefrom - this is what they seek from God morning and evening. And among them is a river that floweth in the form of trinity within the word of quaternity, and it maketh mention of God in its flowing, if ye would understand. The people of Paradise gather around it to hear what is mentioned of the remembrance of God, the Triumphant, the Mighty. Whoso drinketh a drop thereof shall attain unto his desire and reach a station whereunto none can arrive save whom God willeth and desireth. Thus do We cast upon you the wonders of God’s handiwork, that perchance ye may hasten unto Him.</p>
<p>And among them is a river which God hath sanctified from every color and purified from every taste, for it was created from the pure essence of God’s nature, if ye but knew. Therein He hath ordained that which cannot be described in words nor completed by the pen, if ye be of those who are certain. Whoso drinketh a draught therefrom, the mystery of what was and what shall be is manifested unto him, and he knoweth all things in their places […]</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! Follow not your selfish desires, nor deprive yourselves of these breezes that waft from the direction of eternity at the right hand of Paradise. Turn your hearts to this holy and beloved quarter. Take not your desires for your god, nor be of those who cleave to the idols of their vain imaginings. Shatter the idols by the power of the Name of God - this, indeed, through His Most Great Name, if ye be endowed with vision. Say: The breezes of bounty have wafted, and the clouds of grace have been raised up, and all things have been adorned since the Temple of Light hath been established upon the cloud of holy and inaccessible glory. Know ye then the value of this transcendent, exalted, and sublime bounty. At that time, the Herald of Immortality shall call out to all who are in the heavens and on earth, and shall give glad tidings of the meeting with God to all things, if ye but hearken. O heaven of holiness! Adorn thyself with the stars of glory, then ascend as thou willest, for thou hast attained unto these days wherein none of the near ones have attained save those whom divine benevolence preceded in this Cause and whom the breaths of hidden glory have encompassed. O cloud of the Cause! Rain down from the pearls of holiness as thou willest, and turn not to anyone, that all things may partake of thy bounty, for upon thee hath been established the Beauty of God, the Sovereign, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. O land of Paradise! Rejoice within thyself, then give glad tidings within thine essence, for the footsteps of the Spirit have walked upon thee, and this is a manifest bounty. Then reveal the mysteries treasured within thee, for this is the Day whereon the near ones shall be gathered. For besides these, none have a portion of this gathering wherein the Words of God shall be manifested in their fullness - these are indeed His words, would ye but read them. And this is the gathering of the Spirit wherein holy souls are gathered, and besides them none can approach even by a finger’s breadth. This is a station wherein the Buraq moveth not, nor can the celestial pavilion ascend thereto, if ye but knew. O gardens of earth! Adorn yourselves with the roses of holy love, then manifest all that hath been treasured within you of holy subtleties and sweet-scented breezes. O trees of earth! Arise by God’s leave, then bring forth holy fruits according to what hath been ordained in you by God’s command, the Holy, the Exalted, the Self-Subsisting, for the winds of eternity have blown upon you from this quarter wherein every beloved matter hath appeared. O birds of Paradise! Sing and warble the sweetest melodies, then soar in this atmosphere, for We have created you in the name of one of the Names, that by these melodies may be attracted the hearts of those who have detached themselves from all directions and turned unto a praiseworthy station of nearness. All this is from the grace of Him Who hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, whereat rejoice the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and beyond them the inhabitants of the pavilions of immortality - and now, O people of earth, be ye joyful! And thou, O quarter of Iraq! Weep with thy heart and thine eyes, for the Beauty of God hath departed from thee and established Himself in the prison, behind the peaks of towering mountains. Strip from thy frame the garment of joy, for the breezes of glory have been cut off from this hidden Pearl. By God! The eyes of eternity weep for thee, and the hearts of the people of Paradise bleed for what hath befallen Us at the hands of the embodiments of detested oppression. O thou quarter! How canst thou remain in thy place when thou witnesseth God’s station in manifest sorrow? Dost thou behold the City of God after the gems of the Cause have departed from it? […]</p>
<p>O Iraq! Let your heart weep, and then your eyes, for the departure from you of the Beauty of God, Who is now confined in a prison-fortress behind towering rocky mountains. Cast off from your form the garment of joy, for the breezes of glory have been cut off from this Hidden Pearl. By God! The eyes of eternity weep for you, and the hearts of the denizens of Paradise are rent by what hath befallen Us at the hands of the embodiments of despised tyranny. O land! How canst thou remain in thy place when thou beholdest the Seat of God in manifest sorrow? Canst thou witness the City of God after the departure therefrom of the Essences of His Cause, who are now imprisoned in a distant land beyond Qaf? O City! How canst thou remain steadfast in thy position and harbor the bodies of those who have denied and associated partners with God, after the departure from thee of the Temple of God with His few companions? The heavens are well nigh rent asunder, and the holy earth split open, by reason of the tears of the Youth falling upon this Face that hath turned only unto God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. The atoms of all created things weep at His weeping, and the Countenances of Paradise lament in chambers of crimson ruby. Hear thou the lamentations of the dwellers of the heavens, if ye be of them that hear. We remain in a place where the hands of all created things are cut off from Our robe, where no cry can reach Us, nor the wailing of those who doubt the meeting with their Lord. Yet We are patient in all things, and My patience is only through God, and in Him let the detached ones place their trust.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! We ask nothing of you save fairness. Be fair in all matters and dispute not the verses of God after they have been sent down in truth. Be not of those who look not upon the Beauty of Holiness, who shut their eyes to the Truth, follow their own desires, and wax proud before God while they perceive it not. When the verses of God are sent down to them, they persist in pride, then turn back on their heels, opposing God at every moment while they understand not. Say: Did not God create you through the breath of the Ancient Pen into your spirits? This is from the Pen of God, if ye would but judge fairly within yourselves.</p>
<p>O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and forge not lies against Me as ye did aforetime. Take not vain pleasures as your protector instead of God, and sport not with His verses in your presence. Compare not the Self of God with your own selves, nor His verses with your words, if ye would observe with the eye of God in His Cause. Speak not of God’s Cause that which befits not your station, and transgress not your bounds. This is the best counsel, if ye would be fair unto yourselves. Purify your souls and your spirits, and bear not earthly burdens upon your bodies and hearts, that ye may perchance be enabled to soar in the atmosphere of nearness and then enter the holy expanse. Beware of looking toward the world and those from whom ye detect the odor of faithlessness, that your eyes may fall upon pure Beauty and ye may enter the pavilions of glory. Say: God hath numbered among you servants who acknowledge God’s grace and recite the words of the Bayan, who enjoin justice upon men and who at all times speak forth the verses of God. But he who hath been given the eye of knowledge by God witnesseth their hearts to be contrary to what their tongues proclaim, and perceiveth from them the fragrance of malice […]</p>
<p>And from them He perceives the stench of rancor and hypocrisy. This is what was sent down at that time from the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. However, We have veiled their names in the Book, that perchance they may become aware within themselves. O people of the Bayan! Draw not nigh unto them, neither accept their words, if ye desire to hear God’s decree within yourselves and then unto Him return. Say: When Satan desires to lead astray any of God’s servants, he appears in his form and acts as he acts and makes mention of whatsoever he mentions concerning God, the Most High, the Exalted, the Supreme, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, and remains in that state until he occupies his heart and diverts him from what he intended. Then he flees from him and disavows him. Thus do We set forth every similitude for you lest ye go astray. Beware lest ye forget God’s favor unto you and the time He was among you, bestowing upon you daily the gems of knowledge and wisdom, and causing the lights of hidden glory to shine upon your hearts and spirits. Forget not the time when the Countenance of God walked among you, illumining with His beauty the hearts of those who were turned toward His beauty. Remember at every moment those days when the Nightingale of Eternity soared among you and sang unto you holy melodies while ye were ever listening. Would ye occupy yourselves with your own concerns and cast the remembrance of God behind your backs? This is a grievous loss unto yourselves, did ye but know. Would ye occupy yourselves with autumn in your days and forget God’s springtime among you? What aileth you that ye are not mindful? By God! We have detailed unto you with truth every counsel through a holy and beloved tongue, that ye might take counsel through God’s advice and not break what ye covenanted in the particles of the heavens in that Presence wherein the near ones were gathered together. There is no God but Him. His is the command and the truth, and all shall return unto Him. All who are in the heavens and the earth glorify Him, and all shall return unto Him. He it is Who hath ordained for every soul the measures of the Command, all of this in the Book, would ye but understand.</p>
<p>This is a Book from the Beauty of Holy Effulgence to God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. This is a Tablet from God, the Mighty, the Powerful, to the Beauty of Holy Effulgence Who shall appear hereafter as He willeth and desireth. This hath been inscribed by the Pen of Command upon the preserved Tablets of Glory, and none can avert it, nor can any prevent this exalted, resplendent, and gracious decree. Can anyone turn Him back from His sovereignty or prevent Him from His Command? Nay, by my Lord! Even should all the world rise up against Him, He shall appear with the truth, shall speak the Word of God, and His face shall shine between the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Essence of the Spirit! Manifest Thyself through Thy sovereignty and pay no heed to any of the evil ones. O Most Great Word! Cast upon the servants that which God hath cast into Thy heart, and fear no one, for verily Thy Lord shall protect Thee from the harm of the idolaters. O Heaven of Holiness! Raise Thyself to a station beyond the reach of the hands of the infidels. O Sun of Oneness! Rise upon all created things with the radiance of Thy holy lights, then bestow upon all beings that which God hath given Thee through His bounty, and withhold not from anyone Thy grace, for Thou art indeed the All-Bountiful, the Giving, the Generous, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Give the servants to drink of the wine that floweth from Thy right hand, for they are secretly athirst and yearning for the Command, and Thou art verily the Forgiving, the Merciful. O Most Great Ocean! Surge within Thyself with holy and effulgent waves, even as the seas of the spirit surge within Thy pure, wondrous, and exalted heart. O Tree of God! Bestow upon the near ones among the people of eternity from the wonderful, exalted, holy, and pure fruits of Paradise which God granted Thee before the creation of the heavens and earth. For from Thee all created things began and to Thee they shall return, and through Thee grace appeared before the creation of the first and the last ones. Were Thy grace to be cut off for less than a moment, nothing would remain, neither in the heavens nor on the earth. To this We bear witness with a tongue of manifest truth.</p>
<p>O Treasure of God! Reveal from the eternal, enduring, everlasting, and unitary treasures, that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom may become manifest. All this bounty is from Thee to all created things. Withhold not Thy hand from generosity, nor turn Thy gaze from beholding the worlds, for Thou art in Thyself a manifest Book and a proof to all who are in the heavens and the earth, and a guidance and remembrance to all in the kingdoms of Command and Creation. Thou art God’s proof among His creation, His evidence unto His servants, His sign unto His creatures, and His Word between the heavens and the earth. In Thy hand is all command; Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and decreest through Thy sovereignty what Thou desirest.</p>
<p>Whoso is honored by meeting Thee hath met God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Whoso walketh before Thee hath walked upon a mighty and straight path. Whoso gazeth upon Thy countenance hath gazed upon the face of God, and whoso turneth away hath turned away from God for all eternity. Blessed, then blessed is he who attaineth Thy presence, receiveth from Thee mighty and powerful words, beholdeth Thy beauty, heareth the melodies of God from Thy lips, and is touched by the breezes of Thy flowing, gentle, and luminous locks. Blessed is the land which God hath made the resting-place of Thy feet, and the station whereon the throne of Thy beauty is established.</p>
<p>Blessed is the seat whereon is established the throne of Thy beauty with manifest sovereignty, and blessed is the house which Thou enterest, wherein is raised the remembrance of Thy name, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, and wherein shineth Thy light and riseth Thy righteous proof. Blessed are the gardens past which Thou strollest and upon which Thou castest the glances of Thy favor, and at whose flowers, blossoms and trees Thou lookest with Thy penetrating vision. By God! The very dust touched by Thy foot should glory over the mighty throne. Blessed are they who circle round Thee and who hasten to serve Thee, whom neither the taunts nor tribulations can deter from entering the depths of the ocean of Thy Cause, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O ye dwellers of the heavens and earth, and O people of the Bayan! Waste not your deeds on that Day, and be not dismayed in this supreme and mighty terror. Enter ye through that Gate even though stones rain upon you from every direction. This is better for you, if ye be of them that know. Deprive not yourselves of this bounty, and do not act as ye have acted in these days. Fear ye God Who created you, and be not of them that turn aside. Fear God and follow no one this Day, but follow God’s command within yourselves, then hasten with your eyes toward God’s direction. Make no excuse and tarry not for any ornaments, but rush with the foot of detachment toward this blessed spot in the holy vale. Veil not yourselves from the beauty of God but hold fast to the cord of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. If it be winter, then warm yourselves at this inner fire, and if ye find the heat of summer, then cool yourselves with the water of life.</p>
<p>Know ye that God aids those who turn toward Him and guards them with the hosts of heaven and earth, if ye be of them that know. By God! Your turning toward this direction on that Day is better than the worship of both worlds. This is the Day whereon the breezes of life blow upon decayed bones, wherein every sick one is healed of his ailment, every afflicted and ailing one is cured, wherein lovers attain the beauty of the Beloved, and all who thirst arrive at the shores of a mighty Salsabil, and wherein every naked one is clothed with a noble, holy garment.</p>
<p>By God! At this moment the eyes of my inner being weep at my separation from His presence and what descendeth upon Him from the hosts of Satan. Would that I were present before Him to recount all that hath befallen us at the hands of these oppressors. Verily, He knoweth in truth what befalleth Him, and with Him is the knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and earth. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the Exalted, the Omniscient. Were He to wish to expound from a single Point the knowledge of what was and what will be, He would be able, and this would be easier for Him than all else, were ye of them that know.</p>
<p>O Essence of Immortality! Grieve not on that Day for anything, even if none among the worlds should be guided by Thy guidance. Verily, Thy remembrance of Thyself is better than the dominion of the first and the last ones, and Thy glances upon Thy beauty are more exalted than what is ordained in the highest realm, were all who are in the heavens and earth to prostrate before Thee. This would be better for them, and if they oppose Thee, verily Thou in Thy truth art independent of all worlds. In Thy grasp is the kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earth, and at Thy right hand is the empire of them that dwell in the realms of divine revelation.</p>
<p>And on Thy right hand is the dominion of all who dwell in the realms of mystery and creation, and Thou art indeed the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Therefore, forgive my transgressions and my sins which I have committed before Thee in these words, for this proceeded from naught but my love for Thyself and my remembrance before Thee, and verily Thou art, of this, All-Knowing, All-Informed. I have come before Thee with merchandise too mean to mention, with scant means. If Thou accept it, verily Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful, and if Thou reject and cast it away, verily Thou art the Most Just of the just. The command is in Thy hand and sovereignty is within Thy grasp. Thou shalt not be asked of what Thou doest, and all who stand before the gate of Thy bounty are among the supplicants.</p>
<p>O Name of God! Bear witness within thyself that there is none other God but Him. He hath created all contingent beings through a word of His utterance, and verily He is the Sovereign, the Single, the Mighty, the Beauteous. O My Name! Bear witness within thine essence that there is none other God but Him. He hath created all things through a word of His command, and verily He is the All-Conquering, the Omnipotent, the Mighty. O Letter of Eternity! Bear witness within thy spirit that He is God, there is none other God but Him. He hath sent forth the Prophets with the truth and dispatched them to all who dwell in the heavens and on earth, and verily He is the Most Exalted, the Most Great. O Breeze of Glory! Bear witness in thine inmost being that there is none other God but Him. He verily doth send forth the Prophets with the truth, and He is the Creator, the Ever-Living, the Most High. O Paradise of Love! Bear witness in thy secret heart that there is none other God but Him. He hath made manifest the Resurrection through His command and hath gathered together all who are in the heavens and on earth more swiftly than the twinkling of an eye. O Melody of Eternity! Bear witness in thy heart that there is none other God but Him. He shall manifest the Resurrection as He pleaseth and shall gather together His creatures as He willeth on the Day which shall come with the truth. This is what hath been inscribed on holy and preserved Tablets. Nothing can prevent Him and no command can hold Him back, even should all who are in the kingdom arise against Him.</p>
<p>Know thou that We have arrived in a mighty prison through what hath been ordained by the holy and luminous Pen. The matter hath become severe upon Us from all directions, and this is among the traditions of God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. In this there lieth a wisdom which no heart can comprehend save whom thy Lord willeth, and He shall make it manifest among the worlds when He pleaseth. Nothing appeareth on earth except that the measures of destiny have been ordained for it by One Who is All-Wise, All-Knowing. Not an atom moveth except that a consummate wisdom hath been ordained for it - how much more so for this Most Great, Most Momentous Announcement!</p>
<p>There hath befallen Us what befell Ali on earth. Therefore, know ye the mystery of the Cause, O peoples of the world! There hath transpired unto Us all that transpired unto him, and this is an ordinance from the Lord of the worlds. Say: He was imprisoned in a place whose name none of the lovers had heard, even as We have been imprisoned in these days in a place whose name was never before mentioned, if ye be of them who know. Thus did it transpire as it had transpired before, and was ordained as it had been ordained before, and in this are signs for them who possess understanding.</p>
<p>Say: The Beauty of the Former One hath appeared in the temple of the Latter One - blessed be God, the most excellent of creators! And the Beauty of the Latter One shall appear in the temple of the Former One - exalted be God, the most powerful of ordainers! Thus do We mention unto thee hidden holy allusions that thou mayest be of the assured ones, and We expound unto thee from that which hath been treasured in the divine repositories of knowledge from time immemorial.</p>
<p>Say: He hath verily raised Me up with the truth and caused Me to speak forth wondrous and manifest verses which all who are in the heavens and on earth are powerless to comprehend, that I might guide you to the straight path and impart unto you what was inscribed in the Bayan by God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God, then open your eyes to the holy and noble perspective of God, and corrupt not the Cause of God, and follow not the imaginings of the corrupt ones. Follow ye the command of God in the Bayan and answer the call of God within yourselves.</p>
<p>Answer the summons of God within your souls and follow not the ways of those who have joined partners with God and were among the idolaters. Say: We desire naught save what God hath desired in His Book, and this doth the Tongue of truth and knowledge testify. We wish for naught except what God hath revealed in the Book of Glory in a clear Arabic tongue. Say: These are verses sent down in truth - by them are the souls of all created things renewed, by them are God’s ordinances detailed in what was revealed in the preserved holy Tablets, and by them do the temples of names ascend to the pavilions of eternity while the measures of His Cause are ordained by One mighty and wise. Say: The idolaters sought to cut off God’s bounty, alter His Word, complete His Cause, and overturn His judgment. Evil is what they have imagined within themselves, were ye among the discerning. Thus did they desire to silence God’s melodies from the region of Iraq and other realms - this is what they consulted about among themselves, and We were witness to it all. Therefore doth God manifest in the Holy Land one who remembers Him with loudest voice, that God’s proof might thereby be made manifest despite their will. This is what We have ordained at this time through this radiant and luminous Pen, that ye may know that God exalteth His Cause through His power and nothing in the heavens or earth can frustrate Him, nor can the prevention of these deluded ones hinder Him. Say: The holy breezes waft from this direction to all regions - this is from God’s grace, the Mighty, the Powerful. They shall not cease for less than a moment, and all in the heavens and those of pure nature shall find them. Say: O people! Do ye plot against God’s Cause and deceive yourselves thereby? For God is more severe in plotting, were ye among those who know. Soon will He seize you for your plotting and raise up His Cause as He willeth, manifest His proof and establish His signs, though these hateful ones detest them. O Bird of Eternity! Come forth from the Ridvan by God’s leave, then sing upon the branches of contingent being with holy and sublime melodies. O Youth of Paradise! Appear from the chambers and sing with thy loudest voice in the realms of names and attributes. Tarry not for less than a moment and be not among the disappointed. Then illumine thyself from this Face that doth kindle and shine between earth and heaven, from which the denizens of the Supreme Concourse were illumined, then the forms of the ranked angels and cherubim. Then command the people as We have commanded thee and as was ordained in the Bayan from God, the Exalted, the Great. Be vigilant regarding thyself and exercise wisdom from One mighty and beauteous. Pay no heed to the deluded ones who attribute themselves to God while engaging in manifest deceit and craftiness. When they meet you they say “We believe in God and in what ye believe,” but when they sit with others like themselves, rancor and hatred appear from them. Thus have We recorded everything in a clear Book. Say: O people of the Bayan! Draw not nigh unto them or their like, and hearken not unto them even if they speak the truth, for if Satan speaketh the truth he still harbors deceit within himself - this is truth were ye among the discerning. Say: Whoso turneth away from this Light that shineth from this holy and luminous direction hath turned away from God and His proof.</p>
<p>This, verily, is the truth, were ye of those who are endowed with insight. Say: Whoso turneth away from this Light that hath shone forth from this holy and luminous Shore hath indeed turned away from God and His proof and His testimony and His signs and His evidence, and from all the Prophets and Messengers. Say: O peoples of the earth! Fear God, and follow not every idol and ass. Say: This is verily the Sun which hath risen through its own essence by its own essence, and this is verily the Fire of God which hath been kindled by itself through itself, and this is verily the Guidance of God which hath appeared through its own reality by its own reality, were ye of those who possess knowledge. And whoso turneth away from it shall not be worthy to be called human, and shall be deprived of that which hath been ordained in the paradise of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High, the Mighty, the Gracious. Say: A single letter thereof is better for your souls than the dominion of all who were before and shall come after. All this is a bounty from Our presence unto thee and unto the sincere among His servants. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and differ not concerning the Cause of God, and transgress not beyond what hath been inscribed in the Bayan by the Finger of God, the Ever-Living, the Most High, the All-Powerful. Beware lest ye be heedless within your own selves and occupy yourselves with that which your desires dictate unto you. Rather, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God at all times and seasons. By God! One remembrance of Him is, in the sight of God, more precious than the creation of the heavens and earths. And forget not the tribulations that have befallen Us, then remember Our days amongst you, and be not of the heedless ones. And exchange not the words of God for the words of any other, then be steadfast in His love even if every deceitful wretch should oppose you. Thus do We expound unto you all things in detail, and cast upon you holy words, and remind you with a wondrous reminder. And should tribulation touch you in the path of your Creator, grieve not, and reflect upon what hath come upon Us from the hosts of Satan. By God! Were the world and all that is therein to possess worth in the sight of God equal to that of a gnat’s wing, no humiliation would ever befall any of the believers therein. Therefore lift up your gaze above the world and its people, then look upon the countenance of Him Who hath shone forth like the sun from a holy and gleaming horizon. Then gather ye together to aid the Cause of God and to exalt His Word, and tarry not therein for less than a moment. This is My counsel unto you, if ye be of those who advance. God hath indeed prescribed for Himself that He shall aid those who aid His Cause and who were among the helpers. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

<p>He is the Manifest, the Resplendent, the Self-Evident, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>One manifestation of the Name “the Most Generous” cast its radiance upon the earth–bounty became manifest, the heavenly feast descended, and the ocean of generosity surged forth. And one manifestation of the Name “the All-Knowing” shed its effulgence upon the world–all were adorned with the raiment of knowledge, and the Herald of Glory from the right hand of the Throne of Grandeur proclaimed the blessed words “We have recorded all things in a clear Book.” O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto that which hath been raised from the direction of the Most Sublime Vision of God. By God! This is the Day wherein every hidden thing hath been revealed, wherein the Hour hath come and the moon hath been cleft asunder. Beware lest the veils of them that have turned away and disbelieved prevent you, or the might of the denizens of hell-fire who have changed God’s bounty into ingratitude and turned away from the choice wine and the Kawthar frighten you. O people! Fear God and oppose not Him through Whose light the earth and heaven were illumined and through Whom the decree of destiny was manifested. He hath come for your salvation and to draw you nigh unto God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat. Were He to will to adorn all things with the ornament of names at this moment and take it from them at another, He verily hath power to do so. None can say “Why?” or “Wherefore?” He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: O Hadi! Hearken unto the divine call. This Wronged One hath mentioned thee, and continueth to mention thee, for the sake of God, that thou mayest perchance find a way unto Him. Reflect upon thine acts, and likewise upon that which hath shone forth from the Dayspring of divine knowledge and power, that thou mayest haply return from the rivulet to the ocean, from tyranny to justice, and from oppression to equity. O Hadi! Forget not God’s favor unto thee. Turn thy face toward God, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and say:</p>
<p>My God! I have forsaken what is with the factions who believed not in Thee and in Thy signs, and I have turned toward Thee. Take my hand through Thy power and sovereignty, then deliver me through Thy favors and bounties. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I acknowledge my heedlessness and error before the manifestations of the lights of the Sun of Thy knowledge, and my wrongdoing before the dawning of the Luminary of Thy justice. How many a day did the light of Thy bounty turn toward me from the horizon of the heaven of Thy grace, and I turned away from it. Alas! Alas! My vain imaginings prevented me from drawing nigh unto the Luminary of certitude which shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy Will, and doubts veiled me at the appearance of Thy Name, the Self-Subsisting. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy signs, and the standards of Thy Manifestation and Thy power, and by Thy Most Exalted Word whereby the realities of all things were attracted, and by Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen, to forgive my grievous sins. I testify that by Thy command the ocean of forgiveness surged in the contingent world and the fragrance of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was diffused amongst all religions.</p>
<p>O thou who art attracted by My verses and soaring in the atmosphere of My love! We have repeatedly made mention of Hadi Dawlat-Abadi and summoned him to the most exalted horizon, yet that heedless one hath until now remained unaware and hath not attained unto the blessed word “I believe in God.” He hath cast aside acceptance and chosen denial, manifesting an oppression unmatched and unparalleled. For he hath denied a station which, from the earliest days until now, hath stood manifest before the faces of the heedless, the monotheists and the polytheists, calling all with the most exalted call to the straight path and heralding the advent of the Great News. Say: O Hadi! Great is the Cause this day. The Primal Point uttereth “I am the foremost of them that worship.” Fear God. Consider that which hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s will. Beware lest thou follow the ways of the ignorant. If thou seekest verses, they have indeed filled the horizons, and if thou seekest proofs, turn to the sacred writings. O thou who art devoid of justice! He declareth that if anyone should utter but a single verse, ye should not oppose him, and yet now there existeth and is manifest the equivalent of all the books of the first and the last. Come and behold! Train not the people of the Bayan as the Shi’ih sect was trained, and bar them not by their names from the Lord of all creation. Reflect upon the deeds and words of that sect; perchance thou mayest turn from doubt to certitude and from the left hand to the right. For the sake of God it is said, for the sake of God hear it: how many souls in that land, despite their glory, exaltation, wealth and power, have forsaken all before thy face and freely sacrificed their lives at the feet of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. Take heed, O ye whose darkness hath taken the place of admonition! Take heed, O ye whose whiteness hath appeared upon your cheeks!</p>
<p>The black spot of the heart’s fancy hath prevailed over its radiance and obliterated its traces. At the mere mention of the Bab, fear seized thy limbs, to such extent that thou didst mount the pulpit and utter that which caused the people of the cities of justice and fairness to weep. Reflect upon thine own deeds and the deeds of the detached souls, that thou mayest not remain deprived of the ocean of grace, bounty and bestowal. Ponder upon that which thou didst utter from the pulpit. The martyrdom of His Holiness Ashraf, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, had newly come to pass. Some reflection was needed concerning his protection and his sacrifice, that perchance thou mightest succeed and attain to confession after denial. His sacrifice testifieth to his truthfulness and steadfastness, while thy life beareth witness to thy falsehood, repudiation and calumny. Glory be to God! Love for the fleeting life of two days hath deprived thee of eternal grace and divine mercy. Thou didst satisfy Ibn-i-Dhi’b. I was present in the gathering of the divines when Ibn-i-Dhi’b spoke, saying: “O people! The renunciation, repudiation and denial of Hadi, who was among the leaders of the Babi party, and his cursing and execration, sufficeth us. He hath left no further proof for us to require. Therefore we consider him a believer in the Divine Book, namely the Qur’an, and according to the outward law we cannot associate him with any but the party of salvation.” In brief, he did that which caused the liver of them that are nigh unto God to melt. I know not by what proof he believed in God, and by what evidence he turned away from Him. We beseech God to aid him to return and repent. Verily He is the Oft-Returning, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We desire to behold him ascending to the heaven of knowledge and mysteries, and rising to the summit of truth, while he desired for himself the lusts of passion, turning away from what the Lord of all beings, the Possessor of the Hereafter and the First, desired for him.</p>
<p>One of the friends has been seen saying: “What has happened that Azal has become rejected?” Say: O thou who art devoid of justice, fear God! One through whose Word a thousand Azals have been and are being created - from Him thou hast turned away and hast uttered calumnies such that all things have cried out. Apart from this, thou knowest not from what source names have appeared. Ye have committed that which no oppressor hath ever committed. Ye have called the Dayyan ‘Father of Evil’ and the Friend of the All-Merciful ‘Father of Calamities’, and ye have passed judgment on and martyred many of the oppressed ones of the world, and like unto the Shi’ih sect ye have done that which causeth loss in this world and the next. This name which thou hast mentioned - from whom is it and who hath bestowed it? If thou sayest it is from the Source of the Bayan, the Bayan itself with loudest voice rejecteth thee and saith: “Silence thy tongue, O heedless one!” For it declareth: “Through the Bayan and its letters be not deprived of its Source and Manifestation.” And if that name hath appeared from the Most Exalted Station, which is the station of the manifestation of the Most Great News, verily He doeth what He willeth. He giveth and He taketh away. He is praiseworthy in His acts and obeyed in His command. O heedless one! The banner “He doeth what He willeth” is unfurled before His face, despite thee and those who cast behind them God’s Covenant and His Testament and disputed His verses. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One: Leave the gulf of names, then make for the ocean of meanings and utterance. This is what thou art commanded by the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. By God’s life! Neither a name from among names, nor anything from among things shall profit thee except through this manifest Cause and this mighty News. Leave names and turn to the evidences that there may become clear and known to thee that which today is hidden from most. If thou possessest sight and hearing, ponder this word of the Primal Point - exalted be His glory: “I have written a gem concerning His remembrance, which is that He shall not be known through any reference nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan.” After such a perfect and decisive word, is it possible to cling to the Bayan and be deprived of its Source? Nay, by His true Self! From this blessed word, argument through the Bayan is forbidden, and in the Most Great Manifestation mention of aught else was not and is not acceptable. Today the Point of the Bayan uttereth “Verily, I am the first of them that worship,” while ye are occupied with that which is unworthy of mention, although that same Point sacrificed His life in the path of this Most Great News and in the nights and days spoke in remembrance of Him and was mindful and grieved for what would befall Him. The lamentation of the Bayan is raised on account of the oppressors’ tyranny, but hearing ears are lacking and penetrating vision is not to be found. Where were ye in the days when this Wronged One was beneath chains and fetters - at times in stocks and under judgment, and at times in the hands of the heedless? In the land of Mim there befell this Wronged One that which hath befallen no one before or since. Were it not for the Glory, who would have spoken before all faces? And were it not for Him, who would have manifested the Cause of God, the Lord of existence? Say: Be fair, by God! This is He through Whom was raised the banner “Verily He is God” upon the highest standards.</p>
<p>Say: Were it not for Him Who hath manifested the Cause of God, the Lord of all being, how could it be made known? Say: Be fair, by God! He it is through Whom was hoisted the banner of ‘He is God’ upon the highest standards, and before the faces of all peoples surged the ocean of divine knowledge. In times of hardship they are the first to deny God, and in times of ease they are the first to claim belief in Him. The Pen is bewildered and the Tablet is bewildered as to what to recount. Although this Most Great Revelation hath never needed mention of aught else to establish its Cause, yet in consideration of the people’s weakness, that which was recorded may guide the fair-minded to the horizon of the Cause and direct the seekers to the true Ka’bah. For four months in the presence of the Sultan, We endured such torments that pen and ink are powerless to describe, and the tongue is unable to recount. Say: O company of the heedless! Today proofs and evidences circle round, yet veils of fancy and idle imagination have prevented eyes from beholding. Throughout all those grievous days, Mirza Yahya remained secure and protected beneath pavilions of grandeur, along with his wives and children, in utmost comfort. Every fair-minded and informed person beareth witness to this. On the day of separation, We left him with his wives and children in perfect health and well-being, and departed. The reason for this is clear and evident to the fair-minded. Not a single blow befell him or those with him. The truthful witnesses are those souls who are now present and visible in Cyprus. Say: […]</p>
<p>O concourse of the heedless! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, and deprive not yourselves of the effulgent rays of the Orb of justice, equity, truthfulness and sincerity. If the fault of this Wronged One be the verses of God and the manifestation of His clear tokens, this matter hath ever been within the grasp of His might. Verily, He raised Me up when I was seated, the hand of His loving-kindness stirred Me when I was asleep, and He caused Me to speak forth amongst His servants when I was silent. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. He commanded Me to raise a call betwixt earth and heaven. My proof is that which hath appeared and shall appear through Me, and My evidence is My rising up to proclaim this Cause and to reveal that which I have been bidden by Him, in such wise that neither the might of the world nor the clamor of the nations hath deterred Me. Have mercy upon yourselves and upon the Wronged One, through Whom God’s sovereignty, power, grandeur and might have been made manifest. He hath revealed the Cause before the faces of the princes and kings, and hath delivered unto them the messages of God, His laws, His commandments; and in this He desired naught save the reformation of the world and the extinguishing of the fire of hatred and animosity in the hearts of the peoples. If the heedless ones would observe with justice, they would comprehend from Whose presence came the Tablets that were sent to the Primal Point. Verily, today this Wronged One declareth the Cause through that which hath been sent down from Him and revealed from His presence, and calleth all unto the Truth. Blessed are the just, blessed are the discerning, and joy be to them that have attained. By the life of God! The deniers of the Bayan, be they Hadi or others, are not aware of the root of the Cause, for they were not with Us. Would that they had been vouchsafed but one drop from the ocean of knowledge! They cling to names while remaining deprived of Him Who raised them up and gave them life. Say: The names shall profit you not, nor that which ye possess of idle fancies and vain imaginings. By the Truth of God! The Possessor hath come with manifest sovereignty. Take ye what hath appeared from the Truth, and leave what the people possess. This is what ye have been commanded by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Cast away what ye possess of idle fancies. By God! The Sun of Certitude hath dawned from the horizon of your Lord’s Will, He Who hath power over all that was and shall be. Behold the Tree and its fruits with your own eyes, and the Light and its radiance, and the Sun and its rays. Beware lest ye cast behind your backs the counsel of God. Take hold of it with the power granted by Him and the sovereignty conferred by Him. Verily, He aideth whom He willeth through His command “Be, and it is!” We have sent down from the heaven of grace that which hath illumined the kingdom of wisdom and utterance, and whereby eyes have been solaced. Blessed is he who hath clung to the verses of God, which have filled all regions. Say: Read ye what hath been sent down from the heaven of your Lord’s Will to the princes and divines. Should anyone desire to witness with his own eyes the sovereignty and power of God, let him purify himself from the mention of all else and present himself before the Divine Countenance, that he might hear and see that for which the Manifestations of Justice and Daysprings of Knowledge died in their yearning. I know not by what path he who hath turned away hath directed himself, by what proof he hath established his claims, or by what evidence he denieth Him Who from the earliest days hath been calling out in the name of God, the Lord of the Promised Day. Say: Fear God, and follow not the ways of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed. By the life of God! When the verses were sent down from the heaven of Will, the Primal Point prostrated himself […]</p>
<p>I swear by the life of God! When the verses were sent down from the heaven of Will, the Primal Point prostrated himself and said: “I believe in Thee, O Sovereign of existence!” Say: This is a Revelation to which none before or after can comprehend except to a prescribed measure. Say: Hear what the tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in the Bayan: “He Whom God shall make manifest hath the right to reject him who is not above anyone on earth.” Beware lest thou deny Him through Whose mention the Books of God, the Lord of the unseen and the seen, have been adorned. Although it beseemeth not one like Me to adduce proof of His Cause through mention of aught else, yet when We perceived the weakness and frailty of the servants, We mentioned that which was revealed aforetime as a mercy from Us unto them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Say: Fear God, O opposer, and be not of those who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament by following every veiled barking one. Hearken unto the Call which hath been raised from the Most Sublime Horizon in this Prison which hath been named the Most Great Prison by the Lord of eternity. He calleth thee for the sake of God and counseleth thee since He seeth thee wandering in the wilderness of passion. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. We make mention of thee and guide thee for the sake of God and desire from thee no recompense. We have opened before thy face the door of grace that thou mayest enter and behold with thine own eyes the Sun of knowledge and justice from God, the Lord of the Kingdom and the Realm.</p>
<p>Hear once again in the Persian tongue the call of the Blessed Tree, perchance thou mayest turn towards the House of God and sanctify thyself from idle fancies, vain imaginings and ancient tales. Throughout the ages, the Shi’ih sect engaged in disputation amongst themselves until finally they pronounced each other infidels. Now consider: what was the glory of that sect, and what became their recompense on the Day of God? Reflect with fairness: By My life! Until this time the true meaning of divine unity hath not been understood, nor hath anyone previously attained unto it. If thou desirest to understand, sanctify thyself from all thou hast heard, then ask God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Throne and of the earth, and the Lord of the last and the first, that He may cast upon thee that which shall deliver thee from the chains of self and passion, and guide thee to His straight path.</p>
<p>O people of the Bayan! Cleave ye unto the Book of the Temples which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto His Name, the Judge. Verily, it is the hidden knowledge, the treasured secret, and the preserved symbol which God hath deposited in the heart of him whom He named the Judge in the kingdom of the Bayan. Every soul must look into that Book, for He hath named it the hidden and treasured knowledge. One must ponder upon the cause of its revelation and the reason for its appearance, that haply they may attain unto that which God intended for His servants.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Despite the entreaty of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - and His testament enjoining all to oppose not the Most Great Revelation, yet some, styling themselves mirrors, others claiming to be successors, and yet others calling themselves guardians, remain deprived of the Truth. Soon, like the sect before them, titles such as Chief and Noble will emerge, and perchance even a fourth pillar will be found.</p>
<p>Say: O ye who turn aside! Hearken unto the Wronged One. Let not the Bayan keep you from the Purpose of all worlds. Say: By the life of God! Neither the Bayan nor what the people possess will profit you except through the Mother Book which speaketh at the final return. The Owner hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>If any soul fail to comprehend the purpose of the Book of the Temples, he should present himself before Us and become acquainted with its meaning, that he may enlighten the people of the Bayan, perchance they might find a way unto the Truth. In this Day, the Bayan and all else are contingent upon acceptance. Some, through the word Mustaghath, remain deprived of the river of divine mercy and the ocean of heavenly wisdom. Say: O heedless ones of the world! This word too was from the Bayan; by the words of the Point it is not permissible to cite it as proof. His exalted Word declares: Beware, beware lest thou be veiled by what was revealed in the Bayan. Repeatedly hath He said: Let not the Bayan and what is therein deprive you from the Sovereign of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen.</p>
<p>After mentioning Mustaghath He declareth: Should He appear at this very moment, I would be the first to worship Him. And in another place He saith: None knoweth the time of the Revelation save God. Whenever it cometh to pass, all must acknowledge the Point of Truth and render thanks unto God. Some were and are unaware. Say: O servants! While time remaineth, strive that ye may attain unto that for which ye were created from nothingness. Reflect upon the ignorance of the Guide at a time when the Ocean of divine utterance is manifest and visible, and the Sun of evidence is dawning from the horizon of the heaven of Will[…]</p>
<p>Say! The clear evidence and resplendent proof hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of Will, manifest and apparent. Yet His followers have been commanded to reject Him, and now they are consumed by the fire of hatred and rancor, and perceive it not. Say: O heedless one! Again and again have We proclaimed that the Divine Lote-Tree hath appeared with innumerable fruits, and the Sun of Truth hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of bounty. Behold with thine own eyes and hearken with thine own ears. If this Cause be denied, then by My life, no cause would be worthy of acceptance. To this testifieth every seeing one and every just and knowing soul. Were the Point of the Bayan (may the life of all else be sacrificed for His sake) present in these days, He would be engaged in writing before His face. Say: Cast away idle fancies and vain imaginings, and take what hath come to you from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. For the sake of God, let the possessors of justice and fairness - namely those souls who possess hearing and sight and are endowed with heart and mind - journey to the island and then to this land, that perchance they may be adorned with the ornament of justice and fairness and may speak the truth. The deniers are deprived of the eyes of sincerity, purity, justice and fairness, and are occupied with former lies and calumnies. The Book of Certitude was specifically revealed in the presence of the Uncle (upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God), and therein is mentioned the circumstances of this Wronged One’s imprisonment and journey. Yet they have attributed it to another. Say: O heedless one! Ask of the Afnan, that it may become clear and evident unto thee.</p>
<p>One of the kinsmen who was named Muhammad-Hasan came to this land and upon his return was bearing seventy Tablets for the servants of God. After arriving in the land of Ta, they imprisoned him and then sent him to a known village where he ascended. Those Tablets were stolen by one of the women of that land and sent to her sister who resided in the land of Ta. God alone knoweth what she did with them - whether she gave them out in her own name or in the name of Mirza Yahya. By God’s life! He was not with Us and was unaware of this matter. A grave error appeared from him in that he sent a leaf that was from the Friend and attributed to Him to the house of the enemy for the sake of worldly glory, and then he turned away and clung to another. His actions are known and evident to most. He is unable to read a single Tablet, yet he hath so added to the imaginings of the deluded ones that none but God is aware of it. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He was not with Us and was unaware; they were elsewhere. In any case, he became disappointed in his deed and turned to another. Glory be to God! Sixty years of his life have passed, and until now he hath not attained to what is befitting. Love of the world and station induced him to commit that which caused the sighs of those near unto God to rise and the tears of the sincere ones to flow. It is reported that he was also in search of the Book of Certitude to obtain it. It is not known what scheme he had devised for it and what he intended. We beseech God to assist him to return, to repent, and to submit. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Merciful, the Most Generous. And He is the All-Bountiful, the Munificent, the Mighty, the Kind. Say[…]</p>
<p>O concourse of the heedless! The Point crieth out at this moment and saith: Have mercy, O people of the Bayan! By God! He hath appeared for Whose sake I sacrificed My life. I exhort you, counsel you, and enjoin upon you to behold His signs with your own eyes and to hearken with your own ears unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His will. Fear God, and reject not the truth by virtue of what ye possess. Reflect by what proof ye believed and by what evidence ye turned unto My countenance and took hold of My Book. By My life! The pavilion of glory hath been raised, and the tabernacle of grandeur pitched. Ye have attained unto a Day the like of which the eye of creation hath never beheld. Know ye His station. Do ye not see the Banner of the Bayan exalted upon the most sublime horizon? Do ye not behold the Standard of “There is no God but Him” amidst all religions? Cast aside what ye possess. By the life of God! A single word of that which hath been sent down in truth from the heaven of His grace cannot be equaled. Ascend ye the steps of names that ye may perchance attain unto the heaven of inner meanings. This is not the day of names.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! The Wronged One hath become a victim of injustice, for the unjust ones of the world have transgressed beyond all bounds and have clung to iniquity. Today all must aid the Cause of God through purity and detachment. The penetration and influence of the Word dependeth upon the piety and detachment of its speaker. Some souls content themselves with words alone, yet the truthfulness of words is conditional upon deeds. Through deeds is one’s station and rank made manifest. Words too must accord with that which hath proceeded from the mouth of God’s Will in His Tablets. Were some souls to ponder upon what hath outwardly transpired, they would not have deprived the essence of their hearing from what behooveth them by heeding the words of certain liars and calumniators. This Wronged One, by order of His Majesty the Sultan, journeyed from the Land of ?a to Iraq, accompanied by representatives from both the Persian and Russian embassies. Some time after Our arrival, Mirza Yahya appeared. Consider: had there been any place of safety other than the shadow of God, he would surely have turned to it. Furthermore, when We migrated from Zawra to the Great City, after informing the Vali, We proceeded in accordance with the ordinances of the Sublime State. At the time of departure, We summoned Yahya and bade him proceed to Persia, that he might safeguard the Writings of the Point which had been collected with great difficulty from various quarters. After Our departure, he abandoned the Writings and proceeded to Mosul with an Arab, where he awaited the arrival of the exiles from the Land. When We arrived, he joined Us. Judge ye fairly by God! Had he observed a place of greater security and comfort than the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree, he would surely have turned thereunto. Say: O people of the Bayan! Reflect upon that which hath appeared in truth, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath befallen this Wronged One in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Despite these clear indications and manifest signs, they have said what the oppressors never said and done what the idolaters never did. During that migration seventy souls were present, and he was with that company day and night. Nevertheless, he wrote to some that he had not been with the group, and those embodiments of vain imaginings accepted this. In brief, whithersoever We turned, he came and joined Us. Were they to ponder upon that which hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen and that which hath outwardly come to pass, all would turn from oppression and tyranny unto justice and fairness. Say[…]</p>
<p>O Hadi! Fear God, fear God, and follow not thy desires, nor the calumnies of those who have broken God’s covenant and testament. Observe, observe: the ocean is before thy face. Hearken, hearken: the call hath been raised between earth and heaven. Return unto the signs of God and His mercy, that perchance they may draw thee to the horizon of glory and thou mayest find thyself seated upon the throne of justice from God, the Lord of bounty and grace.</p>
<p>Some time ago We revealed a prayer from the Supreme Pen and sent it to the Land of Sad, that Hadi might recite it, detached from all save God, that he might attain unto return. However, the deaf rock was not moved by the breezes of the utterance of the Lord of Names, and received no portion from the waves of the ocean of bounty. We have commanded that prayer to be written in this Tablet and sent forth, for its recitation is most efficacious. We beseech God to aid all to do what He loveth and approveth.</p>
<p>O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who turnest toward the lights of My countenance, and drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! Hear My call: verily there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Commander, the All-Wise. Some time ago thy letter arrived, and an answer was revealed and sent forth from the divine Kingdom of utterance. The friends in the cities and regions were each illumined by the splendors of the Sun of Providence. By the life of God, they attained unto that which hath no like nor equal. We beseech Him to grant all the most great steadfastness.</p>
<p>O Nabil, O Nabil! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. Through divine power and celestial sovereignty We have arisen before the faces of all. Chains did not prevent Us, imprisonment did not hinder Us, events did not cause Us fear, might and clamor and ranks and hosts did not impede Us, until the Sun of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of every city, and through the power of the Supreme Pen and the influence of the Most Exalted Word, in every land the signs became manifest and the fragrances of utterance were diffused. Now from behind the veil a band hath emerged and committed that which made the very essence of truth to weep.</p>
<p>O thou who clingest to the cord of My bounty! Despite the waves of the ocean of utterance and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth, the deniers did not turn, nor did they attain unto what was befitting. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having sent down Thy verses and manifested Thy clear tokens, and for having illumined the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee with the light of Thy knowledge, and of the sincere ones with the radiance of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy grace and the heaven of Thy generosity, and by that which was treasured in Thy knowledge and hidden in the stronghold of Thy protection, and by the pearls concealed in the treasuries of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all beings and Sovereign of the throne on high and of the dust beneath, to aid the deniers to turn, and the rejecters to acknowledge, and the heedless to return unto the court of Thy mercy and to repent before the gate of Thy pardon and forgiveness. Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, the All-Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He is the Hearing, the Answering.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I turn to Thee in repentance, for verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Glory be to Thee, O my God! I testify that I have committed that which hath rent asunder the heavens of justice and split the earth of equity. Have mercy upon me through Thy bounty, for Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful. I am he through whose tyranny the sighs of Thy sincere ones have ascended, and the tears of Thy trusted ones have fallen. I am he whose disobedience hath torn the veil of Thy sanctity and caused the people of the cities of Thy knowledge and grace to lament. I testify that in transgression I have surpassed the wicked among Thy creatures and have wrought that which hath caused the hearts of Thy chosen ones to melt. Have mercy upon me, O my Lord and my King, then forgive me through Thy grace, for Thou art the Forgiving, the Bountiful. I testify that I have committed that which hath caused the radiant faces in the highest Paradise to pale, and the leaves of the loftiest Garden to fall. I beseech Thee, O Shelter of the fearful, Refuge of the distressed, and Ultimate Hope of the mystics, to blot out my misdeeds which have prevented me from entering the depths of the ocean of Thy bounty and favor, and from stepping upon the carpet of Thy glory and bestowals. Alas! Alas! With the sword of my faithlessness I have cut down the tree of my hope, and with the fire of my rebellion I have burned the veil of my chastity and station. Where is the face, O my God, wherewith I may turn toward the lights of Thy countenance, and where is the worthiness whereby I may draw nigh unto the ocean of Thy pardon and mercy? Thou didst create me to exalt and elevate Thy Word, yet I have abased and brought it low. I am he who, O my God, hath denied Thy favor, disputed Thy signs, and rejected Thy proof and Thy testimony. Thou seest, O my God, how my tears prevent me from the wonders of Thy remembrance and praise, and my sighs bear witness to my heedlessness and error before Thy knowledge. I am he who hath not been ashamed before the Dayspring of Thy verses, the Dawning-Place of Thy clear tokens, the Repository of Thy knowledge, and the Source of Thy commandments and ordinances. Alas! Alas! for my transgressions which have kept me far from the shore of the ocean of Thy nearness, and my sins which have prevented me from standing before the door of Thy grace. Wilt Thou, O my God, deprive one who hath confessed his tyranny and acknowledged his sins, and hath testified to Thy abundant generosity and great bounty? Alas! Alas! The ocean of error turneth toward the ocean of Thy bestowal, and the sea of heedlessness and waywardness seeketh the ocean of Thy pardon and mercy. By Thy might, O Desired One of the world and Beloved of the nations, I wish to weep and lament over myself throughout the duration of Thy dominion and kingdom. How can I not weep? I weep for my tyranny in days wherein the Sun of Thy justice hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will. How can I not weep? I weep for my remoteness from the court of Thy nearness, my error at the descent of Thy bestowal, and my denial at the manifestations of Thy favor and blessings. I am he who, O my God, hath fled from the shadow of Thy mercy and taken for himself a station among Thy enemies. Would that I had been content with that! But I uttered that which caused the hearts of the people of the pavilion of Thy glory and majesty to tremble, and blood to flow from the eyes of the people of the cities of Thy knowledge and wisdom. Glory be to Thee, O my God and my Lord! How many a day didst Thou turn toward this servant and mention him through Thy bounty and call him to the ocean of Thy mercy and the horizon of Thy grace, while he turned away from Thee and Thy will and denied the wonders of Thy favors and gifts. O Lord! Have mercy upon him who hath no one to show him mercy except Thee, no refuge save Thee, no deliverance except through Thy bounty, and no escape save through Thy power. I testify, O my God, that through my tyranny the fruits of the Lote-Tree of the utmost boundary have changed, and the leaves of the highest Paradise have yellowed. Thou seest me, O my God, returning unto Thee.</p>
<p>When the leaves of the Most Exalted Paradise turned yellow, Thou seest me, O my God, turning unto Thee, remorseful for that which my hands, my tongue, my heart, my pen have wrought. I beseech bounty, O Lord of existence, and generosity, O Bestower of blessings. I testify, O my God, to Thy grace and favor, and to my wrongdoing and polytheism among Thy chosen ones and trustees. Alas, alas! Through my wrongdoing, earthquakes have seized the tribes of the cities of justice and equity, and then those who circled round Thy throne, O Lord of all beings and Master of the throne and dust. I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty, Thy majesty and Thy power which have encompassed Thy earth and Thy heaven, and by Thy ancient pardon and Thy all-pervading grace, to ordain for me that which will purify me from the defilement of my deeds which have prevented me from drawing nigh unto Thy most holy court and Thy sacred station. I testify that I was among the worshippers of vain imaginings while supposing myself to be of the assured ones, and was an idolater while deeming myself among the monotheists. Alas, alas! My deeds have blackened my face in Thy presence, and my transgressions have barred me from the door of Thy bounty which was opened to all in Thy earth and Thy heaven. Alas, alas! The arrows of my idle fancies have pierced the body of Thy Cause, and the swords of my disobedience have fallen upon the temple of Thy Will. Alas, alas! Through the fire of my heedlessness the hearts of the near ones have been consumed, and through my wrongdoing all things have lamented. Will returning unto Thee bring me nigh unto the court of Thy glory, and will turning toward Thy gate deliver me from my self and its rebellion, and free me from the evil of its deeds, its wrongdoing and its heedlessness? Nay, by Thy might and Thy glory! The things created in the kingdom of creation profit me not except through Thy command and judgment. O Lord! I testify at this moment to the sanctification of Thy Being from all similitudes and the exaltation of Thy Essence above mention and utterance. Thou art the All-Glorious, the Most High, in the beginning and in the end. My God, my God! Save me by the arm of Thy power from the pit of self and passion, and deliver me from the fire of tyranny and transgression. I know not, O my God, with what countenance to turn to Thee, after knowing that my trespasses and errors have come between me and Thy good-pleasure and nearness, and have prevented me from appearing before the throne of Thy justice. I remember Thee, O my God, in the evening, and I call upon Thee, O my Beloved, at daybreak, and I supplicate Thee, O my Master, at dawn, by Thy name the All-Bountiful, by Thy name the Ever-Flowing, and by Thy name the All-Giving. By Thy might and the penetrating influence of the breaths of Thy revelation and the power of Thy Will, my hope hath well-nigh been cut off because of my evil deeds and actions. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have hastened to the ocean of forgiveness with a sin greater than the mountains and vaster than the field of imagination. I beseech Thee, O Most High and Self-Sufficing, by the wonders of Thy bounty and grace and mercy which have preceded the earths and the heavens, and by Thy pardon which hath encompassed all contingent beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of names and attributes.</p>
<p>=== END BH00085 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00086 ===</p>
<p>In the name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath manifested the Cause amidst all peoples is verily our Lord and the Lord of all worlds, the Ancient Lord Who hath appeared with the Most Great Name - He at Whose appearance every edifice hath been shaken and every person thrown into confusion, save whom God hath willed, our Lord and the Lord of all who are in earth and heaven, and Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The fragrance wafting from the Supreme Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven be upon the chosen ones of God and His loved ones, through whom the light of divine unity hath shone forth from the horizon of every city and every land, and through whom the Day-Star of utterance hath dawned among the people of understanding, and that which the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’an hath been made manifest. They strive in God’s path and fear not the blame of any blamer. The servant testifieth that they are such souls as have been mentioned and praised in God’s Books, and their sovereignty, grandeur, steadfastness and constancy have been acknowledged, and none among the chosen ones hath suffered in God’s path the tribulations they have endured. Indeed, ’Ali-i-Murta?a in the Kingdom of Names hath declared: “Blessed are we and blessed are they, and their blessedness exceedeth our blessedness,” unto the end of his words. Through them the veils have been rent asunder, the signs have appeared, and the standards have been raised aloft - they whom the conditions of creation have not withheld from the Truth and whom the veils of the learned have not kept back from the Lord of Names. When they heard the Call between earth and heaven, they turned to the Supreme Horizon and said: “Here am I, O Creator of the heavens, Who hath appeared through Thy Most Great, Most Wondrous, Most Glorious Name!” Then with radiant faces they turned to the cities and villages and spoke to them of that which had been manifested from God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of the dust beneath. Upon them be the prayers of God, His mercy, His glory, His light, His might, His grace, His generosity and His bounty.</p>
<p>The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid them in all conditions and to protect them from those who have disbelieved and turned away from Him through Whom their stations were exalted and their ranks elevated. By God’s life! The servant’s heart hath melted, or nearly melted, at seeing how the people have turned away from Him Whom they claim to follow every morn and eve, night and day, rushing to His house to perform what they were commanded, their sighs ascending during their devotions and their lamentations rising up in humility and supplication. Yet when the Day-Star of Trial shone forth and the decree was revealed from the All-Merciful, they fled like frightened asses. Would that they had been content with flight and denial! Nay, they arose in opposition and protest and committed that which caused the dwellers of the realms above and the inmates of the pavilions of the Kingdom to lament, and beyond them arose the dust of sorrows until it darkened the garment of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>The servant, who is clinging to the cord of His grace and holding fast to the hem of His bounty, beseecheth his Lord at this hour to adorn His servants with the ornament of fairness and guide them through His bounty and favor to the straight path. My spirit be a sacrifice for your love, for your service, and for your loneliness and tribulation! I was contemplating the conditions and events of the world and observing all things like one bewildered, perplexed and astounded, when lo, the scratching of your pen drew me to you and attracted me to your direction. When I heard the melody of utterance and the cooing of the dove of yearning and longing, I turned toward the Dawning-Place of Light and presented what was in your letter before God, the Lord of all horizons. When […]</p>
<p>In the name of the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing! O My Name! Through My power, utterance hath been revealed and made manifest from the Kingdom of knowledge, whereupon the essence of remembrance, utterance, proof, evidence, faith and certitude were struck with bewilderment and amazement, save whom God willeth. O My Name! What hath come to pass that the people remain deprived of the breezes of the springtime of mercy and the fragrances of the divine days? Knowledge, understanding, yearning, longing, attraction and enchantment - all were created for this Day. Nevertheless, the mirrors of existence remain bereft of the effulgences of the Sun of Revelation. If any soul heareth not this call, verily he hath no ears to hear, and if he faileth to behold the lights of Revelation, he possesseth not, nor shall he ever possess, the power of sight. To what do they turn, and from what do they turn away? Glory be unto Him Who hath unveiled unto you what He hath concealed from them, through that which their hands have wrought.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the primary cause for the veiling and turning away of heedless souls hath been the leaders in outward affairs - those who count themselves among the learned and consider themselves the heads of religion. All things bear witness and lament the tyranny of those heedless and wayward souls. They say “We believe in God,” then they invent lies about Him and perceive it not. They rise up and pray, yet they understand not. They have been and are honored by the name of Truth, yet for Him they have desired and continue to desire the most great abasement. Were they to become sincere for but a moment, they would surely hearken unto the cooing of the Dove of the Cause and turn from the north to the right hand.</p>
<p>Blessed is the learned one whom vain desire hath not hindered from the Lord of all beings. When he heareth, he turneth unto God and respondeth to His call, and ariseth to serve the Cause in such wise that he seeth the Truth before his eyes and all creation behind him. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken before the creation of earth and heaven, and in this hour every hearing ear hath heard from it what the ear of Moses heard on the Sinai of utterance and what the Beloved heard when He turned toward God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By God! The proof of God hath been perfected, and in its completeness it circleth round the Throne, yet the people are in evident doubt. They behold the signs yet deny them, they hear the call yet turn away from it. Verily they are in grievous loss.</p>
<p>Grieve thou not over anything. Under all conditions remain steadfast in My service, speaking My praise, acting according to what hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My Cause, and bidding what We have revealed in My mighty Book. The servant present hath appeared and read thy letter before the Wronged One. We have answered thee with truth and sent unto thee that whereby the eyes of those who have not violated God’s Covenant and His Testament, and who have clung to the hem of their Lord’s pardoning robe, are consoled. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded and My grace which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Say: O concourse of chosen ones! It behooveth you to observe wisdom and that whereby this firm, this mighty Cause may be exalted. And We remember My handmaidens who have heard and turned unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Distinction hath vanished from between, for it is observed that certain appointed heedless souls have not comprehended the station of the trace, let alone that of Him Who is the Influencer. They recite the divine verses yet remain unaware of their station and deprived of their fragrances. Likewise, they behold His evidences yet remain veiled from their recognition. Glorified be God! To such an extent have eyes been […]</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Eyes have been so afflicted with weakness and infection that they cannot distinguish light from darkness. I beseech God to grant them success and aid them, to purify them from self and desire, and to adorn them with that which He loves and is pleased with. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the hereafter and the first.</p>
<p>O thou who art beloved of My essence and being! In every moment there appears from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance that from which every receptive soul inhales the fragrance of the most exalted Paradise. And if I say that rock and clay have become the essence of awareness and have inclined their ears to hear the call of God, exalted be His glory - this is truth and there is no doubt in it. For today the entire world is adorned with the novel ornament of existence, and God’s hidden and manifest bounty has descended upon all. Favor is witnessed to this degree and measure, and proof is observed to this extent. Nevertheless, all are heedless and turned away, save whom God, the Lord of lords, wills.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the non-receipt of petitions and correspondence: thus far, for every letter from your honor that has arrived, a detailed reply has been written and sent. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that all that was sent may arrive. All were adorned with manifest verses and sublime words, both those specifically for your honor and those for the mentioned souls. O my God! Cause what Thou hast revealed to reach Thy Name, then grant him the bounty of Thy utterance and the feast of Thy heaven. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things. Thus far this servant has sent four, and despite the multitude of occupations and extensive writing, there has been no negligence or delay in responding to your honor’s letters.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about visiting the land of Ishtihard and the maidservants and servants of God in that place - upon them be the glory of God - it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of our Lord’s will, the Most High, the Most Great. He says, exalted be His utterance, mighty be His sovereignty, and glorious be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Compassionate, the Generous […]</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen makes mention of the people of Alif and Shin, and counsels them according to what befits their relationship to the Most Great Name. The numbered days and limited, perishable ornaments of this world are not and never were worthy of attention or mention. Hold fast unto truth and cling to the hem of His grace. Know ye your rank and station. Praise be to God that ye have attained unto that which most of the peoples of the earth remain heedless and veiled from, as well as the divines and mystics who regarded themselves as leaders of the flock and guides of the people, except for those learned ones who, in the name of the Self-Subsisting, partook of the sealed wine and shattered the idols of fancy and conjecture with the arm of certitude. Know ye the value and station of divine favors and occupy yourselves with His mention and praise. His bounties have been and shall ever be beyond reckoning, and His grace all-encompassing. As is evident, in the Most Great Prison, through the agencies of remembrance and the instruments of utterance, He hath built and continueth to build for each one a lofty palace. These palaces shall never perish, nor shall the passage of time bring them to ruin, for they have been raised by the hand of power and erected through His pure bounty. Know ye this and then give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. The clamor of the divines, the croaking of the ignorant, and the oppression and might of princes have not endured and shall not endure. All shall soon return to nothingness. That which hath been and shall ever be lasting is the favor of God. Hold fast unto goodly deeds and manifest divine attributes, that all may inhale from you holy and sacred fragrances and turn towards the Friend. Beseech ye the exalted Lord that He may illumine all the peoples of the earth with the light of justice and transform oppression and transgression into equity. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. The Glory be upon you and upon those whom neither self nor passion hath prevented from God, the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the last and the first. This is what hath been sent down for the handmaidens of God, upon them be the Glory of God. In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O handmaidens of God in Alif and Shin! Rejoice in that the Wronged One remembers you from the prison with a remembrance that shall endure throughout the dominion of earth and heaven and shall be read by honored servants. Blessed is the handmaiden who heard, responded, and attained the remembrance of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Woe to the servant who turned away from God when He came with the truth through a sovereignty that encompassed what was and what shall be. How many a learned one was barred from the ocean of knowledge in the days of God, and how many a handmaiden drew near until she attained and drank therefrom in the name of her Lord, the Possessor of existence.</p>
<p>O handmaidens of God! The Wronged One of the world has turned toward you from the Most Great Prison and makes mention of you. Were you to discover the greatness of this station, you would attain unto the most great joy - a joy that the sorrows of the world could not alter, nor the clamor of nations prevent. Blessed have you been and shall ever be, for you have turned to the highest horizon and are occupied with the praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory. The whole world was created for the knowledge of God; nevertheless, all remain veiled while you, through His wondrous grace, have been blessed therewith. Speak in His Name, drink in His remembrance, and be gladdened by His mention. You are accounted as leaves of Paradise in the sight of God, speaking His praise and enkindled with His love. You have attained to that which most of the world’s learned ones have remained heedless of, and God, exalted be His glory, has confirmed you in such wise that you hear His utterance and hearken unto His call. One manifestation of the manifestations of His light shone forth upon the Mount, causing it to crumble, while He has manifested Himself continuously in these days unto His loved ones and continues to do so. The recipients of the manifestations of this Revelation have been and are the realities of human beings. Reflect, that you may discover this station and taste the sweetness of the divine utterance. Blessed are they that drink, and joy be to them that know. The glory of God rest upon you from God, the Revealer of clear tokens and the Sender down of verses.</p>
<p>The Sun of divine favor has shone upon all, and the river of merciful bounty flows particularly for each of the near ones and the sincere ones. Take and drink, for He is verily the Generous Giver. In these days God, exalted be His glory, bestowed a leaf upon the holy, blessed Leaf - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be offered up for her sake. Some who were present became troubled, and signs of vexation appeared from most of them. Therefore, a Tablet was sent down from the heaven of will and bounty. This servant mentions its contents so that all on earth may become aware of the establishment of the Temple of Justice upon the throne of utterance and may be enlightened. This is what was sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds. His word, exalted and mighty is He:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, to Him belong greatness and power</p>
<p>O My Leaf! Bear thou witness that there is none other God but Him, the One, the Single, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Furthermore, let all know and be illumined in this matter by the lights of the Sun of certitude: male and female have been and always will be equal in the sight of God. The Dawning-Place of the Light of the All-Merciful has, with a single effulgence, shed His radiance upon all. He created the females for the males and the males for the females. The most beloved of people before God are the most steadfast and the foremost in the love of God, exalted be His glory. Rejoice thou and give thanks for what God has given thee, whom We named Sarah in the Kingdom of Names. He is verily the Protector of every handmaiden and the Lord of every steadfast and upright servant. The glory of God be upon you all from the Wronged One, the Exile.</p>
<p>From this blessed Tablet it is evident and manifest that all stand at one and the same level before God. “Verily, the most honored among you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you.” They are distinguished from one another in the degrees of love, piety, obedience, good deeds and their opposites. In this regard, this exalted Word was repeatedly heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “The friends of God must be adorned with the ornament of justice, equity, kindness and love. As they do not allow the infliction of tyranny and oppression upon themselves, they must not allow it upon the handmaidens of God. Verily, He speaketh the truth and commandeth that which profiteth His servants and handmaidens. He is the Protector of all in this world and the next.”</p>
<p>As for your mention of Aqa Asadu’llah from the land of A. and Sh. and his mother, after this was presented, this exalted Word appeared from the Mother Book - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O Lion! We have mentioned thee before, and We have mentioned the servants who have believed, so rejoice thou in God, the Lord of the worlds. And We have mentioned thy mother who hath ascended unto her Creator and We have heard her cry. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. God hath forgiven her as a bounty from His presence and hath adorned her with the ornament of His beautiful remembrance. Blessed is she and blessed is every handmaiden who hath turned unto Him and hath testified to that whereunto God Himself hath testified: that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the Huquq, whatever that honorable one doeth is acceptable before the Throne. This matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and this is what the Tongue of Utterance spoke forth in the Kingdom of Knowledge - glorious and exalted be His majesty: “O My Name! Upon thee be My Glory! Permission hath been granted unto you to receive the Huquq and to dispense to the friends of God whatever you deem advisable. Though for some time, due to the world’s and the nations’ lack of capacity, the friends of God may be observed to be poor and in need, God beareth witness to their loftiness, elevation, wealth and independence, for these matters are counted as mere accidents while the essence remaineth unharmed. God willing, may the wealthy ones of the earth be enabled to fulfill that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Book of God. May Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali Khan be confirmed in the mention of God and in His service. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him. Verily, all the treasures of the earth cannot equal it.”</p>
<p>You wrote that the funds for Muhammad-Qabel-’Ali were given to Aqa Muhammad Khan, which is acceptable. Regarding arrival in the Land of Ta, what was written about the association, love and capacity of the friends of God - all these matters were presented before His Countenance. He said: “O My Name! Strive that the point of divine love may attract all and establish them upon the throne of unity. This matter takes precedence over all matters, and it is the remedy for the chronic ailments of the peoples of the world. We make mention of them and glorify them from this Most Exalted Station, and We give them glad tidings of what God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, has ordained for them. We bid them to act with righteousness and with that which befits My Name, the Most Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Pure, the Mighty, the Beloved.”</p>
<p>All the world endeavors to grasp at means that cause the appearance and exaltation of mention, and they strive and struggle in pursuit of it to such an extent that it bewilders the rational mind, while their objective is in truth seen to be like a mirage. Praise be to God that the loved ones of this age hold fast to a Cause the like of which has never been seen in the world. Therefore, all must arise to do that which is the cause and means of exalting the Word of God. No helper in this station has been or is more mighty and powerful than goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. God willing, may all render victory to God, exalted be His glory, through these pure, brilliant and mighty hosts. The actions of the predators of the age have not been and are not acceptable. All have come for union, not separation, and have been brought into being for harmony and unity, not discord and division. If they would act according to what God has commanded even for a short while, soon they would find themselves upon the carpet of rest, glory and bounty. A hundred thousand blessings upon those who act.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to make all aware of the traces and fruits of the Tree of Utterance. By the life of the Desired One! Whoever becomes aware will hold fast to the divine commandments with the utmost eagerness and yearning. And regarding what they wrote about ’A, it was presented before the Throne. This is what the Tongue of the Desired One has spoken.</p>
<p>O My Name! If one of the Afnan could settle in that land and oversee this Cause in all respects, that is, safeguard it in that same House, this would be nearer, more beloved and better than other arrangements. In their association and fellowship with the loved ones, they must not let go of wisdom. Let their entire endeavor be to arise in service to this Cause from the presence of the Truth. Let them acquire a modest house, and its means shall be provided from the True One, exalted be His glory. How excellent is this most exalted, most brilliant station! They should not seek for the house to be grand, for this is not the time for outward means. We have ordained for it that which the mindful cannot comprehend. Let them acquire just a modest place for now. At present the purpose is preservation, nothing more. Thereafter the matter is in His hands; He will manifest it as He wishes. If He deems it advisable, He will ordain its transfer, and this depends on the requirements of divine wisdom. If this matter cannot be achieved with spirit and fragrance, then a place must be designated urgently, either in that land or outside it, and none should be informed save his honor ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, and one other person. This matter is a divine trust with him and that other person. Should they intimate or hint at it to anyone, they would be deprived of this luminous garment and merciful ornament which is the preservation of trust. If the means which the servant has intended become available, transfer would be preferable. This matter too must remain concealed.</p>
<p>To his honor the Afnan, Aqa Siyyid A., upon him be all glory most glorious, it is being written by command that whatever that honored one indicates should be carried out. And regarding matters other than this, by command whatever is necessary for expenses and other things should be obtained from his honor the Afnan A. and H., upon him be all glory most glorious.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the ascension of the illumined leaf, the honored consort, upon her be all glory most glorious. News arrived and there was revealed concerning that exalted leaf and fruit of the Divine Lote-Tree that which nothing can equal. Truly the sorrow of separation from her dissolved one’s being. One passage revealed by the Supreme Pen concerning her is this exalted word - His word, exalted be His majesty: “The sign of union gave thee life in the former time, and the sign of separation caused thy death in the latter time.” And likewise He says - His word, exalted be His grandeur: “The exalted fruit truly melted in separation, therefore she is mentioned before God among the martyrs.” The reward for this deed is a prayer of visitation revealed by the Supreme Pen. On that night and day, whoever ascended was attired in the robe of forgiveness, and this bounty was specific to her, except for those souls who openly denied the rights of God and His verses.</p>
<p>Indeed there was revealed and shone forth from the heaven of merciful grace and the horizon of divine favor that from which the fragrance of eternity is inhaled and the sweet-scented breaths of life are diffused. Glorified be the Speaker, glorified be the Expositor, and glorified be the Giver, exalted be His grandeur and exalted be His dominion, there is no God but Him. Likewise mention was previously made of the ascension of his honor Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib and his honor Haji Mirza Kamalu’d-Din, upon them be the glory of God and His mercy and His favor, and specifically for each one, time after time, there was revealed from the heaven of grace that which truly had no equal. Blessed are they both! Would that I had been with them and had attained to that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke concerning them.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of his honor Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. News concerning him hath arrived from all directions. From the Land of Kha numerous souls have addressed and dispatched letters directly to the Most Holy Court mentioning him and that which transpired in that land. Likewise, mention of him hath appeared in certain divine Tablets and letters of this servant that were sent to various regions. At one time this exalted Word was revealed from the tongue of the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven: “The Truth, the Strong, the Powerful, gave refuge to Mirza in that which came to pass and became the cause of the exaltation of the Word.” Smiling, He said: “Had it been otherwise, it would have been considered contrary to wisdom and deserving of punishment.” Although this too was to his advantage, for since execution must needs be carried out in person, therefore prior to its execution the command of attainment unto His presence was established, and afterwards grace and bounty were also present, that perchance He might grant pardon. Moreover, his honor hath witnessed the waves of the ocean of mercy and the outpourings of the sun of grace. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>As to what ye wrote concerning Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Glory of God, in truth the matter is as ye have written. He is excellent in teaching the Cause, for some time ago a word was heard from the Ancient Tongue indicative of this most exalted station. Excellent is he in all conditions. After your aforementioned words were presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this exalted Word - glorified and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>“O My Name! Praise be to God that Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be My Glory, hath arisen to serve and is adorned with the ornament of teaching. He hath been and shall ever be assisted in all conditions. That which your honor hath deemed advisable regarding his affairs hath been accepted before the Wronged One, for this matter hath verily added and continueth to add to his station. In truth his property, that is his possession, is accounted as being in the path of God. Exalted is this lofty station! Through its sale, freedom was attained, and through freedom that which God desired was made manifest. Blessed is he! O My Name! Blessed be his father who drank the wine of steadfastness from the hand of his Lord’s bounty and was among those endowed with certitude in a perspicuous Book. His station with God is most great. Blessed be they that are endowed with understanding, and blessed be they that visit his shrine. He is among those whose mention We have veiled due to the weakness of the servants. Convey My glad-tidings unto his son and My greetings from the Wronged One, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Generous. Divine favors will assuredly be directed towards him and will reach the detached ones. He is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful. Not an atom of good deeds hath been or ever shall be lost in the sight of God. Whoso pondereth upon former ages will witness that which the Tongue of the Wronged One hath witnessed in this noble station.”</p>
<p>This evanescent one hath also been assisted in these days, through the grace and favor of God, exalted be His glory, to send a reply to his honor, adorned with the mention of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne. God willing, may they attain unto the divine verses and drink from the oceans of their meanings. Verily His grace hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. That which reached the late and elevated his honor Haji Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy - at this moment He said that all rights incumbent upon him, both past and present, have been discharged and adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Praise be to God in all conditions. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth whatsoever He pleaseth and giveth as He desireth. He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding Jinab-i-Mulla Asadu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, what was written was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. These sublime words and manifest verses have descended from the heaven of bounty of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and are being sent written in the hand of the Branch of God - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps. His exalted Word states:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>We have desired to make mention of him who has turned to the Supreme Horizon when the learned and mystics turned away, save whom God, the Lord of Lords, willed. This is the Day wherein the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary is raised, and the river of inner meanings and utterance flows. Blessed is he who has drunk and attained, and woe unto the misguided ones who have cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed the manifestations of fancy and vain imaginings. Arise in the name of thy Lord Who remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison, then rend asunder the veils of the peoples. Say: By God, this is the Day of Reckoning wherein the Mother Book doth call aloud. Say: O concourse of the earth! Fear God and deny not Him at Whose appearance appeared that which was hidden in God’s knowledge and recorded in the Scriptures and Tablets. Beware lest the books of the world hold you back from the Lord of Eternity, or the affairs of the world veil you from turning to the Supreme Horizon, or the clamor of the learned sadden you. Arise with joy and radiance in the name of God, the Lord of Religions, and say: We have turned unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, and have set our faces toward Thy countenance, O Thou the Sovereign of verses. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the Tablet with the lights of utterance. Blessed is he who hath taken hold and woe unto him who hath violated God’s covenant on the Day of Separation. Arise to serve the Cause, then speak forth by this Name whereby skins have quivered and pillars have quaked. We have heard thy mention, have made mention of thee, and have sent down for thee that from which the sincere ones shall inhale the fragrance of eternity throughout ages and centuries. When thou attainest unto My Tablet and findest from it the fragrance of My utterance, arise and say: I testify to that whereunto the Tongue of Thy power hath testified before the creation of Thy heaven and earth, that there is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Thou art the Stranger Who hath made known to the servants their Supreme Home and revealed to them that which draweth them nigh unto God in all conditions. And Thou art the Wronged One, the Prisoner, at Whose tribulations the denizens of the highest Paradise and the Kingdom of Names have lamented at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations unto him, and beseecheth the exalted True One to strengthen him to serve His Cause and enable him to voice His praise in such wise that the coldness of the world shall not affect him and the heat of divine verses shall ever increase the warmth of his love, that he may be remembered by the name of God and be known and renowned for the love of God. Verily, He strengtheneth whosoever turneth unto Him and uttereth His praise.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention you made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad Karim, upon him be the Glory of God, and his brothers and relatives, upon them be 96 [Baha’u’llah], and likewise his presence’s visit to that house at their request - these matters were presented before the Ancient Countenance. This is what the Tongue of Power and Might uttered in His Kingdom. His exalted Word states: […]</p>
<p>In the name of Him Who domineth all names!</p>
<p>The honored Karim and his kinsmen have been and are remembered in the Most Holy Court. The grace of God - exalted be His glory - hath encompassed them, for they hearkened unto the Call and were adorned with the lights of certitude. Whatsoever they accomplished in the path of God hath been mentioned before the Divine Countenance and recorded in the Book by the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they who have honored thy resting-place and seized the opportunity of attaining thy presence in the love of God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings unto the honored Rahim and his brothers. Say: O Rahim! Behold thy ardor and the fragrance of thy acceptance. We have verily strengthened thee and raised thee to a station wherein thou didst witness the Most Great Sign and didst hearken unto the call of thy Most Glorious Lord. Forget not this lofty station and be not heedless thereof. I swear by the Most Great Luminary! Whoso in this Day remaineth even slightly heedless of the remembrance and service of God shall ere long be seized with remorse and regret. Praise be to the Goal of all creation Who enabled thee to attain that which hath been revealed and recorded by the Supreme Pen in the books of the past and present. God willing, mayest thou ever remain mindful of this station and preserve it through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. The glory of God rest upon them from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Some time ago this servant sent a response to the letter of Muhammad-Qabil-i-Karim which he had written to him who beareth the Name of Jud, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. That letter contained divine verses wherein the ocean of His grace and bounty was surging. God willing, may they attain unto it and be assisted in that which God desireth.</p>
<p>As to their intention to undertake the journey, if it can be accomplished with joy and fragrance - that is, if the means for it can be easily arranged - there is no objection. Otherwise, nay. In the previous year, two of the friends of God in that land, namely the land of T, were blessed with special favors, though outwardly prevented from turning to the Most Holy Court. Nevertheless, their deed and visitation were accepted at the threshold of the Divine Throne, and repeatedly were words of acceptance concerning them heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, and they attained that which causeth this servant to utter “Would that I had attained unto that which they attained!” Unto God belongeth the command, in the past and in the future, and He is the Commander, the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>And as to the mention they made of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali K D, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise the mention of Aqa Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God - praise be to God, they have been and are blessed with divine favors, as are their kinsmen. God willing, may they be occupied at all times with the service of the Cause and exert mighty efforts to exalt the Word. Thereby shall their stations, ranks and conditions be made manifest among the people. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>After presentation in the Most Holy Court, this most mighty Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace of the Lord of creation specifically for Akbar. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names![…]</p>
<p>A Book revealed by the Wronged One, wherein is that which draweth mankind nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who hath beheld the Most Sublime Horizon, and blessed is he who hath heard the Call when it was raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.” We have remembered those who have turned towards the Countenance and have revealed for them that wherefrom the sincere ones perceive the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. O Akbar! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the precincts of His Most Luminous Spot with verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of the earth. To this testifieth every discerning knower. This is a Day wherein the Ark of the Bayan hath sailed upon land and sea, and the tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken in the kingdom of utterance that which hath enraptured the hearts of them that are nigh. Blessed is he who hath forsaken the world out of love for God, the Lord of the ancient days, and hath acted according to that which was commanded in His perspicuous Book. This is a Day wherein the proof hath been perfected, the bounty completed, and the heavenly table sent down, yet the people remain behind a thick veil. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance and hath rent asunder the veils of them that are in the contingent world, in the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Thus have We illumined the hearts of the sincere ones with the lights of utterance, and We are verily the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>God willing, may they be illumined by the lights of the Sun of Utterance of the All-Merciful and engage in the remembrance of the Beloved of all possibility with utmost joy and delight. The servant sendeth greetings upon him and upon those who have believed in God in His Great Day. That which your honor had written regarding the Land of M and likewise concerning the delivery of items and trusts - all is beloved and accepted in the Most Holy Court. Everything from the gracious one is gracious. God willing, the previous correspondences will reach your honor, for they were bearers of wondrous and exalted verses from the presence of Truth. Furthermore, this evanescent one, who is as nothing, conveyeth greetings and salutations to all the gentlemen, friends, chosen ones and pure ones of God, and beseecheth from God, exalted be His glory, that He may enable all to attain unto that which beseemeth His days. This is not difficult for Him. And may the glory that shineth and beameth forth from the horizon of the heaven of the grace of our Lord, our Goal and your Goal, be upon your honor and upon those who have been just in the Cause of God and have attained unto the recognition of His wondrous Day. Praise be to God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>=== END BH00086 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00087 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise, glory, gratitude and splendor be unto that most holy and transcendent Being, the Object of all desire, Whom the tyranny of oppressors, the rejection and opposition of the wayward, and the calumnies of slanderers failed to deter. His Will is sovereign and His Purpose prevails, to such extent that, without helper or assistant, He raised up His Cause in the prison of ’Akka, so that now in the assemblies of the kings of the world, ministers, divines and mystics, this mention has been and continues to be made, leaving all bewildered. Glorified be His dominion, magnificent His signs, and mighty His proof!</p>
<p>At all times I beseech the Self-Sufficing Lord to adorn His loved ones with the ornament of patience and tranquility, to illumine them with the light of patience and forbearance, and to cause them to supplicate that He may show kindness unto the kings - who are the manifestations of His power and majesty - and grant them success in distinguishing between the reformer of the world and its corrupter. Verily, He is the Helper, the Wise, the All-Knowing Teacher.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Your letters have repeatedly arrived, but the delay in replying rests upon your forgiveness. Your latest letter, dated the first of the month of Jim, brought fresh joy to this grieving heart. It has been said of old that the remembrance of friends gladdens the Friend. After its perusal, ascent was made to the supreme heights and the most exalted Kingdom, and it was presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings, attaining the honor of His attention. Thus speaks He, exalted be His glory, mighty His sovereignty, all-encompassing His proof and evidence:</p>
<p>“I am the Caller before the faces of all mankind from the prison of ’Akka!</p>
<p>“O thou who soarest in My atmosphere, who standest before My throne, and drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! Hear My call - verily there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O spiritual youth! The Point announced unto the people the establishment of Him Who conversed on Sinai upon the throne of Manifestation. Yet when He appeared and was established, mankind turned away, save those whom God, the Lord of the mighty throne, willed.</p>
<p>“Say: O people, fear God! He Who was promised hath come, He Who was hidden hath appeared, He Who was treasured hath been made manifest. Through His appearance the call hath been raised from every direction: ‘The Revelation is God’s, the Kingdom is God’s, the Greatness is God’s, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Beautiful!’</p>
<p>“Say: Hath the eye of creation beheld the like of what hath appeared in truth? Have ears heard the like of what hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty? Nay, by the Self of God, Who standeth over the Cause with manifest sovereignty!</p>
<p>“Say: O concourse of men! Cast away what ye possess and take what ye are commanded in the Tablet. Verily it will preserve you, exalt you, and bring you near unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>“Say: Raise your heads from the couch of heedlessness. The Sun hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of bounty, and the ocean of grace surgeth in the name of your Lord, the Most Glorious. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the bounty of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>“Say: Will vain imaginings profit you? Nay, by His very Self, the Truth! Will idle fancies guide you? Nay, by His Name, the Mighty, the Great! Shatter the idols by the name of the Lord of Days. Verily He will deliver you through grace and save you from grievous torment.</p>
<p>“The people of the Bayan have taken for themselves what the former people took. Thus have their souls enticed them and made them among the most lost. Say: He hath come, for Whom the near ones sacrificed themselves in His path, and He hath appeared Who was mentioned in God’s Books, yet most people remain heedless. We have sent down to them from the heaven of bounty that which cooleth the eyes of the mystics.[…]”</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! God, exalted be His glory, hath manifested Himself in such wise that no possessor of hearing or sight hath denied or will deny Him. Without armies or legions He hath aided His Cause–an aid that is now celebrated and renowned in every gathering and assembly. Exalted be His might and His power! There is none other God but Him.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! We have effaced discord and strife from the Holy Books and have established the Cause of God with justice upon the throne of manifestation. Glory be to God! Strange it is that while all the people of the Bayan became aware of the tyranny, infidelity, polytheism and hypocrisy of the former party, yet some have again clung to the fabricated tales and false utterances of that people. Woe unto them, then woe unto them for having taken their vain imaginings as lords beside God! They are indeed among the oppressors in My manifest Book.</p>
<p>We make mention of the loved ones in that land–a mention that enkindleth and causeth detachment. O thou who art immersed in the ocean of My love! Reflect upon divine power and the influence of His Word. His Cause hath been aided and exalted from the earliest days until now, standing manifest and eloquent before all faces. The clamor of the ignorant divines of Persia who have appropriated unto themselves the name of knowledge, and the tumult of the common folk of that land, did not prevent the Lord of creation from revealing His Cause. In all conditions He hath spoken this most exalted Word: “The Lord of all being hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>Say: O people of God! Have ye heard the call and remained patient, or were ye among the heedless? O hosts of God! Have ye perceived the fragrance of God and remained tranquil, or were ye among the negligent? In most of Our Tablets We have made mention of what is meant by the hosts, that the world might be preserved from corruption and strife. In this most great Revelation, the banner of divine favor and the standard of preexistent mercy have been raised high. The divine hosts are goodly character, and His armies are praiseworthy deeds.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Although in this year the calumnies of the calumniators and the oppression of the oppressors have encompassed from every direction, yet through God’s grace and bounty the greatest joy hath been manifest and visible at all times. The cause of this is the adherence of the loved ones to the firm handle of divine commandments. From the time of Our arrival in Iraq, We forbade all from strife, conflict, corruption, murder and plunder. For nearly forty years no one hath transgressed God’s command. In every land, the oppressors of the world have inflicted upon the people of God that which caused the solid rock to weep and the hearts of the faithful to be consumed. Whatever befell them, they held fast to the cord of patience and clung to the hem of resignation. They were slain but slew not. The proof of this are the events that occurred in the lands of Sad [Isfahan], Kha [Khurasan], Ta [Tehran] and other cities. Blessed are they who are enraptured with love! The oppressors of the world perpetrated in that land what no oppressor had ever perpetrated, yet the people of God did not retaliate. Rather, they interceded for their oppressors and murderers. Well is it with them and may they rejoice! We beseech God to assist them to achieve unity and harmony. Nevertheless, the learned ones have not become aware. Say: My God, my God! Purify Thy servants from the stench of oppression.</p>
<p>O Ali! Rejoice in what hath appeared before thee from the horizon of My Most Great Prison. The tyranny of the oppressors hath failed to shut out from thee the lights that shine from the dawning-place of revelation. By My life! The Most Great Ocean hath appeared with its waves, wherein thou canst find the pearls of wisdom and utterance if thou art of them that understand. O Ali! The wrongs which I suffer have wiped from Mine heart every trace of sorrow, and have made manifest the splendors of the light of My Lord. Rejoice in My joy and be not of them that doubt. The World hath been illumined with the splendors of this Revelation. Blessed is he who hath recognized it and turned unto it with a sound heart. Say: He Who is the Eternal Truth hath appeared. He verily is the Promised One whose advent the scriptures of the past have heralded. Blessed are they that have believed in Him and woe betide such as have turned away […]</p>
<p>O Ali! Has the rapture of thy Lord’s utterance seized thee? Hast thou drunk the choice wine of detachment from the hand of His bounty, or art thou of them that linger? We beseech God to adorn thee with the most great profit in this trade wherewith the Concourse on High is occupied, to illumine thy head with the crown of fidelity, and to make thee among the horsemen in the arena of wisdom and utterance on this Day wherein He Who conversed on Sinai hath been established upon the throne of Revelation, to the dismay of every doubtful scholar and every remote mystic. Say: O people of the Bayan! Adorn your heads with the crown of the remembrance of Him Who heralded Me. His word is the truth, and I have written a gem concerning His remembrance: He shall not be known through My allusions nor through what was revealed in the Bayan. Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye seek proof through what ye possess. By God’s life! The books of the world shall profit you not this day save through this Book that walketh and speaketh. He is God; there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: Neither the promptings of the Guide nor of the Mahdi who spoke that which caused the dwellers of the pavilions of grandeur and majesty to lament in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, shall deliver you. Say: The Herald gave you glad tidings and informed you, saying “All the Bayan is as a ring upon His finger.” Ye have cast the command of God behind your backs. What aileth you, O company of wrong-doers? Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this exalted station. Light and spirit and glory be upon you, O party of God, from this time until such time as the sun shall continue to shine from the horizon of the will of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>
<p>This was revealed for His Honor Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the ocean of bounty surged!</p>
<p>O Hasan! Upon thee be My glory! The verses of God have encompassed the world, and from the clouds of bounty, in place of rain, the pearls of wisdom and utterance have showered down. The Call of Sinai is raised high, proclaiming “The Revelation hath appeared!” Yet the embodiments of imitation and the daysprings of limitation are deprived and forbidden from all the outpourings of the Day of God. The deniers of the Bayan are a thousand times greater than the deniers of the Qur’an. They behold power yet deny it, they hear the verses yet turn away from them. The ocean is manifest before all faces, yet those heedless souls, lacking sight, seek right and left that perchance they might find some fetid pool to which they might cling. The ocean needeth its fish, and the sky its soaring eagle. The lizard was not and is not capable of plunging into the sea. Say: O people of the Bayan! Look with justice and fairness and speak. If this Most Great Revelation be denied, none shall be able to establish proof of any Manifestation. This clear Cause and this mighty Announcement bear witness to that. Glory be from Us upon Our loved ones who have taken hold of the Book of God with such power that the might of all who are in the heavens and earth hath failed to prevent them.</p>
<p>Every fair-minded one hath testified to the inability of servants to reckon the grace and loving-kindness of God, exalted be His glory. At all times there hath descended from the heaven of divine verses that which is the cause of the life of the peoples of the world. Yet most nations are heedless and unaware. For the sake of two days of earthly life they have forsaken everlasting life and eternal blessing. Fie upon them and their understanding! It behooveth Me to recite in this place what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an through His words, exalted be He: “Leave them to plunge in vain discourse and play.” And let us cleave to the remembrance of the loved ones before the countenance of the Lord of all humanity, that there may be sent down for each one of them that which shall endure as long as His names and attributes endure. Verily, He is the Compassionate, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for His Honor Ahmad who attained the presence and won the victory - His word, exalted be His proof and mighty His evidence and glorious His verses […]</p>
<p>In the name of Him through Whom the light hath shone forth from the horizon of the world! This is the Day whereon the Mother Book hath, in the Kingdom of Utterance, been enthroned upon the seat of knowledge, proclaiming: O peoples of the earth! Fear God, and follow not those who have disbelieved in His proof when it appeared, who cast aside His verses when they were sent down, His evidence when it was perfected, His mercy when it preceded all else, and His grace when it encompassed all things. Thus hath the gate of counsel been opened. Blessed is the soul that hath hearkened and attained, and woe unto every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hath turned and attained, and hath drunk the choice wine of knowledge from the cup of the All-Merciful’s grace time and again. We have remembered him in diverse Tablets with a remembrance whose fragrance shall not cease so long as the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praised, shall endure.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We have raised up the Cause with a sovereignty that hath conquered the world and have revealed that which lay hidden before the faces of the nations. Among them are those who denied, those who turned away, those who disbelieved, and those who hearkened, turned towards God and said: “Praise be unto Thee for having manifested Thyself, O Thou God of all who are in the heavens and on earth!” Take thou the Most Great Key in My Name, then unlock therewith the doors of hearts through My remembrance, the Mighty, the Wise. Thou hast attained unto that which perisheth not, as doth testify the Lord of all beings in His mighty prison.</p>
<p>We have enjoined upon the servants trustworthiness, godliness, truthfulness and faithfulness, yet they have wrought that which hath caused the Most Exalted Pen to lament, save those whom God, the All-Merciful, the Gracious, hath willed. Glorify in My name the faces of My loved ones, remind them of My verses, and illumine them with the light of My knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee, upon those with thee, and upon those who have hearkened and responded to their Lord, the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>[Note: This appears to be the first portion of a longer text that continues with additional sections addressed to other individuals]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The Book hath been sent down in truth unto him who hath turned towards the Straight Path of God. O Ba’, hearken unto the call from the precincts of ’Akka. Verily there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come with a Cause before which the hosts of the heavens and earth cannot stand. When thou drinkest the choice wine of divine knowledge from the goblets of thy Lord’s bounty, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having revealed unto me that which was hidden from Thy servants and acquainted me with that which was treasured in Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and by the lights of Thy countenance, O Lord of all beings, and by Thy Name at Whose utterance all names bow down, and by Thy light at Whose dawning all lights submit, to make me in all conditions one who gazeth toward Thy horizon, who speaketh Thy praise, and who aideth Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. I testify, O my God, to Thy oneness and Thy singleness, and to Thy mercy which hath preceded Thy servants and Thy creation. O Lord, I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Thou seest me clinging to Thy cord and hoping for the wonders of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art He through Whose command the names appeared and the letter Kaf was joined to its pillar, the letter Nun. There is none other God but Thee, the One Who ruleth over what hath been and what shall be.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Mirza Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name through which the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth! A remembrance from Our presence unto him who hath drunk the choice wine of knowledge in the days of God, the Lord of the Day of Return. We have turned toward him from the precincts of the Prison and have revealed for him that whereby the realities of all things were attracted in this Day wherein the Herald hath proclaimed from the precincts of ’Akka: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords. O Muhammad-’Ali, give thanks unto God for having aided thee, drawn thee nigh, and given thee to drink of the pure water from the hand of the grace of the Lord of the Day of Manifestation, and guided thee unto this Cause whereby feet have slipped save for those whom God, the Lord of mankind, hath willed. Counsel My servants on My behalf and remind them of My verses, then read what We have revealed unto thee with joy and fragrance. This is a day wherein hearts have melted and servants have lamented by reason of what hath befallen the Wronged One at the hands of those who have denied His proof and His evidence, and have violated that which they were bidden in the Mother Book. Say: Fear God, O company of the heedless! By God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment hath come with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in earth and heaven. Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for thee that whereby the hearts of such servants as have heard and responded were attracted - these are they who, in the sight of God, the Lord of all beings, are among the people of this station. Take the Book by My command and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, for having aided me to turn toward Thee and remembered me through that whereby the fragrance of the garment hath wafted throughout all lands. O Lord, Thou seest the ocean of poverty desiring the ocean of Thy riches, and it beseecheth Thee by Thy Most Great Name through which Thou hast subdued the nations, to send down upon me from the clouds of Thy grace and the heaven of Thy bounty that which shall render me detached from all except Thee and holding fast unto Thee and unto Thy verses and unto all that hath appeared from Thee. O Lord, weakness hath seized me in Thy days. I beseech Thee to make me strong through Thy strength and mighty through Thy might. Verily Thou art He unto Whose sovereignty every tongue hath testified, and to Whose greatness and power every one possessed of understanding hath borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Mirza Davud, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name through which the horizon of utterance hath been illumined! […]</p>
<p>O David! The verses of God are being revealed from every direction, and His evidences are pouring forth like rain from the clouds of grace. That which was hidden is now manifest, and the Speaker of the Mount is speaking without veil or covering before all faces. The Psalms are being chanted and the call is raised from the highest horizon. Blessed is the one whom the wall of Gog did not prevent - and these Gog are the divines of Persia who from the earliest days until now have prevented the servants from the Law of God. Blessed is the soul whom their clamor did not hinder, whose strength their might did not weaken, and whom their dominion did not frighten. These are servants whose mention God has revealed in His Books, His Psalms and His Tablets. O David! God willing, through the power and might of the Truth, exalted be His glory, thou shalt rend asunder the veils of the heedless and give unto all the glad tidings of the Great Announcement, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the ocean of bounty. Strive thou, and beseech God that He may not prevent His servants from the outpourings of His days. He is the Forgiver of sins, and He is the Transformer of hearts. We have mentioned thee before and made known unto thee the path of God, the Lord of the House and the Possessor of this lofty station. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have testified to that which God hath testified and who have acknowledged that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen in His mighty and wondrous Book.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad-Amin, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Amin! Upon thee be My manifest glory. Blessed is the soul that is illumined by the light of trustworthiness and adorned with the ornament of faithfulness. In most Tablets We have commanded the servants to perform good deeds and display praiseworthy conduct, but some heeded not the divine counsel and clung to their own desires, and there befell the temple of trustworthiness from heedless and oppressive souls that which caused the eye of justice to weep. This Wronged One hath, during the nights and days, counseled the servants of God concerning that which would draw them nigh and profit them, yet defiled ears attained not unto hearing. Strange, nay most strange, that they remain heedless of that which profiteth them and cling to that which harmeth and destroyeth them. Ere long shall the carpets of the world be rolled up, and the embodiment of justice shall be established upon the throne of equity, and the station of the blessed words “Give unto each his due” shall become manifest and evident. We beseech God to illumine all through the lights of the Day-Star of Justice and to sever them from aught else beside Him. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have held fast unto the cord of counsel from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Ya’qub-’Ali, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>In My Name, through Whose light the earth and heaven were illumined […]</p>
<p>O Jacob! The Joseph of God dwelleth in the well of the oppressors, and at every moment there befalleth Him that which causeth the people of the cities of justice and equity to lament. We commanded trustworthiness, yet they clung to treachery; We enjoined equity, yet they embraced tyranny. Through what they possess they remain heedless and veiled from what is with God. Do they not see that they die and dwell in their tombs? Do they not see that they depart and return not? Glory be to God! Heedlessness hath reached such a state that pen and ink are powerless to describe it. They waited for My days, but when they came they turned away and pronounced against Me a grievous judgment. Their vain desires have prevented them from drawing nigh unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We beseech God to assist thee and His loved ones to champion His Cause through wisdom and utterance, and to strengthen you with the hosts of goodly deeds and virtuous character. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy devoted servants amidst Thy rebellious ones, and beholdest the wolves surrounding Thy loved ones. I beseech Thee by the lights of the Sun of Thy knowledge and by the mysteries deposited in Thy Tablets to enable them to return unto Thee, to draw near to the court of Thy nearness, and to stand before the door of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath removed our grief, manifested unto us His signs, and sent down upon us His favors. The heavenly food and the bounty of utterance descendeth at all times. We implore God to assist His servants that they may attain unto it and not be deprived. O Thou in Whose hand is grace and bounty! Have mercy on Thy servants with the mercy that hath preceded existence, then unveil unto them through Thy generosity, O Loving One, that they may turn to the lights of Thy countenance and seek shelter in the shadow of Thy care. I testify that Thou art the All-Bountiful in all conditions. There is no God but Thee, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Nuru’llah and ?iya’u’llah, upon them be the Glory of God. After its presentation in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these words were revealed from the Dayspring of the divine will. His mighty utterance and glorious proof proclaim:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Kind Friend</p>
<p>O Nuru’llah! In this hour when the Wronged One of the world walketh in the Most Great Prison, He hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee. We beseech God to water the saplings of the garden of divine knowledge with the rains of grace and bounty, that they may reach the station of maturity, which is the station of the appearance of fruits. He is the Hearer, the Answerer. God willing, thou shalt abide beneath the shadow of God’s special favor, glorified be His majesty, and be illumined by the lights of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Praise be to God, thy father attained the Most Sublime Vision and his presence was adorned with acceptance. He heard the Call on a day when most of humanity was prevented from hearing, and drank the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he, and blessed are those who are with you on this blessed, mighty, wondrous Day. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon every one who hath attained to this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for ?iya’u’llah, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In the Name of the One God</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Light! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names! Praise thou the Desired One of all worlds Who brought thee from nothingness into being and adorned thee with the ornament of existence in days for which there hath been no peer or likeness. Thou and the love of God have, in truth, come into being as twins. Blessed be the loins that have attained unto this wondrous remembrance. The gaze of divine favor hath ever been and will continue to be directed towards thee. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having illumined the hearts of them that have turned towards Thee with the light of Thy knowledge, and caused their tongues to speak Thy praise and glorification, and revealed unto them that which was hidden from most of Thy servants. O Lord! Draw them nigh through Thy bounty and grant them the Kawthar of Thy utterance. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, verily Thou art the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be the everlasting Glory of God! Convey to all the kindred and relatives the greetings from the Wronged One, and give them all the glad-tidings of the effulgences of the Day-Star of grace and bounty. Say: Blessed are ye for having attained unto the days of God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the exalted seat. We make mention of all the loved ones in that land. Say: O loved ones of God and His party! We beseech Him that He may cause to flow forth from you, in His name, that which shall endure throughout the perpetuity of His dominion. Blessed be ye, and His mercy be upon you. Ye are they whom neither the harm of the oppressors nor the opposition of the transgressors hath withheld. We counsel you to observe wisdom - wisdom being such deeds and actions as would cause the heedless ones of the world to become aware and draw them nigh unto the party of God. The helpless servants have been reared by the divines in vain imaginings. The wise ones of the earth must, with the utmost kindness and love, summon the people to the Law of God and the Dawning-Place of His favors. Should they become adorned with the ornament of awareness, all will circle round it.</p>
<p>O party of God! We beseech Him that He may manifest from you steadfastness - a steadfastness the like of which hath never been seen. The former people were deprived of the Dawning-Place of divine revelation through vain imaginings and doubts. They considered themselves the most profitable of all the world, yet on the Day of Manifestation they were seen to be the most lost. Say: God protect us and you, O party of God, from their vain imaginings and doubts, and from their deeds and actions and words and beliefs. For had their deeds and beliefs been in harmony, they would surely have attained recognition and been blessed with the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. It hath been repeatedly mentioned that the recompense of the deeds of that tyrannical group deprived them of the Dawning-Place of divine justice and the Source of His mercy. The false tales of old prevented the people from the Most Great News which was mentioned in the divine Books of the past and future.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid them to return unto Thee and to make good what they missed when the Sun of Thy Revelation shone forth. All created things have testified to Thy grace and all contingent beings to Thy mercy. Deprive not Thy servants of the ocean of Thy bounty, from whose waves can be heard: The kingdom and the dominion belong unto God, the Lord of the worlds. The Glory shining from the horizon of Revelation be upon you, O loved ones of God and His friends, upon your first and your last, your outward and your inward being, and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>
<p>Concerning what was mentioned about prayer, the prayer whose ordinance was revealed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, that prayer along with many other sacred writings was sent from the prison to another location. And the new prayer that was later revealed - its recitation depends on times when one observes a certain state within oneself. In truth, it hath been revealed in such wise that were it to be recited upon a rock, that rock would stir and speak forth, and were it upon a mountain, it would move and flow. Blessed is he who reciteth it and is among those who act. The recitation of either prayer sufficeth. Should one observe with justice and fairness any verse of its verses or any word of its words, he would pass beyond his own understanding and that of the people, and fix his gaze upon that which is with God.</p>
<p>As for what ye mentioned concerning the slaughtered animal that hath died, its ruling is as before. Thus hath the Lord decreed at this time. And concerning what was asked about the heavens and the stars, this hath already been revealed by the Supreme Pen regarding these matters - there is no need for repeated mention. And regarding the permission for pilgrimage about which ye wrote, after this firm decree was presented, this utterance was manifested from the tongue of grandeur: whenever the means are available and wisdom requireth it, they may make the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of Aqa Mirza Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy that precedeth all, after these shining words were presented, there dawned from the horizon of will these words - exalted and blessed be He: “O spiritual youth! Praise be to God Who aided thee to fulfill what was incumbent upon thee according to God’s decree, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad tidings of the acceptance of his deed. We beseech God to open before his face the gates of grace and bounty, and to ordain for him that which shall be a light unto him and shall go before his face in all the worlds of God. Verily He is the Protector of those who have believed in Him and have acted according to what they were commanded in His perspicuous Book.” He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. […]</p>
<p>The Book speaks before the faces of the parties and says: O concourse of earth! Know ye the value of the Day of God, and deprive not yourselves of His infinite bounties. This Day has no peer or likeness. The bounty of utterance and the banquet of knowledge have descended from the heaven of the favor of the Beloved of all possibility. Blessed is the soul that has turned and attained, and woe unto the heedless! O Husayn! After this, the Lord of all beings has turned toward thee from the prison quarter and makes mention of thee. In the estimation of those endowed with insight and the denizens of the most exalted Paradise, the riches of the world and the treasures of nations cannot equal this mention. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and glory be unto Thee, O Glory of those who are in the heavens and on earth! Your handiwork has been presented and has attained the glance of favor. Reflect upon the sublimity of the ocean of divine grace. By My life! All the things of the world were and are unworthy of mention in the Holy Court, but as your handiwork has appeared through love and you have sent a spiritual youth, it has been adorned with the ornament of mention by the One Who is the Goal of all beings and illumined with the light of acceptance. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Wise. Praise be unto Him, as He is the Beloved of the mystics and the Goal of the sincere ones. The ocean of bounty has appeared with waves upon waves. A single atom of deeds that have appeared and do appear in His path stands forth in His presence as lofty as the heavens. Can anyone enumerate this bounty? Nay, by His manifest sovereignty! Although the thanksgiving and praise of this servant do not and will not reach the hem of this blessing, unless His grace takes hold and His mercy accepts. Every created thing has testified to His loftiness, His transcendence, His grace, His giving, His favor, and His bounty. There is no God but He, the Forgiving, the All-Merciful, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I make mention of the loved ones of that land, both young and old, and hope from the grace and mercy of the sovereign Who doeth as He willeth that in those regions the light of submission and contentment may shine forth and all may attain unto that which hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will in the holy Tablets. In truth, that which is obligatory today according to His command is that all should hold fast to such deeds as will attract the people of the earth. I beseech Him to assist and enable all to do that which they have been commanded in the Book. Verily, He is the Generous, the Possessor of great bounty. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Glory and mention and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon everyone who has turned, recognized, and attained unto this wise Remembrance and this mighty Command.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>27 Ramadan 1307</p>
<p>=== END BH00087 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00088 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds!</p>
<p>The letter sent hath reached the Most Holy Court and its contents were observed. Praise be to God that in this Morn of the All-Merciful thou hast been illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of divine knowledge. Yet beseech thou the True One, exalted be His praise, that thou mayest ever remain adorned with the ornament of His love and sanctified from all else, for verily the divine Cause in this Manifestation of celestial might is most great, nay, greater than all that is great, and more magnificent than all that standeth and endureth. Naught is seen therein save the mystery of Divine Unity and pure Oneness. We beseech God to open the eyes of all humanity that they may recognize Him and bear witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever existed in the unity of His Essence, sanctified from all else, and will continue to exist in the sovereignty of His Self, exalted above the mention of aught besides Him, His Being transcendent above the description of all created things, His Identity unique beyond the attributes of all existence, His Reality holy beyond the praise of all who dwell on earth and in the heavens. His is the Command and Creation in all beginnings and endings, and verily He is the Lord of all names and attributes, the Establisher of verses and the Obliterator of allusions. Blessings and peace be upon Him Who sat upon the throne of power and majesty, through Whom the veils of glory were rent asunder, Who is exalted above all forms and likenesses, Who giveth to drink the pure water of paradise and banisheth the people of error in both beginning and end, and upon those who turned unto Him and shattered the idols of vain imaginings and hopes, and entered the pavilion of grandeur and grace, upon whose faces appeared the radiance of God, the Mighty, the Sublime.</p>
<p>God willing, through the Supreme Remedy and the Most Great Elixir, inner maladies shall be healed and brought to equilibrium. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>As to thy question regarding the saying of Maria, the essence of Maria’s work concerneth the white and red gums, and the red gum is derived from the white gum. Whoso findeth this hath attained the ultimate goal. This is the meaning of Our saying: “Were it not for the moon, the sun would not exist, and were it not for silver, gold would not exist.” By silver We meant the white earth, which is the white gum, and from it We brought forth gold, which We termed the red gum. This is the philosophers’ gold and their sulfur, and the tawny egg, and it hath names beyond counting which none hath discovered save him who possesseth knowledge of the Book. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, and in His grasp are the keys to the treasuries of all things. He giveth unto whom He willeth and withholdeth from whom He willeth. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning her statement about taking from the branch of the stone and not from its root, nor from the stone itself, and so forth, know that the purpose in this noble art is the knowledge of the honored stone, and taking from its branch is contingent upon recognition of the root of the stone. Whosoever becomes cognizant of the root will be free and independent of such mentioned practices, for they will be capable of mighty works. All the sages have concealed the root of the stone - either omitting the beginning, the end, or the middle - and have not mentioned any practice in proper sequence. Whatever they have mentioned of outward practices has been to divert attention from the inward work. For the inward works, they have found examples in the outward and have mentioned them. These very mentions of outward things constitute the symbols, allusions, metaphors, and similes of the sages. For instance, they have mentioned gold, while intending the gold that exists in a specific mine. Due to the correspondence and similarity between inward gold and outward gold in color and nature, they have termed it “gold.” Since people have not understood the intent, they have spent years pursuing their own imaginings, living in regret and departing in regret, never attaining their goal. Their gold is gold, yet not gold; their silver is silver, yet not silver. Hence they said: “Our gold is not the gold of the common people,” and likewise for silver.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most people have wasted their lives in the darkness of outward practices and have not attained to the true dawn. Their mention of the inward refers to the fact that the four natures are concealed in a single thing which they have termed “the stone.” After differentiation, in the view of the discerning ones, this very inward becomes the outward. As long as the four natures remain concealed and undifferentiated in their inner mine, the term “inward” applies to it, and after distinction and differentiation in the outer realm, the name “outward” applies to it. At this station, the outward is identical to the inward, and the inward is the very outward. However, some sages have found things in the external world bearing close correspondence and similarity to the four natures and the sublime, ancient elements that are hidden and stored within the stone itself, and have mentioned these, calling them “outward,” as was briefly explained.</p>
<p>The intended meaning of “ancient” here refers to temporal precedence, not essential pre-existence, for it is preceded by a cause. Exalted is He above any association of eternity with origination! We testify that the very eternity comprehended by those drawn nigh and the sincere ones is itself originated in His presence. He has ever been sanctified beyond mention of eternity or origination, and He is holy beyond mention and description. Whatever He hath named Himself of names and attributes is from His grace upon all creation. Exalted is the All-Merciful above what is ordained in contingent existence, for He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Know, O seeker, that the essential purpose is the knowledge of the Stone and the elaboration of what lies hidden within it, its purification and its marriage. The Stone itself must be purified through the aid of the Stone itself and be elaborated, for if anything else intervenes, the temperament becomes difficult. Therefore, take the Stone and through Azrael extract from it the spirit and soul, then strive to purify it until through operative measures it becomes pure and clean from the intervening impurities that prevent. Then return what thou hast extracted to the body, that through the confirmation of Israfil, the spirit of that dead body may be quickened and thou mayest observe a new creation, whereupon thou shalt say: “Blessed be God, the Best of Creators!” For the body will not accept another spirit, nor will the spirit turn to another body. This is the truth wherein there is no doubt.</p>
<p>This spirit and soul, though after elaboration they appear as two things, are in reality and essence united and are one thing. That which is extracted from the Stone hath been called by all names, meaning that in every station it is called by a name befitting that station. For example, before extraction from the mine it is called by certain names, and likewise after extraction and before purification by certain names, and after purification by other names. Similarly, in the stations of the manifestation of effect and action, in each station both spirit and soul and body are called by a name. For instance, the term “volatile,” which is inscribed in the books of the sages, refers to the dissolved water distilled from the Stone. This water they have mentioned as the water of sulfur, the water of alum, vinegar, serpent’s venom, wine, the fire of air, the water of air, and the like.</p>
<p>When it is said “water of air” and “fire of air,” this is a complete exposition - shouldst thou comprehend it, thou wilt be independent of the work of all who dwell upon earth. Air possesseth two pillars: fire and water, that is, moisture and heat. This divine water, before acquiring oiliness from sulfurous earth, is called the water of air, for moisture predominates therein. And after this first distillate, which is water and air, acquires fieriness from the second distillate, the element of fire hidden within it becomes manifest, whereupon it is called the fire of air. These two supreme pillars, which are in truth the active agents, are made manifest from air. Glorified be He Who hath suspended colors therein, and in it is a treasure at which the minds of the wise are bewildered.</p>
<p>In brief, all these mentioned names refer to the water dissolved from the Stone. Similarly consider the earth of the Stone and whatever else is extracted therefrom, each of which hath been called by many names. Different names have become the guardian of this divine treasure, that its reality might remain concealed from the ignorant and protected from treacherous souls. Some have abbreviated it to spirit, soul and body, naming it thus, while others have called the earth the Stone and what is extracted therefrom mercury and sulfur. And though this mercury and sulfur appear different and distinct in form, they are in reality united.</p>
<p>Know that sulphur and mercury, though outwardly they appear different and distinct, yet in reality they are united and are one essence and one being. For indeed, if there were no inner similarity and correspondence, natural dissolution - which is the ultimate degree of the first stage of liquefaction - would not occur. In such case amalgamation would be impossible. Know thou that amalgamation followeth dissolution, even as knowledge precedeth action.</p>
<p>O questioner! Strive to drink, through the grace of the All-Merciful, from the life-giving waters of wisdom and utterance that have flowed from the Most Ancient Pen and the Most Great Name, that you may attain your purpose. Now these mercury and sulfur, which have appeared from a single mine and are brother and sister, termed male and female - these two must be purified until the obstructing impurities are removed and they become capable of combining. The purpose of purification is to manage them such that their inner compatibility manifests outwardly, making them suitable for combination. For example, mercury’s outward moisture prevents its combination with sulfur. O wise one! Water and fire never combine, for water extinguishes and suppresses fire. These two are opposites and cannot combine. Therefore, the divine water which flows from the spring of the stone of divine wisdom, called volatile, must be managed until its outward moisture, which prevents combination with sulfuric fire, is removed and vanishes, and its inner heat, which shares affinity with sulfur, becomes manifest. In this case, combination is easy, for oil readily combines with oil, but water and oil never mix. So strive until the inner oil of mercury, which remains frozen and veiled due to dominant moisture, becomes manifest through practical management and unites with the sulfuric essence which is truly oil. The greatest cause of union and combination in this divine wisdom and divine craft is compatibility. O questioner! Reflect deeply that you may comprehend the truth and secrets that have flowed from the Chosen Pen. If you grasp their meanings, you will surely know that what has been mentioned is truth, and after truth there is naught but error and loss. And you will testify that the reins of all knowledge are in the grasp of the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen. Some have considered fire to be the key to this Most Great Treasure and Most Noble Secret, but the key of keys has been and will be the understanding and insight of those who act. For it is observed that most people take contradictory things that are outwardly and inwardly different and opposed, spending their lives trying to dissolve and combine these incompatible elements - this has been and will be impossible, for natural dissolution and true combination occur only through similarity and compatibility. The virgin secrets that were forever concealed in the divine preserving chambers have become manifest and evident. Perhaps God will thereby bring about a matter. O questioner! The appearance of every matter and the creation of every craft depends upon and is connected to the Cause of causes through causes. Ruby must be sought from its mine, and likewise the jewels of wisdom must be sought from their mine, which is the stone - you will not find it elsewhere though you search your whole life. Look to the causes, trusting in God, the Cause of causes. Verily He is the Opener of doors and the Lord of lords. O questioner! It has become clear that by divine water is meant not every water, but the water distilled from the honored stone.</p>
<p>O Lord of Lords! The inquiry has been understood. The intent of the divine water is not every water, but rather the water distilled from the honored stone. Though outwardly this water appears as water, inwardly it is fire. The term “water” is applied to it due to the moisture and coldness apparent in its exterior, while the name “fire” refers to the oiliness and sulfurous nature concealed within it. Thus these mercury and sulfur, though appearing as two, are in reality and essence one being. As for the stone itself, its origin is from water; it is artificial and active, bearing two mercuries, possessing two souls, manifesting two spirits, and its movement is its action which arises from its heat. Glory be to God! The root of the matter is from one thing, and though it is singular in its essence, it has manifested and been named with different natures, varying manifestations, multiple colors, and numerous names. Observe how the treasury and source of this matter is one - which is the stone - yet after differentiation it becomes three, as it is known that spirit and soul emerge from the stone. Nevertheless, in these tablets it has been given several names: in one instance mercury and sulfur, in another spirit and soul, likewise two mercuries, two souls, two spirits, the volatile one, and divine water. The source of all these multiplicities was one thing, and according to the requirements of the stages of preparation and extraction of colors and dyes, it was designated by a name. For example, in one place it was called mercury because it flies from fire; at times it was called water due to its moisture and coldness; and in another place it was mentioned as sulfur in reference to the sulfurous nature which is the substance of combustion concealed within it. In the stages of preparation, each manifests in every station with a color and effect, and accordingly is designated by a name. Therefore, you should not doubt the different names mentioned in the books, and know with certainty that the root of the matter and its source is one thing, called by countless names and manifested in multiple appearances. Similarly, they have named the stone and what emerges from it after the seven minerals which, in the terminology of the philosophers, are related to the seven planets. For instance, in one place they called it copper due to its color and slowness in melting, and when the body through preparation became quick to melt and was freed from darkness, it was called white lead, and when the tincture of the stone was sublimated by the power of dissolved mercury, they called it gold due to its balance, manifestation, color and brilliance - and it is the crown of crowns, yellow sulfur, the philosophers’ gold, the secret of secrets, and the most hidden secret. Whoever attains it has attained what they desired. Compare the remaining minerals similarly, and they have named them after the four humors - yellow bile, black bile, phlegm, and blood - which are the manifestations of the four natures in the human person. Therefore, ask God that you may attain, through the aid of the Universal Manifestation of the All-Merciful, to the mine of divine wisdom which is hidden in the noblest of the three kingdoms.</p>
<p>Behold the four tempers, which are the manifestations of the four natures in the human person! Entreat thou God that through the assistance of the Universal Manifestation of the All-Merciful, thou mayest attain unto the divine fountain of wisdom which lieth concealed in the most noble of the three kingdoms, and find thy way thereunto. O seeker! When thou hast reached thy goal, strive thou to be among the God-fearing and the thankful, for He is the Most Great Treasure and Bearer of the Honored Stone. Take from Him according to thy need and separate with dry fire, and after separation remove that which is dissimilar. When the dissimilar elements have been removed and the similar ones made ready, this is the station of the first marriage of the sages. Then wed this divine water, which is active and is spirit and male, to the sulphurous earth which is passive and female. After the passage of some time, an embryo will be formed, for as We have said, the Stone is manufactured, and it is the Hidden Treasure and the Treasured Secret. Then bring forth from the mother’s womb this luminous child which hath come into being through spiritual power and hath been formed from the two similar and compatible elements, namely mercury and sulphur. This is the time of purification, and if it be called the time of marriage, this too is true, but it is the time of dissolution. Understand thou, O wayfarer, the import of these words of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and know of a certainty that until this time the veils covering this most great science and this most ancient, most upright secret have never been thus removed, neither for the pure ones nor for the chosen ones. Say: Glorified be our Most Exalted Lord, Who hath appeared once again through His Most Glorious Name, whereby all who are in earth and heaven were shaken, save them who held fast unto the Strong and Luminous Cord that was suspended betwixt the realms of creation by the command of God, the Lord of Names.</p>
<p>Take this noble offspring, which is this prepared earth that has come into being from sulfuric fire and mercurial water, and mix it with a portion of dissolved mercury which is its essence and reality and is from its elemental realm. Place it in a gentle, moderate fire until some of that prepared earth is dissolved. Add water again until that tincture which is fire and oil and the reality of the soul emerges from the earth. God forgive me, permission is not given to say more than this. Some have been content with mercury alone, meaning they have detailed this mercurial solution which has become the bearer of the tincture and has concealed within itself the sulfuric reality by virtue of its genus. They have extracted from it the purified tincture, coagulated it, dissolved it, and completed the work. Whoever attains unto this has attained unto the Most Great Kingdom. This is the mercury that is [inscribed] in the books, and it is the most pure blood that has been called air and red sulfur. Although this tincture, which is the essence of the tincture of sulfur and arsenic, is in reality composed of spirit, soul and body and possesses the four natures, through its spiritual power it has taken from every element and united it with itself, and has no need of another element, for it bears the active essence and is itself the tincturing agent. For if it were not itself the tincturing agent, it would be impossible for it to become so through the arrangement of the tincturing agent. Yes, the special arrangement is for this precious, luminous essence which has appeared from the divine mine to become pure [and] cleansed of filth, blackness and external corrupting moistures that are immoderate and prevent the manifestation of its effect and action. It is the sign of divine conquest, therefore it has been called the crown of conquest, for it conquers all bodies. However, if the spirit and soul are arranged with their own pure and clean earth, which they have called white magnesia and the thirsty earth, it is more beloved and safer. But they do not mix directly and do not accept union, for this tincture, which has been called the moist soul and mineral sal ammoniac, was water and acquired oiliness from its earth and became air, and after absorbing moistures appeared in the form of fire which is the sulfuric reality, and was designated the dry soul. If you call it to the dry earth, surely the fire will melt the earth. In this case, natural solution and true temperament is difficult, for the thirsty earth deserves water - if you give it fire it will surely perish and never come alive again. Therefore you must give this dry earth to drink from the water which is from its element and is in reality its origin, reality and substance, so that the plant of divine wisdom may grow from this blessed earth. In brief, earth needs water, and likewise fire, for moisture is the nourishment of heat. Reflect that you may understand what is intended. When these two elements become moderate through the education of water, they will be capable of complete mixture, and this is the final stage of marriage and is the third marriage.</p>
<p>And this is the final stage of marriage, and marriage is threefold, and this is the second earth which is other than the first earth, and in truth it is its remainder and is the remaining earth called ash, and verily it is patient in the fire, neither anxious nor fleeing from it. Therefore nurture this tincture with virgin’s milk which is of its element and compatible with it, as was mentioned before, for if you give it incompatible nourishment it will perish instantly and will never reach the stage of maturity and development which is its station of influence, dominion and effect. And in truth this earth is dead until the spirit is sent forth, meaning it becomes alive and enduring. And in practice there is no need for tincture, and the earth must be waxed with spirit alone until it dissolves, and this must be repeated until it is complete and perfect. And if you feed the purified tincture to this waxed earth, the work of the sun is complete. And the other stages of waxing, dissolution and coagulation depend on the intelligence and wisdom of the worker and the manifestation of the effect - they have no connection with temporal and numerical limitations, for often after stages of waxing the effect has appeared with one dissolution and coagulation, and often it has exceeded three times, and the command is in God’s hand - He manifests it as He wishes. Or dissolve the original stone with divine water and mercurial key, and whatever was taken from it, return again gradually to the remaining earth lest it be drowned at once, and repeat this until all the pillars of spirit, soul and body are dissolved. And this is what was meant by “the stone has an inward path, and it is water in appearance and fire in nature, burning by its heat all that is in its nature.” Therefore place it in a gentle fire until the heat of the fire draws forth the moisture from these waters, and the fiery form which is concealed and hidden in the essence of these waters becomes manifest while the watery form becomes concealed. And when the inner oiliness becomes manifest, it must necessarily coagulate. Therefore dissolve and coagulate until it becomes active. And from this explanation which has flowed from the Pen of the Most Merciful, the hidden and concealed natural balance has become clear and evident, no longer needing external measures. If you understood what was mentioned, you would rejoice and find yourself possessing all the earth, and you would be certain that the keys of knowledge are in the grasp of the Sovereign of the Known, through Whom the veils of fancy were rent asunder. And verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. There is no God but He, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>And if you wish to obtain the essential agent from accidents and catch the divine Bird of Wisdom in the net of arrangement, then take the Stone and grind it with its water until that which is a tincture and quick to dissolve is dissolved in this Key Water which is mercury. Add more water until that which is dissolved ascends and appears on the surface of the water. This is the Supreme Oil, the Eastern Mercury, the True Air, the Divine Spirit, and the Two-Winged Gold which, by the power of its wings - namely the Key Water and elemental fire - has taken flight and ascended. But in truth the two wings are the two mightiest cornerstones, the two agents, and they are within its own essence. With these two wings it flies through all bodies. This is the Sea Physician, upon whose skill depends the health of all sick and ailing bodies, whether of land or sea or mineral. This is the manifestation of God’s name the Predominant, His name the Self-Sufficient, and His name the Powerful. God, His angels and His prophets bear witness that We have explained in these Tablets what was hidden from all eternity, and We have bestowed upon those endowed with insight the concealed and protected divine knowledge which was veiled in the clouds of glory. We counsel the servants of God to fear God, to follow His Cause, and to detach themselves from all else. Verily, He is the Protector of those who love Him, and verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>O questioner! Hearken unto the counsel of the Pen of Command! When thou dost purpose to pursue this hidden art, first ponder and reflect whether this supreme craft exists, or whether, like the Simurgh and Phoenix of old, it is but a name without reality. Consider whether these things must needs be similar and congruent, or different and contrary. When thou art apprised and hast attained certitude of its existence and source, there is no harm if thou shouldst strive to acquire it. Today the philosophers of the earth deny this divine secret and celestial wisdom, having proven to their own satisfaction that such a thing is impossible. Were their proofs to be mentioned, it would lead to prolixity. In brief, the cause of their denial is the preservation of the power of choice, for this treasure hath been guarded from the eyes of the treacherous and the hands of thieves. Ere long, however, some shall acknowledge and confess it. The manifestation of this hidden treasure among these people is a sign of the world’s maturity, after which shall follow grave peril and barren tribulation for the world and its people, unless all enter the divine paradise. O seeker! Hearken unto the counsel of this imprisoned servant. Act not before knowledge, and seek not from other than the source. For everything a cause hath been ordained, and for every matter an outlet. If thou desirest it, be not heedless thereof. Enter every house through its door. Thus was it revealed aforetime and now in this perspicuous Tablet. Reflect upon the source of this supreme craft until thou attainest certitude and knoweth. It hath been revealed before from the Most Exalted Pen that it existeth in the noblest of the three kingdoms. Ponder well: it is in the lesser world, and the lesser world reflects the greater world, nay rather encompasses it. They have considered the spheres as the greater world, and named the three kingdoms as animal, vegetable and mineral. Likewise it existeth in the noblest of all possible things, and they have said it is in the mountain–that is, the mountain that is related and connected to the lesser world. If any soul fail to comprehend these allusions, which are more eloquent than explicit declaration, and find not the truth, his pursuit of this knowledge would not be, nor ever shall be, advisable. O my Most Glorious Beloved! I have not fallen short, nor have I concealed aught, but God bestoweth His bounty upon whomsoever He willeth, and verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Know that there is much disagreement about the Philosopher’s Stone. Some have considered it to be gold, some the spirit, some vitriol, some mercury and sulfur, some have said it is hair, lead, copper and the like, and most have considered it to be the egg. Books are filled with these mentions. Reflect with intelligence and wisdom until you recognize with clear certainty the source of the Stone. Do not be satisfied with any book, for most seekers, having studied the books somewhat, have occupied themselves with composing and writing. “Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle; nay, they are even farther astray from the Path.” They have gone astray and led others astray. With Us is the knowledge of all things, and We have explained all things in detail.</p>
<p>Likewise, some philosophers have written of that which they have never understood. Indeed, in every age there have been the truthful and the false. Therefore, make reason, which is a divine trust, your lamp, and with this brilliant lamp enter into the darkness of words. Perhaps through the grace of the Lord of Names and Attributes you may reach the fountain of life. Never be satisfied with anyone’s traditions and allusions, for it has been observed that one who associated partners with God and shed the blood of His loved ones, during the few years he was present before the Face, heard something of every science and art, wrote it down, gave it to people, and thereby claimed superiority. Among these, someone mentioned that he had written papers specifically about this science for him, when, by God besides Whom there is no God, he knows not a letter of it. Among other things, he wrote about the work of division for someone as foolish as himself, not realizing that such works have always been rejected by the Truth, for division is fundamentally deceit and trickery, and working with it is forbidden. I seek God’s forgiveness from the works of this ignoble one. Would that a scholar in this art would test that obstinate atheist’s work, setting aside its practice. By God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, this servant, nay all that was and will be, are astonished by such souls. However, one possessed of hearing can distinguish the original voice from the borrowed voice, for that which appears from the Truth testifies by itself that it is from the Truth, and it has no equal or likeness in creation. But this is only when people of hearing and sight are present. In all conditions, God is indeed Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Ask God, exalted be His knowledge, for success, and then look into these Tablets and some Arabic and Persian Tablets which have been revealed from the Pen of the Self-Subsisting concerning this science, so that you may become aware of the foundation and substance of the matter. After becoming aware, begin to practice. Indeed, He guides whom He wishes to a straight path. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds. Through pure bounty, the drops of knowledge and meanings have trickled from the cloud of divine utterance, otherwise today is not the day for questions and answers. All souls must detach themselves from all things and occupy themselves with teaching God’s Cause and its triumph. Whoever has found the sweetness of this station will not turn to aught else.</p>
<p>Let him who finds the sweetness of this station turn to naught else and sacrifice his soul for love of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. We beseech God to let us hear [His call] - whoso heareth cannot rest, and he who resteth hath not heard - and to make us steadfast in His Cause, and this verily is a grace greater than all great things, and to aid us in that which He desireth, and to grant us the sweetness of His love and remembrance, for verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Glorious. We have adorned the heaven of utterance with the brilliant stars of four established words. The first: Know thou that We have traversed all the mines and found the mine of stone and intellect to be in a single plane. Glorified be He Who caused rivers to gush forth from rocks and placed within them the choicest essence which waters cannot drown, making it the greatest key to His treasuries which He hath concealed from eyes save whom He willeth and desireth. He is verily the Mighty, the Compelling. The second: At times We make mention of the stone and mean by it its bearer, and thus was it said and thus did We say in various Tablets that it exists in every place. Know thou, O man, the wisdom of the All-Merciful and give thanks to Him at all times. The third: We have explained the natural balance in the depths of Our words through symbols and allusions. Now We shall explain what the wise intended by balance in most operations, which pertaineth to quality not quantity, and that is similarity. Know thou the value of this bounty which hath descended from the heaven of all things and which We have detailed in detail as a mercy from Us to the people of Baha. The fourth: Know thou that what is meant by the child is that which is born of mercury and sulfur, and it is [the stone] that is sought, which ascendeth from the earth by the power of water. If thou sayest the newborn is earth, it is true as We have said before, for it is therein. Thus have We explained in clear Persian tongue. Verily it is the lord of all jewels and minerals, and it is the child that seeketh the virgin’s [milk] - nurse it that it may become a mature and perfect youth. Be not troubled by the varying statements of the Lord of all names and attributes - all return to a single point, just as sciences branch forth from the point, and crafts likewise branch forth from the generative point which is the stone. Glory be upon him who turneth to the Most Great Scene and becometh aware of the mysteries of destiny.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath come before Our presence and We found from it the fragrance of thy Lord’s love. We have answered what We wished concerning what thou asked, and thy Lord is possessed of great bounty. We have bestowed upon thee and upon the people of Baha that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning the hidden secret and the concealed symbol, and verily thy Lord is knowing of all things. By My life! Were anyone to understand what hath been revealed therein, he would testify that with Him is the knowledge of the first and the last. Would that We found servants to whom We might impart what lieth concealed within the pavilion of infallibility and what hath been inscribed by the Pen of Command upon a preserved and mighty tablet. Give thanks unto thy Lord for what We have sent thee, that thou mayest be steadfast in His love and that perchance the heedless servants who turned away from God after He came unto them with all signs and sent down the Bayan from the presence of the All-Merciful to prove His Manifestation might perceive the fragrances of knowledge and become of the assured ones. Give thanks unto thy Lord in all conditions and say:</p>
<p>O my Lord! Make Thy remembrance my companion, Thy countenance my goal, Thy good-pleasure my path, and Thy praise my work and hope among the worlds. And praise be to God, the Beloved of the mystics.</p>

<p>Honoured servant, his eminence Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Taqi - upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory - to peruse.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be worthy and befitting of our Beloved Who, at the time of His ascension to the throne in the garden named Ridvan, spoke three blessed verses. Through one verse He removed strife, contention, murder and pillage from the world, clearly and evidently declaring that the victory of the Cause had been ordained through wisdom and utterance. Blessed are they who, with supreme steadfastness, act in accordance with that which they have been commanded. The Lord of Destiny hath testified in another place: “I have come for fellowship and unity among the servants,” and similar words which have been revealed from the Supreme Pen in holy books and tablets. Nevertheless, it is observed that some are unaware of and uninformed about God’s firm and decisive Command. In truth, if anyone today intends to harm another soul, that harm befalls the Truth Himself. This is a statement which this evanescent servant has repeatedly heard from the Ancient Tongue. Today is the day of greatest joy, the day of speech and utterance, albeit with the wisdom which the All-Merciful hath revealed in His Mighty Book. The hearts of the people of Baha must be illumined and brightened by the lights of the Day-Star of Manifestation. They must conduct themselves with utmost love towards all the peoples of the world. Reflect upon this blessed word which is truly the unique pearl of the sea of inner meanings. His words, exalted be His glory: “Glory is not for him who loves his country, but for him who loves the world.” May a hundred thousand souls be sacrificed for this divine utterance, in every letter of which surges the ocean of bounty and flows the river of loving-kindness. Some time ago, a tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine will to His Holiness Ismullah Jamal - upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory - and this blessed passage in Persian flowed from the Supreme Pen. His words, exalted be His grandeur: “By the Truth Himself, if all manifest power - which in reality hath no station before God and never will - were to appear, and an executioner were to stand before Us with evil intent, We would certainly not oppose him and would leave him to himself.” It would be a pity if illumined hearts should be deprived and withheld from their delicacy by these dark clouds. If receptive soil is found, the seed of the All-Merciful’s wisdom should be deposited therein with the utmost joy and fragrance. Otherwise, verily He is independent of all worlds. This is the Day wherein the earth shineth with the light of its Lord, and wherein our Lord hath come and the angels rank upon rank. Man must act in these divine days as behooveth him. By the life of God, God hath created him for the edification of the world; he hath come for construction, not destruction. God doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. In the past, during the time of the Apostle of God - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - the ordinance of holy war was revealed, and in this Most Great, Most Mighty Manifestation that ordinance hath been lifted. He shall not be asked of His doings. Verily He is the Commander, the Questioner, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. May my soul be a sacrifice for His loving-kindness, and the spirit of the world be a sacrifice for His favors. Today all must look to that which God hath revealed in the Book, and arise to champion His Cause with truthful tongues, hallowed deeds and spiritual qualities, so that through the sweet-scented breezes of their pure and goodly deeds the people of the earth may attain the light of acceptance and turn unto the supreme horizon. Praise be to God Who hath appeared and made manifest His straight Path, and guided the people to His manifest horizon and His Most Great, Most Mighty Name. Today it is incumbent upon all to impart to the friends that which is beloved in the sight of God.</p>
<p>In this day, it is incumbent upon all to convey to the friends that which is well-pleasing and acceptable in the sight of God, lest through heedlessness any soul become the cause of harm to others. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the way. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beauteous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant was honored to receive your letter which testified to your devotion, humility, submissiveness, steadfastness and firmness in the Cause of our Lord and your Lord - the Cause through which the foundations of the learning of the learned and the principles of the knowledge of the mystics were shaken, save those whom God, your Lord and the Lord of all in the heavens and earth, willed. When I had read and reviewed it, I presented it, after obtaining permission, before His presence. His glory be magnified! He said: God willing, may they continually partake of the choice wine of the All-Merciful’s utterance and act in accordance with that which is befitting and worthy in this day. Specifically for some of the souls mentioned, wondrous and sublime verses were revealed and sent forth, that perchance they might truly attain unto their reading and be enabled to do that which He loveth and desireth. This is the day of the most great bounty. Should all the peoples of the world show forth love, even if they be devoid and deprived of its reality, the Sacred Court hath shown and will continue to show favor, that perchance the fragrances of the verses may guide them, lead them from the realm of fancy to the kingdom of certitude, and bring them from metaphor to reality. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.</p>
<p>And if, outwardly, the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was not revealed for some, this was due to wisdom known to none save God alone. From the heaven of the divine Will there descendeth upon steadfast and firm souls that which causeth their exaltation and elevation. And if, outwardly, wisdom requireth a delay in the sending of Tablets, the outpourings of the cloud of divine mercy will assuredly assist them inwardly and in their inmost hearts. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed are they whom the tales of old have not debarred from God, the Lord of all creation. Say: He is the Originator of the heavens and earth, and He is the One besides Whom no one can be known. To this did My Herald testify, yet most of the people are heedless. We have sent down these verses unto thee, and beyond them hath been revealed a glorious Tablet which, shouldst thou recite it with the tongue of reality, will attract thee to a station wherein no sorrows in all creation will grieve thee. To this doth the Lord of Religions testify from this luminous horizon.</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! We make mention of him whom thou didst mention in thy letter, and We conceal his name through a wisdom from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen him to that whereby his remembrance shall endure through the eternity of His most beautiful names. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. He may make mention of God in accordance with that which the Supreme Pen hath uttered.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the God of names, my Creator and the Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by the Name through which Thou didst cause the ship of Thy Cause to sail upon land and sea by Thy will, whereby every world was shaken, every heedless one trembled, and every mighty foundation was made to quiver, to aid me in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned, the mystics and the literary men have slipped, save those whom Thou didst deliver through Thy bounty and favors. O Lord, I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from what lies with Thee, nor to deprive me from the ocean of Thy knowledge and the sun of Thy grace. Grant me then, O my God, the Kawthar of steadfastness by the hands of Thy bounty. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest. Neither ranks nor swords can prevent Thee, nor can circumstances and multitudes frustrate Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He is the All-Wise Teacher!</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Taqi that he may rejoice in this remembrance whereby all things have proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.” The Wronged One maketh mention of the servants of God on earth and summoneth them unto God, the Lord of existence. Blessed is the seeing one who hath recognized his Lord, and the hearing one who, when he heard the Call from beyond the Sea of Grandeur, cried: “Here am I, here am I, O God of the seen and the unseen!” Say: The Wronged One speaketh not from mere desire - to this beareth witness the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below - yet most of the people understand not. This is the Day which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “The Kingdom on that Day shall be God’s,” yet most of the people perceive not. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed every rejected learned one. Say: This is the Day of Manifestation, did ye but know it, and this is the Day of Utterance, yet ye remain silent. Arise from the slumber of passion, then turn toward the Supreme Horizon which hath been illumined by this Name through which the gate of heaven was opened and the hosts of the Spirit descended with glory upon the people of Baha who heard and responded when the Truth came, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>In His Name, the One Who ruleth over all names!</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin, that the remembrance of the Wronged One may attract him to a station wherein he will testify to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth. We give glad tidings to those who have cast away vain imaginings, turning unto God, the One, the Single, the All-Informed. O people! Rejoice in this Manifestation which was promised in the Books of God and through which was revealed what was hidden behind the veils of the unseen. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, speaketh the truth. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Great. Thus hath the Tongue spoken and the proof appeared. Blessed is the soul that hath heard and responded, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!</p>
<p>O Ahmad! We impart unto thee that which shall profit thee in every world of the worlds of thy Lord. Be thou grateful and among the thankful ones. Beware lest the ornaments of the world withhold thee from the Lord of Names. The earthly kingdom shall perish, but that which hath been ordained by the Omnipotent, the Ancient of Days, shall endure. Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and cling to the hem of His mercy, and say: O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations! I beseech Thee by Thy Name which Thou hast made the King of Names in the kingdom of creation, to strengthen me in turning toward Thee and in directing myself to the horizon of Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou art the Generous and I am the suppliant at Thy gate; Thou art the Forgiving and I am the sinner hoping for the outpourings of the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Send down upon me from the clouds of Thy bounty that which will purify me from all except Thee, sanctify me from all save Thee, and enable me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Exalted, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>These blessed Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will and inscribed in this writing. Subsequently, it was commanded that copies thereof be recorded in other Tablets and dispatched so that each of those souls might be honored with a separate Tablet. The name of one of those souls was, as a matter of wisdom, not mentioned at the beginning of the Tablet. Your honor should consider whether it would be wise to distribute the Tablets, as some are investigators who would enter to gain information. Therefore, the utmost wisdom must be observed.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about unity and arising to serve the Cause, may you ever be confirmed in these matters. These points were also presented before His presence. Thus did speak the Tongue of God in the Kingdom of Utterance. You must arise to serve the Cause in such wise that no trace of discord remain in that land. This word is the unique pearl of the ocean of divine commandments. Blessed is he who ariseth unto this mighty Cause. Whosoever today becometh the cause of unity and reconciliation is regarded by God as among His chosen ones and servants.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about certain followers of Christ - may the spirit of the worlds be sacrificed for Him - after it was presented before the Most Holy Court, He said: “Today Christ is hastening and speaking in the desert of longing, yet His followers are seen to be deprived, save whom God willeth. It is very difficult for those souls to turn to the Most Exalted Horizon and to be detached from what they possess in favor of what God possesseth. Most of those souls are observed to be like the people of the Qur’an, manifesting vain imaginings, speaking of vain imaginings, and returning to vain imaginings. It is strange that certain souls have turned and continue to turn to the unseemly words of those deluded ones. By God’s life! They possess nothing worthy of attention or hearing. They have not had nor do they have any word worthy of being heard.”</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Rustam-’Ali and his request for an exalted Tablet, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Sublime Station. A wondrous and exalted Tablet was revealed for him from the heaven of God’s Will, and for your two sisters also a mighty, most exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace. The mention of the honored leaf, the mother - upon her be the Glory of God - has been before the Most Holy Court. The utmost favor hath been shown to her. Whatever befell her in God’s path is evident before the Beloved of the worlds. Their mention hath been repeatedly revealed from the heaven of God’s Will. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Generous, the Speaker, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Specifically for all the names that were in your letter, and likewise for those souls who have submitted petitions, wondrous and exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of favor. God willing, may all attain unto them and engage in teaching the Cause with pure wisdom. The favors of God, glorified and exalted be He, have reached such a degree that for all souls who have been mentioned or will be mentioned, whether living or dead, exalted Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of divine Will. Beseech ye God that souls may be set ablaze by the heat of the Fire burning in the Divine Tree, and be seen manifesting the love of God and acting in service to His Cause.</p>
<p>O friends of God! This is the Day that hath been mentioned and recorded in all the Books, Scriptures, Psalms and Tablets. By the life of God! It is more glorious than all else in the sight of God, the Lord of the worlds. How blessed is the state of those souls who have recognized Him and acted as befitteth Him. God willing, may all attain unto this most exalted and sublime station and receive their portion from the breezes of these days. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. And verily He is the Helper, the Ordainer, the Counsellor, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>A Tablet hath also been revealed specifically for A. and H. the photographer. If possible, deliver it to them, otherwise leave it in trust with their mother. On this occasion, this servant, the attendant, hath copied and sent some of these exalted Tablets from the original revelation, as the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of His most pure footsteps - was not present.</p>
<p>A petition from H., upon him be the Glory of God, reached the Most Holy Court, and many have requested his stay in that land. Their request hath been accepted before God. He said that if it be accomplished with joy and fragrance, it would be good. Should God will it, He will unite what is scattered. This evanescent one’s request is that you convey my greetings to H. J., upon him be the Most Glorious Glory, and to him who was named Ali-i-Akbar in the presence of the Greatest Scene, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power.</p>
<p>This evanescent one expresseth his sincerity and nothingness to all the friends. Dh., upon him be the Glory of God, and Aqa Mirza Abu-?alib, upon him be the Glory of God, and H. A., upon him be the Glory of God, and H., upon him be the Glory of God - praise be to God, they have all attained unto divine favors, and for each one a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed and sent. Convey this servant’s utter effacement and nothingness to them and to other friends who have attained unto the divine Tablet, and likewise to those souls who have been or are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. God willing, may they drink from the cup of unity and act as befitteth this Day.</p>
<p>This is the Day of mention and utterance, this is the Day of service. God willing, may all attain unto it. Today we must all fix our gaze upon that which causeth the exaltation of the Cause, turn away from what is with the people and turn towards what is with God. O friends! The gate of heaven hath ever been open and the cloud of mercy hath ever been lifted up. God willing, we must strive and arise to make up for what we have lost during the days of this Most Great Manifestation, which hath been mentioned and recorded in all the divine Books. We must all cling with the hands of hope to the hem of His grace. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Verily He is the Giver, the Bestower, the Kind, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Another request is that you should convey expressions of evanescence and nothingness to His Holiness Ismu’llah Javad, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and likewise to his honor Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God. From the people of the mainland in these days a petition has reached the Most Holy Court. It is hoped that a response will be revealed and sent from the heaven of favor. God willing, all affairs have appeared and will appear according to desire. If until now all had acted according to what has flowed from the Supreme Pen, all would have observed themselves in the cradle of peace, security and supreme tranquility. The Glory be upon you and upon them from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Servant. 19 Jamadi’l-Avval 1298. It is submitted that not all the revealed Tablets were sent in this instance, as wisdom did not require it, therefore nineteen mighty and impregnable Tablets were sent in these two posts, and the remainder, should God will it, will be sent in the next instance.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be unto Him Who hath illumined the world with the lights of His Most Great Name, that He might make known unto the peoples that which draweth them nigh unto Him through His grace. Blessed is the eye that hath beheld the lights, the ear that hath heard the mysteries, the face that hath turned towards Him, the heart that hath accepted Him, the tongue that hath spoken, the hand that hath grasped, and the foot that hath arisen to serve the Cause on this Day wherein every hidden thing hath been revealed, every treasured thing brought forth, every realm thrown into commotion, and every mighty foundation made to tremble. Glory and praise be upon those who have not broken the Covenant and who have traversed the horizons out of love for God, the Lord of the worlds. These are servants who have aided the Cause of God, who have spoken His praise and who have spread His firm and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>Thereafter, it is submitted that thy letters dated the first of Dhi’l-Qa’dah, the fifth of Muharram, and the eighth of Muharram all arrived in one envelope. As they all testified to thy humility, submissiveness, steadfastness and service in the path of God, they brought the utmost joy and gladness. God willing, mayest thou ever remain occupied with the mention and praise of the Truth and steadfast in service. After being apprised of their contents, they were presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and after permission was granted, the details were submitted. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of utterance!</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! Thy petitions have attained the honor of being heard. God willing, mayest thou ever remain steadfast, firm and upright. The Supreme Pen beareth witness to thy acceptance, recognition, obedience and service, and this testimony sufficeth. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord, the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. O Abu’l-Hasan! The face of the world is changing. For the sake of the religion of God, hardly anything remaineth among the people. They worship the idols of vain imaginings and are heedless of the Truth, exalted be His glory. Whosoever in this day hath attained unto recognition and steadfastness is reckoned among the people of truth and is mentioned by the Concourse on High; all others are as non-existent and as naught. Each day strange and wondrous tribulations appear, yet none taketh notice. In truth, divine wrath hath encompassed all. We beseech the True One to assist all and make them aware.</p>
<p>We make mention of My loved ones in that place who have clung to the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Bountiful. Say: O people of Baha! Strive ye and hold fast unto that which is befitting this Day. Guide the people through deeds and conduct, and give them to drink of the water of true knowledge. In the watches of the night and throughout the day, the Supreme Pen is occupied with the mention of souls who have accepted the Faith. The comprehension of this station is hidden, for were the loved ones of God to catch its fragrance and become aware of its loftiness and sublimity, they would all assuredly arise to do that which God loveth. From this station We send Our glorification upon their faces and We bid them to that which will exalt the Cause of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention of My handmaidens who have attained unto My sealed wine. Upon them, both men and women, be the glory of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Convey My glorification to the handmaidens of God who are related to thee, give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory, and make them joyous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Through the grace of the True One, Who hath no peer or equal, thou art blessed. Thou didst mention those friends of God who, praise be to God, are illumined by the rays of the Sun of Truth and are steadfast and firm in the Divine Cause. This brought boundless joy, and when it was presented before the Ancient Beauty, He was seen to smile. In truth, if at all times they hold fast to unity and harmony, assuredly the light of concord will illumine the horizons and the flame of unity will ignite the hearts. Praise be to God, the river of mercy flows from the right hand of the Throne. God willing, the trees of existence have attained and will attain their portion. This is that water of which He saith, “And from water We made all things living.” A hundred thousand thanks that thy letter brought that which caused joy, gladness and delight. Some time ago, a detailed letter was written and sent to thee and also to Aqa Muhammad-Hasan, upon him be 96[Baha’u’llah], who was bearing the blessed Tablets. God willing, it hath arrived and its lights have encompassed all hearts.</p>
<p>As to thy mention that Ibn-i-Ismu’llah-i-Asdaq, Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, and Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon them be the Glory of God, are engaged in serving the Cause and specifically intend to travel to various regions for teaching - when this was presented, He said: “Excellent is what they have done.” May God, exalted be His glory, through His wondrous grace and bounty, make people ready to hearken unto the blessed Word, that they may hear from them and turn to the highest horizon. The Command is in His hands; He guideth whom He willeth through His grace, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding thy mention of Aqa Mirza Husayn from the people of Ta and Fa, upon him be the Glory of God, God willing, may he be assisted and enkindled. The servant beseecheth his Lord to strengthen him to remain steadfast in what he was, and to grant him in every moment the Kawthar of His bounty that he may drink thereof and be in such wise that neither the ranks of words nor their ornamentations prevent him from God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Concerning Haji Mirza Zaynu’l-’Abidin B. R., upon him be the Glory of God, thou didst write that he watcheth over the affairs of the friends. Excellent is what he hath done in the path of God. God willing, may he be assisted and confirmed. If thou shouldst meet him later, convey greetings to him on behalf of this evanescent one.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the Huququ’llah, the firm divine ordinance hath been revealed in the Book, and this matter dependeth upon the acceptance of the souls themselves, for God, exalted be His glory, looking to His previous mercy, hath informed all of what hath been prescribed in the Book. Blessed are they that act! Demanding it is not and hath never been beloved. Every matter should be accomplished with the utmost spirit and fragrance. From whomsoever accepteth with complete contentment and payeth it, accept it; otherwise, verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is independent of all worlds. Today one must hold fast to that which causeth the exaltation, elevation and glory of the Cause. Thus hath spoken the True One, the Knower of things unseen, aforetime, and the servant heard it with his own ear. O my beloved! If people were to perceive the sweetness of the divine commandments and their fruits, surely all would act upon them with the utmost eagerness and yearning. We beseech God to assist all to do what He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Helper, the Confirmer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you mentioned about Aqa ’Abdu’l-Karim, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, his sincerity and devotion were presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. These decisive verses were revealed from the heaven of will - His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath appeared and hath manifested that which was recorded in the books of old by the Most Exalted Pen. He, verily, is the Powerful, the Mighty. We have mentioned those who have sought the ultimate goal and the highest summit, and We mention them as a token of Our grace. To this testifieth every fair-minded and perceiving one. O ’Abdu’l-Karim! Abu’l-Hasan hath mentioned thee in his letter. We have revealed for thee this wondrous Tablet. Blessed is the face that hath turned and the heart that hath advanced toward God, the Lord of the worlds. Be steadfast in the Path, firm in the Cause, and speak in praise of thy gracious Lord. Verily, He heareth the call and answereth, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. Ask thou God to assist thee to remain steadfast in this mighty Cause and to aid thee to act in accordance with what He hath revealed in His wise Book - the Book at whose revelation the clouds have passed away, the breezes of revelation have wafted, the Bridge hath been set up, the Balance hath been established, and the nightingale hath warbled upon the branches. Dominion belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Praised One.</p>
<p>God willing, may they attain unto this Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet and become fragrant with the sweet savors of its verses. Blessed is he who perceiveth the fragrance of his Lord’s verses and is among the steadfast ones.</p>
<p>And concerning what you mentioned about Aqa ’Ali-Akbar Bey, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Glorious, and Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of Unity hath spoken - His word, exalted be His grandeur: God willing, may they be blessed with divine favors. They have been mentioned before and after. Praise be to God, they have attained unto the mention of the Beloved of the worlds, and this is among God’s greatest bounties. We, from this station, glorify him and give him glad tidings of mercy from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The honored Haji Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God and His favor, was mentioned in the Most Holy Presence, and what was given to them was mentioned, and praise be to God, it was accepted. Likewise regarding the mount that you have repeatedly written about, and that Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory, has also mentioned - it was written to them that you have explained the details. According to the command, whatever the friends of God give as a gift to be presented to the Presence, their wishes must be carried out so that the hearts of those who have turned to God and the minds of the sincere ones may not be clouded with grief. And whatever is given as Huquq, permission is granted for it to be sold. They commanded: Write to Abu’l-Hasan - in all matters, keep your gaze fixed on that which will exalt the Cause of God. This is the counsel of the Wronged One.</p>
<p>Therefore the aforementioned mount should reach the Most Holy Presence, and care should be taken that it not become impaired on the journey, as has happened before. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey greetings to the honorable Bey and other friends of God. God willing, may all remain firm as mountains, ablaze like fire, and luminous like light. Verily, bounty is in His hand - He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote in your second letter, numbered 4 and dated the fifth of Muharram, concerning the details of the properties in the land of Kha, the decree regarding this had already been issued through divine grace, stating that gifts should be presented to the Most Holy Court, and whatever is in the name of Huquq, the honored Afnan–upon him be all the most glorious Baha–and your honor may arrange as deemed appropriate. Praise be to God, your gaze has been and continues to be fixed upon the Supreme Horizon, and you have attained unto the word of contentment, which is the greatest of all great matters. Under all conditions, God willing, you have been and are seeking the exaltation of the Cause. Thus has spoken the Desired One, before and after. Verily, He is the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the friends of God, that in every place and dwelling they have shown and continue to show you the utmost consideration–this detail was presented at the Most Holy Court, and each of these mentioned souls has been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Truth, and mention of them all has flowed from the tongue of Truth, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they, and theirs is a goodly return, and theirs is a goodly station, and theirs is the best in the Hereafter and in this world.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Muhammad-Qabli-Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God that he has been successful in serving the Cause. Previously, wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed and sent specifically for him and his namesake, Ibn-i-Lat, whom you had mentioned. Likewise, this servant, according to his capacity and lowliness, sent him a letter. Additionally, divine, impregnable, and holy Tablets were sent specifically for some of the friends of Truth in their land. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be His glory, that He will assist them to preserve what has been bestowed upon them, that the conditions of creation will not render them idle, and that the coldness of the heedless souls will not cause them to become dispirited. That they appointed him as representative was acceptable, but in all cases they must observe the exaltation of the Cause. Demanding is not and has never been permissible. If any soul turns with the utmost spirit, fragrance and contentment to pay the Huquq, it should be accepted; otherwise, verily God is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Consider what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur’an. His exalted Word states: “And among them he who wrongs his own soul, and among them he who follows a middle course, and among them he who outstrips others through good deeds.” Whatever good becomes manifest, its benefit returns to the souls of those who act. Had they known, they would have hastened to good deeds. They have said: “Forsake the entire world, but forsake not even an atom of the exaltation of God’s Cause.” This is the divine counsel that has been inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the crimson scroll. Blessed are they who act accordingly.</p>
<p>Ask God to assist souls to do what befits the Day of God, that they may act with perfect contentment in accordance with what they have been commanded in God’s Book. And regarding your mention of those souls who have been successful in paying the Huquq, this is from God’s bounty to them and His favor upon them. Mention of each of them was presented at the Most Holy Court, and bounty was manifested and evident in relation to each one.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of the honored Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of destiny; the honored Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God; the honored Mahbubi, son of Ismu’llah-i-Asdaq, upon them both be all His most glorious glory; and the honored Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the glory and favor of God - that they are all engaged in serving the Cause - this was presented. The sun of loving-kindness has ever been and continues to be shining upon them from the heaven of grace. Their letters have also been received. God willing, this servant shall succeed in responding to them, for now occupations have increased to such a degree that free time has become like the legendary phoenix - spoken of but non-existent. May God, exalted be His glory, assist them and protect them from the burning fire of the heedless polytheists. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the honored Aqa Shaykh Sadiq, upon him be the glory of God, God willing may he be assisted in serving the Cause. Convey greetings from this servant to him and say: God willing, may you be successful in serving the Cause. Let not time slip away - this is the time for service, that is, teaching God’s Cause with the wisdom which the All-Bestowing One hath revealed in the Book. God willing, may they succeed in that which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Some time ago, a most mighty and holy Tablet was revealed specifically for him, and this servant, as commanded, made a copy from the original. Now it is being sent - deliver it to him. God willing, may they be gladdened by the fragrances of the verses and adorn the people with the ornament of life through the living waters. Convey greetings from this servant to the honored Mulla Husayn and say: Today is the day of steadfastness and the day of teaching. God willing, may they be assisted in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of the Land of Alif, those related to the honored Fath-i-A’zam, upon him be all the most glorious glory, have been and continue to be remembered before the Throne, and God’s favor has been and continues to be directed towards them. This servant beseeches and hopes that God will assist them in preserving their stations. And regarding your mention of the honored Aqa Mirza Faraju’llah, this was presented before the Most Holy Court. This most mighty and exalted Tablet was revealed for him:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Forgiving, the Merciful</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One while imprisoned in the hands of the heedless. Verily He came for the reformation of the world, yet the people opposed and objected until there befell Him that which caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament. Thus did the Pen speak by the command of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in the world. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. We counsel thee and those who have believed to that whereby the Cause of God shall be uplifted amongst His creation. He is verily the Counselor, the Trustworthy. And We remember My loved ones there who were not held back by the intimations of the divines from this Great Announcement. When a crier crieth from among the criers, leave him behind you, turning unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto the heedless. O people of Baha! Upon you be the glory of God and upon those who have drunk the choice sealed wine from the cups of the words of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for the honored Mulla Rida ’Ababaf in Zavarih:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious […]</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful in Z? and WAW! Hearken to the call of the Wronged One. He summons you to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and gives you glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for you from the Supreme Pen, and reminds you of that which will assist you in this Cause from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is the ear that hath attained unto the call of God, and the heart that hath turned to the praiseworthy station. Grieve not over the world and its hardships. By the life of God! The greatest joy hath been ordained for you, did ye but know it. The Day of Resurrection hath come, yet the people remain seated. The Day of Glory hath appeared, yet the people turn away from it.</p>
<p>O people of Baha! Ye were all created for goodly deeds, spiritual qualities, and the betterment of the world. God willing, through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, ye shall act in accordance with that which is befitting and meet in this day. Know ye your worth and preserve your stations through the name of the peerless Beloved. This blessed day hath no likeness or equal. God willing, may ye be assisted to perform such deeds as shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Behold ye and remember when the Sacrifice proceeded to the place of offering and gave up his spirit by his own hand in the path of God, the Lord of Names. By the life of God! The Concourse on High welcomed him, and the tribes of the near ones descend upon his resting place at eventide and dawn. The glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon him and upon those whom the affairs of names prevented not from the Creator of heaven, who cast away the world and held fast to the Most Great Name, which proclaimeth that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Rida! We have heard thy call and answered thee, and have witnessed thy turning and have turned unto thee from this noble station. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to turn unto Thee. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause in all conditions. O Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones, and decree for me that which shall profit me in the world to come and in this world. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Praised be God that the souls mentioned in your letter have attained to matchless grace. God willing, may they drink from the hidden seas within the words of the Revealer of verses - such a draught that the affairs of the world shall not prevent them from the Lord of Eternity. May they ever be enkindled with the fire of love and illumined by the light of knowledge. The Command is in the hands of God, the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Haji ’Ali-Akbar, there hath been revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance, specially for him and the other friends, that which cannot be equaled by heaven and earth. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Thou hast mentioned My loved ones in Za and Vav, and now mention them once again. Verily, Thy grace encompasseth all created things, and Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful. Beware lest the affairs of the world stay thee. Move like lightning, nay with greater speed, by the leave of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou, O Pen! I testify that thou hast not fallen short in any matter, having been remembering in the nights and days. Thou hast been in constant motion, commemorating God and His loved ones at all times. The river of wisdom and utterance hath flowed from thee, and thy fragrance hath wafted between the heavens and the earth. Thou hast been with Me at all times and hast attained the presence in all conditions, and thou art the one who hath won My beautiful praise. Say: O My loved ones! Rejoice in My remembrance, then remember the Wronged One Who hath been imprisoned in the land of exile through what the hands of the heedless have wrought. O ’Ali-Akbar! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee inasmuch as thou hast turned to God and held fast to His firm cord. Be steadfast in the Cause. Beware lest the clamor of the doubtful ones deter thee. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken as a token of His grace, and He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Aqa Siyyid Yusuf from the land of Husayn-Abad, upon him be the Glory of God, and his son Aqa Siyyid Husayn, it was presented before the Most Holy Court, and this blessed Tablet was revealed from the heaven of favor especially for them. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Yusuf! The whole world hath awaited this Day, occupied with its remembrance throughout the nights and days. This is the Day that hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen as the Day of God in all divine Books, Tablets and Scriptures. Yet when the splendors of the dawn of God’s Day appeared, all became heedless and arose in opposition and objection. The party that considered itself the best of all parties and would speak of hastening the advent of the Qa’im, ultimately pronounced the verdict for His death. O Yusuf! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and wholly purify and sanctify thine ears from former vain imaginings, that thou mayest attain to hearing the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and comprehend the cooing of the Dove of Eternity. Great is the Day and great is the Cause. Strive, while time remaineth, to attain unto that which is everlasting and eternal. Blessed art thou and thy son who is named Husayn. We, from this station, send Our glorification upon thee and him, and We give you both glad tidings of My wondrous Tablet. The Glory be upon you both and upon those who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Munificent, the Generous. We beseech for you both supreme steadfastness in this Cause, which when it appeared, every mighty pillar was shaken.</p>
<p>O My loved one! The verses, proofs, manifestations and signs have, by God besides Whom there is none other God, appeared in such wise that all tongues and pens are powerless to describe and express them. Now must ye supplicate with utmost humility and devotion to the Self-Sufficing Lord that He may not deprive the people, and that the crowing of the crows and the clamor of the deniers may not become a barrier. And as for the mention made of Aqa Siyyid Ra?i from Fat?-Abad, it was presented before the most mighty and exalted Court, and this blessed Tablet was revealed especially for him. God willing, may he attain his goal and not remain deprived of the Kawthar of utterance.</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Today every soul must ponder what hath been revealed and search with their own intellect and understanding, lest they be deprived of the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth. The Truth hath ever been and shall forever remain distinct from aught else. The opposition of the opposers and denial of the deniers hath never mattered and never shall, for in every age and cycle when the Luminary of Truth appeared, the divines, mystics and princes rose up in opposition and exerted their utmost to extinguish the divine light. Consider the advent of Christ - what the Jewish divines inflicted upon Him was greater than what any had suffered before. Likewise observe what the idolatrous priests and those learned in the Gospel wreaked upon the Seal of the Prophets. I swear by the Sun of Truth that what was visited upon Him caused the Concourse on High to raise their lamentations. In light of this, the discerning soul should not cling to people’s opposition and objections, thereby depriving themselves of the Truth. O Rady, God willing thou shalt observe with thine own eyes and ponder with utmost fairness upon what hath been manifested, that perchance the hand of bounty may take hold of thee, deliver thee from the depths of doubt and fancy, and guide thee to the dawn of certitude. Verily He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path. All praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>And likewise thy other letter dated the eighth of Muharram arrived like a rose. In truth, as it was adorned with the mention of God and His praise, the musk-like fragrance of inner meanings wafted from it. It was a flower that reminded the lovers of the springtime days of divine knowledge. God willing, may thou ever be occupied with the mention of Truth and attain His bounty.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of Aqa Muhammad Ibrahim in the land of Qaf and Mim, the beloved Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], had mentioned him. A Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to him. God willing, may he drink cup after cup of recognition from the divine Tablet and strive to adorn the dead world with the ornament of life through the outpourings of the ocean of inner meanings. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>The mention of the honored cotton-carders, upon them be the Glory of God, has been made repeatedly. Praise be to God, they are recipients of the bounties of the All-Bountiful Lord. Their mention hath been and is before the Most Holy Court. And regarding what thou wrote about the funds that the aforementioned ones gave to the honored mother of the sanctuary, upon her be the Glory of God and His bounty, before and after - well done to them, then again well done to them. They themselves wrote the details from the land of K. If thou meetest the brothers, namely the honored cotton-carders, upon them be the Glory of God, convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent one.</p>
<p>And regarding what thou mentioned about Jasb and the loved ones of God in that land, it was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. These sublime utterances were revealed from the Dayspring of the bounty of the Lord of Names and Attributes. God willing, may they drink from the Kawthar of utterance and attain new life. He saith, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the Expositor in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>O loved ones of God in Jasb! Hearken unto what the Wronged One remindeth you from the direction of the Prison, and calleth you unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Beware lest the conditions of creation hold you back from the Truth. Leave what the people possess and take what ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds. Say […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Names, Creator of the heavens, Who art manifest in the kingdom of creation and Who gazest from the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech Thee by the fire of the Sacred Tree, and the light of Oneness, and by the murmur of the water of life in the Most Exalted Paradise, and the rustling of the breezes of reunion in the Supreme Paradise, that Thou write down for us that which will draw us nigh unto Thee in all conditions. O Lord! Thou seest the dead hastening toward the ocean of life and the sinners turning unto Thee, O Forgiver of sins. We beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by Thy Name, the Manifest, the Witnessed, and by the cry of the lovers in their separation from Thee, and the lamentation of the yearning ones in their remoteness from Thee, and by the breasts that have welcomed arrows in Thy love, that Thou assist us in serving Thee and in promoting Thy Cause, and enable us to achieve this matter whereby the feet of the learned and the mystics have slipped in Thy kingdom. O Lord! We are servants who have turned toward the horizon of Thy grace. We beseech Thee not to deprive us of what lieth with Thee, then clothe us in the garments of bounty by the hands of Thy mercy. O Lord! Thou art the Generous, possessed of great bounty. Write down for us from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>The names of the loved ones of that land which that honored one had written were individually presented before the Most Holy Court, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet, together with special prayers for all, hath been revealed. God willing, they will attain unto the reading thereof. The honored Beloved, Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God, hath also mentioned them. Perhaps separate tablets will also be sent for each one. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bestower, the Munificent, the Giver, the Generous. On behalf of this ephemeral one, convey greetings to each one and say that, God willing, ye should be so steadfast in the Cause that when any barker entereth that land, he shall return therefrom disappointed and in loss, like frightened asses fleeing from a lion. Today is the day when the gems of human existence should appear in the realm through the polish of divine favor. Effort is needed. Blessed is the one who hath arisen with power to assist the Cause of his Lord with wisdom and utterance. He is indeed of the people of this noble station.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention that was made of Badiqan and the loved ones of the All-Merciful in that land, it was presented before the Throne, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed specifically for the honored Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the Glory of God, and the friends of that land. God willing, may they attain unto and drink from the Kawthar of divine utterance. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>A Book sent down by the Wronged One from this praiseworthy station to him who was named Mahmud, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O Mahmud! We heard thy call before and answered thee out of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Most Sublime Horizon when all people turned away from it save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, did please. How many a servant awaited My days, how many a learned one searched for My station, and how many a mystic lamented My separation. Yet when I manifested Myself, they turned away from Me and denied My signs, until they pronounced judgment against Me with manifest injustice. O Mahmud! Take the Book with the strength granted by Us and grieve not because of those who cast the verses of God behind their backs, following vain imaginings and idle fancies. Arise to serve the Cause, then make mention of the Wronged One amidst myriads of those near unto God. From this glorious station, We send Our greetings upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this mighty Cause. Give them the glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness and His mercy, and remind them of this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped. The glory shining forth from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon them from God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Hearken in the Persian tongue. Strive that perchance thou mayest revive the dispirited and withered ones, and lead those who thirst in the wilderness of error to the Salsabil of guidance. Today the sun of bounty is shining and the heaven of generosity is upraised. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized and attained. Woe unto the heedless ones! Under all conditions, occupy thyself with teaching the Cause in wisdom and utterance, in the name of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Verily, He is with His servants who teach. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O My loved one! The words of God, exalted be His glory, are bestowed and granted as a cup-bearer of the Kawthar of life. Blessed are they who drink! The person of insight beholdeth in the hand of each one a cup of living water. He taketh it and drinketh in the name of the Friend, despite every deceitful opponent.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the land of K and likewise the meeting with the honored and beloved Haji Mirza Juni, upon him be the glory of God. Mention of him hath been and will continue to be made in the Most Holy Court. He is among the early souls. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to ever assist him in that which is befitting. After the arrival of thy letter, a detailed account was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for him from the Kingdom of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O Letter Jim! Hearken unto what the Word of God uttereth from the Prison. He hath remembered thee before, through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful was wafted throughout all possibility, and remembereth thee at this hour, and giveth thee glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for thee by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book. Preserve this station through the name of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty. Behold the world and its conditions, its changes, its passing, and its extinction, and cleave unto that whereby thy remembrance shall be exalted throughout the endurance of names and thy deeds shall remain throughout ages which none save God, the Lord of all worlds, hath knowledge of. Rejoice thou in this Most Great Remembrance, then recite it. Verily it shall draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt hear naught save the rushing of the winds of My loving-kindness, and the flowing of the Kawthar of Mine utterance, and the cooing of the Dove of My grace, the All-Encompassing over all who are in the heavens and the earth. Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the Kingdom of utterance that thou mayest hear and be of the thankful ones. Remember My loved ones in whom thou findest the radiance of Baha, and give them glad tidings of the favors of their Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. Say: By God! This is the Day of remembrance and utterance. Arise with spirit and joy to proclaim this momentous News. Say: Beware lest earthly affairs prevent you from the Lord of Heaven. Leave the people of idle fancies to their vain imaginings and take the Choice Wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name. This is what ye have been commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. That which ye behold today shall perish, but there shall remain for you what hath been sent down from the Pen of your Lord, the All-Informed. Thus have We adorned the heaven of the Tablet with the sun of the remembrance of My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those women who have believed in God, the Single, the One, the Wise.</p>
<p>From the fragrances of the verses of the Desired One of the world, the station of grace and favor regarding them is evident and known. It hath not needed and doth not need mention by this evanescent one. If thou shouldst meet with them again, convey greetings from this servant. God, exalted be His glory, is witness and knoweth that they have not departed and will not depart from the sight of this evanescent one, and God sufficeth as a witness. God willing, they shall, through wisdom and utterance, quicken dead hearts, that the effect of their service may endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. All that is visible shall, in the passing of today or tomorrow, perish and pass away. May God, exalted be His glory, assist steadfast souls and immortalize them through the mention of the Supreme Pen in the Paradise of Books. In the days when I was in their service, one day in the prayer hall of the mosque they said to this evanescent one: “Today is not the day for flight, for the Pole of the world is still.” And in truth it was a perfect word that appeared from the horizon of their utterance, for the Truth was concealed and none was aware of Him until this servant arrived in the Abode of Peace. After some time engaged in service, the veil was lifted and the reality of the Cause became clear. And for a time, though I was in His presence, I was utterly bewildered and amazed, for I observed that all were heedless. And after passing from extinction to consciousness, I remained silent and expectant until He appeared and manifested what He willed through His power, His might, and His sovereignty. But now I say to their presence: The Day hath come and the people perceive it not. Today is the day of flight, and today is the day of remembrance and utterance. One must soar with a hundred thousand wings and speak with a hundred thousand tongues in remembrance, praise, and teaching of the Cause. Yet wisdom is necessary in all stations, lest there arise that which would disturb minds and souls.</p>
<p>And regarding your mention once again of Jenab-i-Nabil-i-Qabla Ha and Sin Nun and his namesake LT, upon them be 669 [Baha’u’llah], and likewise their degrees of yearning and eagerness and their arising to serve the Cause - this was presented. He said: “May they attain, God willing, to a station worthy of this Most Holy and Most Exalted Day. The outward conditions of the world shall return to nothingness in less than a moment. The person of insight has been and shall be focused on that which endures. Blessed are they both and blessed is he who has turned to the horizon of God, the Lord of the worlds.” This evanescent servant beseeches God to cause them to attain to that which leads to the exaltation and elevation of their station.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about the family of the departed and ascended Aqa Muhammad Ja’far, upon them be 669 [Baha’u’llah] - severance of relations is not permitted, but if they proceed with the knowledge of Jenab-i-Haji Mirza Juni, upon him be 669 [Baha’u’llah], there is no harm. This much I submit: mention of them has been and continues to be made at the Divine Threshold, and they are recipients of divine favors. What station is greater than this? By the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings, whosoever today attains to but one word from God, it suffices him, and that word shall be with him in all the worlds. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. Every heart that has turned to Him is mentioned before God, and every tongue that has voiced His praise has had its reward recorded by the Supreme Pen. Not an atom’s weight of the deeds of those who act shall be lost. Verily, He does not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish. Give those honored ladies the glad tidings of divine favors, that they may occupy themselves with the praise of the Beloved of the worlds with their whole heart and tongue. How many souls who outwardly seem distant have had stations of nearness recorded for them by the Supreme Pen, and how many who are near are not mentioned among those who are nigh. This evanescent servant asks and hopes that God, exalted be His glory, will assist all to do what is beneficial and enable them to achieve that which leads to eternal life. Verily, He is the Protector of whoever loves Him, the Helper of whoever aids Him, the Hearer of whoever speaks His praise, and the Witness of whatever is done in His path. He is our Protector in this world and the next. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about the Leaf who is the daughter of the paternal aunt and her sister, upon them both be Baha’u’llah - they have always been confirmed and in truth from the beginning of the Cause until now have been occupied with the mention of God and service to God. This evanescent servant asks and hopes that God will assist them and all the Leaves, upon them be Baha’u’llah, to remain steadfast in His Cause. Verily, He answers the prayers of those who ask. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And regarding the passage you mentioned specifically for the days of Ridvan - God willing, it shall be acted upon. This matter was presented and was graced with permission. Blessed are they both. And regarding your renewed mention of the loved ones of the land of A and R, and likewise their gatherings and being set ablaze with the fire of divine love - all was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what the tongue of the All-Merciful uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance - His word, magnificent is His sovereignty:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Glorious […]</p>
<p>O friends of God in Alif and Ra! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth you with that which is better than all that hath been created on earth. Verily, your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Forgiving, the Generous. Ye have attained unto the recognition of God, the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, and the Source of His inspiration, and have drunk the choice wine sealed with His Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O friends! Praise be to God that ye have been favored with His grace in days when hearts were trembling and foundations were shaken. Through the bounty of the Lord of Names, ye turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon and were adorned with the most glorious and resplendent ornament which is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are ye and your dwellings wherein the mention of God hath been raised and over which the breezes of His grace, the Mighty, the Wondrous, have wafted.</p>
<p>Know ye the value of this exalted station and hold fast unto the cord of steadfastness, for the evil ones have been and are lying in wait. This is the Day in which the Divine Lote-Tree calleth aloud and guideth all to the most exalted Paradise. The ear is for this Day, for the call of God, exalted be His glory, is raised high and loud. And it is the Day of vision, for the lights of the Sun of Truth are manifest and brilliant from the horizon of Revelation.</p>
<p>O friends! Strive ye and call to mind the trials and tribulations which God Himself and His chosen ones have borne for your salvation. Many were the nights when the soul found no rest in the body and the eye knew no sleep. O friends! Ye have heard the taunts of the enemies in the path of God and have borne countless hardships and difficulties for His sake. Yet such stations have been inscribed for you by the Most Exalted Pen that all existence is as nothingness when compared with their mention. Today ye must preserve your stations through the Name of God, for there are many thieves who are utterly heedless of and veiled from the Truth. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon you and upon those who have believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And likewise, especially for Mirza R.F. and M.H., upon them be 966 [Baha’u’llah], wondrous and sublime Tablets have previously been revealed and sent. The relatives of His Holiness Fath-i-A’zam, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, have been and will continue to be mentioned. Blessed are they who recognize their station and act according to that which God loveth. It is hoped that these souls will all arise to teach the Cause. He will surely assist them as He assisted them before, and He is the Helper, the Mighty. If ye meet them, convey on behalf of this evanescent servant greetings and devotion to them and to all the friends in that land. Happy are they who have drunk the wine of recognition from the cups of the utterance of their Lord, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Ardakan, your honor should return once more to that land and give glad tidings of His grace and favor to the friends of God, and convey greetings from the True One to the steadfast, firm and resolute souls. As commanded, if you meet his honor Ra and Jim, upon them be the Glory of God, convey greetings and say: Ever remind the people of this blessed word which shines like the sun from the horizon of the divine Tablet: “Return to the Sacred Texts, O people of insight!” Today all must see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears. The ears of the world and the eyes of the nations will not suffice them. They must stand firm in the Cause through the power of Truth. Today is the day of utterance - awaken the heedless people and guide them to the Most Exalted Horizon. Your mention has been and is before the Wronged One. God willing, may you be assisted to do what is befitting. Take hold of the reins of the people of that land lest they become heedless and slip from the path. The Supreme Pen has informed all of the appearance of deceivers and barkers, and whatever has been revealed from the Supreme Pen has come to pass and will come to pass. Say: Consider what the All-Merciful has revealed before. He has informed you of what has appeared and will appear. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth in a mighty Book. Say: Look not to creation and what lies therein, but look to the Truth and His manifestation and sovereignty. He suffices you, and He is the Powerful, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Wise. Whatever reaches those parts, your honor should take note. Say: The world and all within it have no permanence. Strive that you may attain to the station which God, exalted be His glory, has ordained for His loved ones. The earth and all upon it shall perish, but that which has been sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds, shall endure. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained to what God, the Mighty, the Great, has desired.</p>
<p>If you meet them, convey this servant’s greetings and say that God willing, they should arise with complete dedication. Be not grieved by what has befallen your honor. Verily He does not allow the reward of the workers and doers of good to be lost. All matters are evident and manifest. God willing, may the sleeping ones arise at your mention and arise to serve the Cause, that is, succeed in teaching. This is the most important of all matters. Verily He assists whom He wishes by His command, and He is the Generous, the Powerful, the Mighty. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Praised.</p>
<p>Deliver one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet revealed in the form of a prayer specifically for Haji Malik Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may they drink the Kawthar of steadfastness from the divine chalices of utterance and attain to what God loves. This ephemeral one also sends greetings to them. As commanded, some should recite the prayer. Verily He will assist them and draw them near to God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>Regarding the letters sent from the land of Kha that were mentioned again - whatever their owners have sent as gifts and intended to be sent to the Most Holy Court, send them; and whatever they send as Huquq, there is no objection to selling it.</p>
<p>And regarding the place of blessing, whatever his honor Afnan, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory, deems advisable is beloved. And this is a word that was heard before from the blessed tongue.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! The Wronged One declares with the utmost joy and fragrance that if thou shouldst travel to certain lands, there is and hath been no harm in it. Under all conditions, keep thine eyes fixed upon the glory of the Cause and place thy trust in Him. When the soul becometh refined, that in itself is effective. Today thou must remind all the friends of God of pleasing conduct, goodly words and praiseworthy deeds, for the triumph of God’s Cause hath been and shall ever be through such means. Time and again thy call hath been honored to reach Our ears, and thy reply hath flowed without cease from the Most Exalted Pen. Be thou thankful and numbered among those who praise. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Master ’Ali-Akbar-i-Banna, upon him be the Glory of God (669), sent a letter to this servant some time ago, and likewise to Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the Glory of God (669). Both were presented at the Most Holy Court. Blessed is he in that he hath been mentioned before the Throne and there hath been revealed for him that which beareth witness to God’s grace, bounty, mercy and favors. God willing, henceforth a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet shall be revealed and sent specifically for him. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to him. May God grant that he be aided in all conditions to remember and praise the Best-Beloved of the worlds. The most important of all matters today hath been and is the teaching of God’s Cause. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto this most holy and most exalted station. His mention hath been and is before this evanescent one. It is hoped that something may be written to serve him as well. The Command is in God’s hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon thee and upon him and upon every servant who hath rent asunder the veils of idle fancy through the name of his Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and hath witnessed what God, the Lord of the worlds, hath witnessed. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>=== END BH00090 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00091 ===</p>
<p>O Muhammad-i-Qabil-i-Baqir of Naraq!</p>
<p>He is the Most Great, the Most Holy, the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is unique in His might and peerless in His grandeur, Who uttered the Word amongst all created things whereupon the mountains were moved, the heaven of the vain imaginings of the people of error was cleft asunder, the earth of idle fancies was made to sink, and the sun of certitude shone forth on the appointed day. Exalted is He Who hath appeared and caused to appear, Who hath spoken and caused to speak. He is indeed the One through Whom the gate of the Divine Presence was opened and the ocean of reunion surged in the kingdom of creation. Say: He is indeed the One established upon the Most Great Throne, Who judgeth with pure truth and calleth mankind unto God. Blessed is he who is attracted by the call of the Lord, who turneth unto Him, detached from all else, who taketh the choice wine of immortality from the hands of the people of Baha and drinketh it in the name of God, the Creator of heaven. The Concourse on High, even the dwellers of the cities of names, circle round him. And shame upon him who casteth the Lord behind his back, who followeth the vain imaginings of men, and turneth away from the Supreme Horizon. He is of those from whom the denizens of the fire dissociate themselves - they who denied the All-Merciful when the horizon of utterance was illumined with the sun of the remembrance of God, the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made known unto him who turned unto Him that which lay concealed within the pavilion of His protection, and aided him to turn towards this Horizon wherefrom the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. By God! The appointed time hath passed, and the Promised One hath appeared with a sovereignty that neither the veils of glory nor the ranks of men who have clung to their desires and denied God, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, can withstand.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter reached this evanescent servant. I took it, opened it, and found therein the fragrance of thy sincerity towards God, thy turning unto His horizon, and thy standing firm in the service of His Cause, His remembrance and His praise. When I perceived its fragrance and recognized its contents, I repaired to the Most Exalted Goal and attained the presence of the throne of our Lord, the Lord of Names, and presented what was therein before His Face. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke that which caused the Pen to swoon. How can this evanescent one be capable of mentioning that which was uttered by the Tongue of Eternity? By the life of God! The pens of creation are powerless to recount or enumerate it, and the tongues of the world fall short of its description and praise. Blessed are ye for having attained unto the remembrance of the Beloved, by which hearts and minds have taken flight. We beseech God to assist you and aid you in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to provide you with the wondrous, fresh, heavenly food which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds Who hath made His friends steadfast in His Cause, from whom the fragrance of divine love is wafting and flowing. Blessed are ye for having attained on this Day of God that which most of mankind hath failed to attain. We hope that at all times ye will drink from the living waters and bestow them upon the dead in the valley of bewilderment and heedlessness, that perchance through its drops they may attain unto a wondrous and glorious life and arise to make good what they have missed. This is a Day wherein all atoms proclaim the praise of the Lord of Names and Attributes. The Truth, exalted be His praise and glorified be His station, hath testified that this Day hath no peer or likeness. In such wise, the station of those souls who have recognized it and attained unto it is evident and manifest, requiring no mention. Yet we beseech God, exalted and mighty be He, that the heedless souls who have been seized by slumber may become aware through the call of His loved ones and not remain deprived of the heavenly waters in this spiritual morn. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is indeed the Single, the One, the Bestower, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>As to what ye wrote concerning the divine philosophers and true sages who have, praise be to God, through His infinite favors turned towards the Dayspring of divine revelation and have drunk from the choice wine of the irfan of the Beloved of the worlds - all these matters were presented in detail at the Most Holy Court. The Sun of favor hath dawned upon each one, and some time ago their petitions were also forwarded through Hadba by His Honour Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and were presented before His presence. A specific response was revealed from the heaven of divine will for each one and was dispatched. On behalf of this lowly one, convey to each of them greetings, salutations and congratulations, and say: Blessed are ye for having attained unto that which was recorded in God’s scrolls and concealed in the treasury of His all-encompassing knowledge. All the appointed times, promises and signs that were in the former books have been made manifest.</p>
<p>In one of the Divine Tablets revealed to the new believers of Kha, these exalted words are recorded - exalted be His glory: The divine promises recorded in the Holy Books have all been fulfilled. The Law of God has flowed from Zion and the Call of God has been raised from Jerusalem. Its lands and mountains have been adorned with the effulgences of the lights of the Lord. Blessed is he who ponders on that which hath been revealed in the Books of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>O friends of God! Reflect and with attentive ears hearken unto the Word of God, that through His grace and mercy ye may drink from the pure water of steadfastness and be firm and immovable as mountains in the Cause of God. Verily the Cause is mighty, mighty, and this Day is mighty, mighty. In the Book of Isaiah it is stated: “Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of His majesty.” Should one reflect upon this verse alone, he would become aware of the greatness of the Cause and the majesty of this Day of God. And at the end of the aforementioned verse it states: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.”</p>
<p>This is the Day in which the throne of David hath been adorned by the Promised Countenance, and this is the Day the mention of which hath been recorded by the Pen of Command in all the Books. There is not a single verse but proclaimeth this Name, nor a Book but testifieth to this most evident Remembrance. Were We to mention that which hath been revealed in the Books and Scriptures concerning this Revelation, this Tablet would assume enormous proportions.</p>
<p>Today all must be confident in the divine favors and strive with the utmost wisdom to teach the Cause, that all may be illumined by the lights of the dawn of inner meanings.</p>
<p>I beseech and implore God to preserve them in His protection and care, and enable them to hearken unto His Call, for in truth whosoever attaineth unto hearing the Call of God will never stray from the path of His Cause, and will regard all cries and clamors, voices and shouts, screams and braying as mere nothingness. That most of the followers of religions have not yet attained this most great bounty is due to their not having truly understood their own Book.</p>
<p>The purpose of all divine Books is the recognition of the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Dawning-Place of His Cause. This is that most mighty matter at the mention of which most souls have been thunderstruck and bewildered. All the laws and ordinances recorded in the Books revolve around the recognition of God, for if one attaineth not unto the recognition of God, all his deeds have been and will be as scattered dust.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the Book of Isaiah it is recorded: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with[…]”</p>
<p>And I cannot bear your sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies, and your festivals are mere corruption. Your new moons and your feasts my soul hateth; they are a burden unto me; I am weary to bear them.</p>
<p>If one reflects upon these quoted passages and verses that have been written from the Book of Isaiah, and detaches from the means, focusing on the Maker of Means, and then accepts whatever appears from Him as the means and holds fast to it… Those souls who have conveyed the news of the advancing sages and those who have drunk from the Kawthar of knowledge to the souls dwelling in Jerusalem would do well to observe these passages, that they may know with certainty that God doeth whatsoever He willeth. One day He commands sacrifice, and another day He removes that decree. He shall not be asked of His doings, and He is the All-Knowing Questioner. Observe how much these passages conflict with what is in the possession of this people. In any case, today is the day when all these matters have been lifted away, and the new Law of God has flowed forth from the Finger of Divine Providence. He is the true Zion, and in Zion and Jerusalem this call has been raised, and God’s mountain has become the seat of the Throne. Blessed is the ear that hath heard, the heart that hath recognized, the sense that hath perceived, and the eye that hath seen in these days of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Were this servant to wish to present to the friends the allusions and references in previous Books, he would need to spend much time writing, but time is lacking, for verily the servant is engaged in a momentous task, as he writeth down that which descendeth from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the All-Knowing Revealer. Say: O masters! Today is that Day when all things have been transformed - brother hath shunned brother, father hath dissociated from son, and likewise son from father. How many friends whose bonds of fellowship were severed because of the Word of God, and how many distant ones who drew near, and how many near ones who became distant! How many thirsty ones remained bewildered in the deserts of error and perished, and how many of them made their way to the Most Great Ocean, attained unto it and drank therefrom! This is the Day wherein kinship is not observed. The souls who have accepted are both fathers and sons, for they walk on one path, drink from one wine, gaze toward one horizon, and dwell in one house. Their relationship is made firm through the Name of God. Blessed are they and those who love them. This is the Day when the earthquakes have seized the tribes of the earth, and people are seen fallen upon the ground. They speak but have no awareness; they walk but are deprived of spirit; they have ears but are forbidden to hear; they are gathered blind, appear deaf, and are observed to be dumb. Say: This is the Day when all trees are in rapture and ecstasy, and the nightingales in melody and joy. No fresh eye remains to observe the fresh world. The eyes have grown old and lost their power, for the ophthalmia of desire hath made them sick. Otherwise, they would observe the mountains, deserts, sands, rocks, hills, plains, stars, and heavens all in rapture, longing and ecstasy. In one of the Persian utterances which hath been revealed by the Divine Pen specifically for someone, this blessed word appears: “O sons of knowledge! The eyelid, with all its delicacy, veils the eye from seeing the world […]”</p>
<p>Consider and observe: In one of the Persian utterances which flowed from the Divine Pen specifically for an individual, these blessed words appear: “O sons of knowledge! The lid of the physical eye, delicate as it is, can deprive it from beholding the world and all that is therein. Consider then what would happen if the veil of greed were to descend upon the eye of the heart!”</p>
<p>Say to those wise ones who have turned to God - upon them be the Glory of God - on behalf of this servant, that ye are those souls of whom Isaiah the Prophet gave tidings in the sixty-fifth chapter. For ye have drunk from the Living Waters while your companions remained deprived, and ye have attained the eternal bounty while your fellow believers were forbidden. Thus it is that in the Book of Isaiah He says: “Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.”</p>
<p>Observe how He even foretold that oaths would change in that Day, as He says: “He who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”</p>
<p>Ponder deeply on these passages. In Iraq, some said, “These people have even changed their oaths, swearing by the truth of Truth - such an oath has never been heard before.” Thus did their souls beguile them in their matter, and they are a people in denial. They were heedless that whatsoever was recorded in the Books must needs be made manifest. By thy life, O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! They are deaf, they are blind, they know not, they hear not, they perceive not, they understand not, and they see not. Woe unto them and unto those who follow their vain desires! I testify that they are the losers.</p>
<p>Most of the people of the world cling to their own desires, imagining themselves to be turning toward the truth. If the Hand of Divine Power should rend asunder one veil, they would take up other veils for themselves, whereby they remain deprived of the Lord of Names and the Creator of Heaven. All souls have been promised the Day of God and have been given the promise of the manifestation of Truth, as mentioned countless times in the Qur’an, the Bayan, and the heavenly Books. This is the foundation of the Book and its essence. Nevertheless, none has understood this station. Rather, they have objected to the Dawning Place of Revelation and the Dayspring of Inspiration, saying that He has claimed Divinity. Yet if the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken otherwise, they should have objected, for this is the Day of God - naught can be mentioned or shall be mentioned save the Truth and Its manifestations. Fie upon them for following their desires and denying God, our Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p>The followers of the Qur’an, both high and low, learned and ignorant, did for twelve hundred years repeat vain and false utterances and speak words devoid of meaning. Thus from the beginning of Islam until the present time, they continually spoke of the Qa’im as dwelling in Jabulqa with his sons and wives, and that whosoever should say He would be born is a liar and calumniator, nay, an infidel. Then did God, exalted be His glory, His majesty and His power, rend asunder the veil, and all beheld and heard that He appeared from Persia and was born of a mother. Now ponder how all these divines, scholars, philosophers, men of letters and mystics were heedless of the truth, wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies - fancies which became the cause of the martyrdom of the Point of the Bayan, may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him. And now certain souls who have no knowledge whatsoever and yet count themselves among the people of the Bayan are occupied with false claims of succession and spurious assertions of vicegerency, perchance to prevent the weak from recognizing the truth and to nourish them with vain and profitless imaginings. Consider now how heedless they are and how far they have strayed from the straight path. We hope that the people of Baha will attain to such a station that they will regard all these sayings and utterances as utter nothingness and absolute void, and will hold fast to the firm cord of “thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank” and cling to the hem of the blessed words “the Kingdom on that day shall be God’s”. These are they who are accounted among the people of Baha, concerning whom He saith that they dwell in the Crimson Ark. By the Sun of the horizon of the Bayan! Such vain imaginings have appeared from the direction of the false ones that man is struck with wonderment.</p>
<p>In brief, they who today have turned away from the Truth among the people of the Bayan are observed to be a hundred thousand degrees lower than the people of the Qur’an, and are uttering the same words which were uttered throughout twelve hundred years by this false band. All must ponder on what hath been mentioned. The wine of steadfastness is today more precious and more beloved than all else. It must be offered with the utmost wisdom that the friends may drink thereof and not stumble at the utterances of the polytheists. I beseech God to preserve all through His power and to raise His loved ones to the most exalted station, that they may behold none save Him, hear naught but His voice, and turn to none but Him. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Answerer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>The Primal Point, may the life of all else be a sacrifice unto Him, hath spoken thus concerning the Beauty of the Ancient of Days, that He, from eternity unto eternity, declareth “Verily I am God, there is none other God but Me; O My creation, worship ye Me!” Now observe this blessed word and consider the vain imaginings of the people, even to where He saith: Let not the mention of Prophet or Successor or aught else veil you, nor deprive you from the Dawning-Place of the divine Manifestation, for He is the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. All have been created for His revelation. He hath spoken of this matter in such wise that the pen is powerless to describe it. He, verily, beareth witness unto His own Self by His own Self. He is the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We beseech God to aid all to stand firm in His Cause and to be detached from all else besides Him. Verily, He is the Protector of them that are nigh unto Him, the sincere ones and the obedient.</p>
<p>They who were mentioned in your book - for each one separately from the heaven of the Divine Will have blessed verses been revealed. God willing, may all attain unto them and cling to the hem of His grace. Likewise, for those souls who had written petitions, for each one separately was revealed and sent a wondrous and exalted Tablet. Praise be to God that mention of all hath been made in the Most Great Scene and they have attained unto and been honored by the lights of His countenance. Upon them be the glory of God and His mercy, the loving-kindness of God and His bounty. His words, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Loving, from this renowned Prison. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Generous. Thy mention hath come before the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of the Divine Robe throughout the world. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Giving, the Merciful. He maketh mention of His loved ones in the Most Great Prison and calleth them unto a station revealed in the Scriptures of God, the Lord of all worlds. Hold thou fast unto the cord of steadfastness and cling to the hem of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We make mention of everyone who hath desired My presence, soared in the atmosphere of My nearness, and spoken in praise of My Beautiful Name. Say: By God! The Fountain of Life hath appeared and been circulated by the fingers of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Draw ye nigh through His Most Great Name and partake thereof in remembrance of His All-Wise Name. Thus hath the Wronged One spoken while in the midst of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! The Lamp hath appeared when the world was wrapped in manifest darkness. Among the people are those who have seen, turned towards it and attained unto the light of the Cause. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. And among them are those who have shunned it, turned away and sought to extinguish it. Thereupon the hand of thy Lord’s will, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, prevented them. Blessed art thou for having drawn nigh and turned towards Him when every heedless and remote one turned away. Say: O people! By God! The horizon of the world hath been illumined by the Most Great Luminary. Leave behind what ye possess and turn with enlightened hearts unto the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherefrom hath been raised the call of God, the Lord of Names. He is indeed the All-Speaking, the All-Wise. Say: This is the Path of God amongst you. Draw ye nigh and be not of those who turn aside. Beware lest the affairs of the world hold you back from the Lord of all creation. Thus doth the Prisoner make mention of you in this manifest stronghold.</p>
<p>O Ancient Beauty! Turn from this Most Pure Station and Most Great Scene towards him who was named Muhammad-i-Baqir and give him the glad tidings of the verses of his Lord through which the ocean of bounty hath surged and the fragrance of the Beloved hath wafted among the servants. By My life! The gate of heaven hath been opened by the key of My Most Glorious Name, and the horizon of divine knowledge hath been illumined by the Sun of the utterance of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place your trust in God. Verily, He ordaineth what He pleaseth for whomsoever He pleaseth. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. He calleth betwixt earth and heaven and summoneth all unto a station which the All-Merciful hath revealed in His Tablets. Thus hath the Tongue of Antiquity spoken amongst the peoples. He is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned by His Most Exalted Pen while the Promised One was imprisoned in the most remote of lands.</p>
<p>O My Pen! From this forbidden place turn towards him who hath been named Nasrullah (Aqa Siyyid Nasrullah), that he may arise to serve his Lord in all things and celebrate the praise of his Lord at eventide and at dawn. O Nasrullah! Be true to thy name, that there may appear from thee that which will cause thy mention to endure throughout the eternity of God, the Lord of all men. Reflect upon God’s grace and bounty, that He remembereth thee from this spot which hath been designated the Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Give thanks that thy name hath been honored from this spot wherein the Beloved calleth aloud with the most exalted call and guideth all to the most exalted station. Thus hath the Divine Lote-Tree spoken, and the Cock of the Throne hath crowed, when it was saddened by that which the hands of the servants had wrought.</p>
<p>A remembrance from Us unto him who hath turned unto God and heard His most sweet call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The Promise hath come and the Promised One hath appeared, yet the people are lost in doubts and idle fancies. Beseech God to rend asunder the veils of the world and draw them nigh unto the station which in the Qur’an hath been named the Praised Station. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the Day of God and acted according to that which God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, hath commanded.</p>
<p>O Javad (Aqa Siyyid Javad)! We make mention of thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord and remember Him amongst His servants, that they may recognize that which hath appeared in creation and turn unto God, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad, that he may rejoice in the verses of his Lord and be of the thankful. Hearken unto the call of God which hath been raised from the blessed white spot: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” The world hath been honored by the advent of the Lord of Eternity, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: Open your eyes! By God, the Most Exalted Horizon hath been illumined and the Lord of Names hath appeared with mighty sovereignty. We counsel thee and My loved ones to manifest great steadfastness, for Satan calleth and inviteth the people to the very foundation of hell. Be steadfast in the Cause of God through His might and power. Thus doth the Pen of Command enjoin you from the presence of the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>A book from Us unto him who hath heard the Call and turned unto God, the Lord of the worlds. O Hasan (Hasan Aqa)! Mention hath been made of thee before the Throne, and there have been sent down for thee these verses whereby all things have been attracted and the Dove of the Cause hath warbled upon the twigs of the Ultimate Tree. Thus doth the Wronged One make mention of thee that thou mayest be of them that remember. By God! The tongue hath been created for My remembrance, hearts for My knowledge, and eyes to behold the lights of My manifestations which have encompassed the worlds. This is the Day of God wherein every atom proclaimeth: The Worshipped One hath appeared with a sovereignty that hath encompassed those who are in the heavens and on earth. Hold fast unto the cord of God and leave those who have denied the verses of God when they were sent down in truth. Verily thy Lord is the Counsellor, the All-Informed. This is a Tablet through which the Kingdom of Utterance hath shone forth, and wherein We make mention of him who hath turned unto God, the Lord of mankind, that the attraction of his Lord’s verses may seize him and render him steadfast in this Cause whereby hearts have been perturbed and feet have slipped.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Baqir (Aqa Mirza Muhammad)! Thou art in thy place while the Best-Beloved of the world remembereth thee from His Most Great Prison. Know thou this and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. By God! We, at all times, summon the servants unto the Most Merciful. Among them are those who have heard and responded, and those who have witnessed yet denied and followed every doubtful objector. Say: Have vain imaginings prevented you from the Lord of all days, or idle fancies from My Hidden Name? Remember, then be fair, and follow not every ignorant infidel. By God! He hath appeared with the truth, and circling round Him are the Concourse on High and those who were created from the light of their Lord, the Subduer of the winds. Thus have We made thee to hear and have answered thee through Our grace, for We are the Powerful, the All-Bountiful. O thou servant who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Read thou unto each one of My loved ones that which hath been sent down for him from the heaven of the will of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Remind all of God’s favors and bounties, and give them the glad-tidings of this grace which hath no equal in all creation. God willing, thou shouldst, with the utmost joy and fragrance, recite the verses sent down from the heaven of the will of the Most Merciful unto each of the mentioned loved ones, that all may witness the Sun of bounty and engage in praise and thanksgiving to the Beloved of the world.</p>
<p>And furthermore, in the letter of the noble Haji Kamalu’d-Din, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, Dr.&nbsp;Hezekiel Haim had posed two questions. First, he mentioned that in previous Books the sacrifice of God was Isaac, while in the Qur’an this station was revealed in the name of Ishmael, meaning that the station of being God’s sacrifice is recorded in the Qur’an in his name. What he asks is the truth without doubt, but all souls must fix their gaze upon the Word that has dawned from the horizon of divine utterance, and every soul must ponder its sovereignty, its penetrating influence, its power and its all-encompassing nature. There is no doubt that these matters have been realized and established through the Word of God, and the Word of God is the overseer of all things. It is the creator of the world and the educator of the world. It is that which summons those who thirst in the valley of separation to the ocean of reunion, and it is that which illumines the darkness of ignorance with the dawn of knowledge. Consider how all people who lived in the past affirmed that Isaac was the sacrifice, and likewise the followers of the Qur’an have affirmed this station for Ishmael, even though it is clear and evident to every person of insight and understanding that, outwardly, no sacrifice actually took place, and by universal agreement, it was an animal that was sacrificed. Now ponder what is the cause and reason that one who went to the altar of the Friend and was not sacrificed was honored with the mantle of being God’s sacrifice and attained the ornament of divine acceptance. There is no doubt that it was through the Word of God that he attained this station and was honored with this most great bestowal. Therefore, the appearance, manifestation, establishment and realization of all names, things and stations depend upon and are contingent on the Word of God. Likewise, there is no doubt that the Unknowable Essence does not speak directly, for It has been and ever will be sanctified above known conditions and mentioned signs. Rather, It speaks through the tongue of Its Manifestations, just as the Torah was revealed through the tongue of Moses, and God, exalted be His glory, mentioned all the laws of that time through the tongue of Him Who conversed with God. The same is true of other Holy Books which outwardly appeared from the tongue of the Prophets and Messengers, while in all cases the Speaker and Utterer was God - exalted be His glory, universal be His bounty, mighty be His power, and great be His station. From what has been mentioned, it is established and proven that the station of being God’s sacrifice was bestowed upon Isaac according to what is in previous Books through the word of Abraham, peace be upon him, and that same word appeared and became manifest in the Qur’anic Dispensation from the Dawning-Place of divine verses and the Dayspring of divine revelation regarding Ishmael.</p>
<p>Man must reflect upon the Self of Truth. After attaining certitude, whatsoever He ordains is beloved and acceptable, and none may say why or wherefore. This is a matter whose mysteries may not be divulged at this time, for all people are deprived of its foundation - that is to say, they have not truly comprehended the divine purpose in the revealed Books, but have contented themselves with whatever they have deduced from or heard from their divines. Should anyone transgress even slightly from these theological limitations, they pronounce him an infidel. This fact is evident to you and to all fair-minded souls. One cannot yet say to the followers of the Qur’an that the promised Qa’im has appeared contrary to their vain imaginings, for if this were said, they would arise in utter opposition, as indeed they have done. The Beloved declares: By My life! If God wished to honor those on earth with that glorious station and beloved name, He would be able to do so through a single word from His presence. He is verily the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. The conditions of creation cannot prevent Him, nor can the utterances of every heedless and remote soul. Fix your gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon and illumine your hearts with the lights of the countenance of your Lord, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. Thus doth the Wronged One counsel you, when most of the servants have turned away from Him and every iniquitous doubter hath opposed Him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the Prophets - they who have been the Dawning-Places of divine revelation and the Daysprings of divine inspiration - there are stations which names cannot access. They are all seen as one soul, for they speak but one word and stand firm upon one cause. Blessed is he who immerseth himself in this vast ocean whose shores none hath reached, how much less its depths. This is the station of the Sun of unity and the Ocean of oneness. Should a soul ascend and soar in this holy, sublime atmosphere, he would testify to all that the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Books, and would cling to it with complete certitude and assurance. This station hath been revealed in detail by the Supreme Pen in some of the Books revealed in this Most Great Manifestation. Blessed are they that are informed thereof and they that comprehend.</p>
<p>The second question concerns the blessed verse of the Qurqan which states, exalted be His station and His sovereignty: “And remember when Jesus, son of Mary, said: ‘O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the messenger of Allah unto you, confirming that which was (revealed) before me in the Torah, and bringing good tidings of a messenger who cometh after me, whose name is Ahmad.’ Yet when he came unto them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is mere magic.’”</p>
<p>Their question concerns the fact that this passage was not and is not in the Gospel, yet the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him, mentioned it in the Qurqan. Yes, this is true and we acknowledge it, but He did not say it was revealed in the Gospel. We testify that He said Jesus son of Mary spoke what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qurqan. Assuredly, whatsoever He spoke and was revealed in the Qurqan from the All-Merciful was and ever shall be the pure truth, for none but God has knowledge of hidden sciences and comprehension of what has occurred and shall occur in creation. God, exalted be His station, reveals and teaches to His chosen ones and His Prophets whatsoever He willeth. He is verily the All-Wise Teacher.</p>
<p>This blessed revealed verse is among those matters that God, exalted be His station, informed His Messenger about. That it is not in the Gospel does not prove that Christ did not speak the content of the mentioned verse, for the four Gospels were written after Him. John, Luke, Mark and Matthew - these four wrote after Christ such utterances of His as they remembered, so that His followers might occupy themselves with reading and reflecting upon them. Many of His utterances had been erased from their memory, and many statements He made none of these souls had heard. None knows what Christ spoke save He Who sent Him, taught Him and strengthened Him. None but God, exalted be His knowledge, has ever had or shall have knowledge of all the affairs of the world. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing, the Omniscient, the Almighty. All atoms testify that His knowledge has preceded all things and encompasses all, for He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Manifest, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen declares that God, exalted be His glory, in every Dispensation has confirmed His previously revealed Books. Thus did the Messenger of God, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, confirm the Torah and the Gospel. Likewise in this Dispensation the Qurqan and other holy books have been confirmed. However, the Torah that God has accepted comprises the very words that flowed from the tongue of Moses from God. This matter has now been briefly mentioned. Should God, exalted be His glory, will it, it shall flow in detail from the Supreme Pen hereafter.</p>
<p>This servant, the attendant, hopes that the friends of God who have drunk from the wine of inner meanings and who dwell in that land will arise in perfect unity to love God and mention and praise Him. Unity is the mightiest pillar today - it is the cause of the exaltation, spread and elevation of God’s Cause. Blessed are they who have held fast to the cord of unity and followed what they were commanded by God, the Lord of creation.</p>
<p>=== END BH00091 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00092 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>How glorious is the victory of God! He hath raised His Banner - verily He is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth - to the most exalted station in all the world. Its abasement is the source of all glory, and its defeat the sovereign of all triumphs. They have indeed suffered loss who denied God’s power and sovereignty, who broke His Covenant, who disbelieved in His signs, who strove to extinguish His light, and who rejected that which He brought forth in His days. Exalted is the King, the Single, the True, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting, and exalted is His sovereignty that overshadoweth all that was and will be.</p>
<p>He brought the world into being through His Word, and caused the rivers of meaning and utterance to flow therein. Through His blessed Name He opened the gate of the Kingdom and summoned all on earth unto it. How many souls were veiled from beholding the effulgences of the lights of unity as a consequence of their deeds, and how many turned away from all else save God and attained unto the shelter of His grace. He is the One with power Who with the finger of His will rent asunder the thick veils and tore away the august coverings. The hosts of the world are powerless to prevent Him, and the ranks of nations deserve no mention. He exalteth whomsoever He willeth. He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, Who doeth what He willeth by His sovereignty. Verily He is the One Whom all desire, in both beginning and end.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose light the horizons of meaning and utterance were illumined, and through Whose Name the heaven of knowledge was adorned with the stars of remembrance and exposition. I beseech Thee by Thy power, Thy might, Thy sovereignty, Thy glory, Thy grandeur, and Thy dominion to ordain for Thy loved ones, from the Pen of Thy bounty, that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and give them to drink from the cup of bestowal through Thy Name and Thy grace. O my Lord! Thou seest them gazing toward Thy horizon and clinging to the cord of Thy generosity. Thou beholdest, O my God, their eyes expectant of the wondrous tokens of Thy mercy, and their hands raised toward the heaven of Thy bounty. O Lord! Disappoint them not of that which befitteth Thy generosity and favors, and withhold them not from the effulgences of the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Thou seest him who hath traversed the lands to exalt Thy Word and Thy remembrance, and who hath borne hardships in Thy days. I beseech Thee to aid him in all conditions through the manifestations of Thy strength and power, and the daysprings of Thy might and authority. Verily Thou hast power over whatsoever Thou willest, and verily Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Beloved of my heart! The successive letters, like unto rain, have watered and refreshed the gardens of existence. Praise be to God Who enabled you to send them and enabled Me to read the remembrances contained therein. After perusal they were brought to the Most Great Throne and presented before the face of the Lord of all beings. In each instance there descended from the heaven of the grace of the Lord of Oneness that which the peoples of the world are powerless and incapable of mentioning, until in this instance, after their presentation in the Most Holy and Exalted Court, these sublime words shone forth from the Dayspring of Will. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Numerous letters from you have arrived and all attained the honor of being heard in the presence of the Wronged One. Praise and gratitude be unto Him for having enabled you to turn unto Him, to acknowledge and recognize Him, to direct yourself towards Him, to hearken unto Him, and to stand firm in a Cause at which the lions of the world trembled, save those whom God, thy Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise, wished otherwise.</p>
<p>The destroyers of the worlds of meaning and utterance are those souls whom neither the might of princes nor the doubts and suspicions of the divines could debar from the Lord of Names or deprive of the ocean of the Ever-Flowing Grace. Allah is Most Great! Such souls have no peer or likeness. All divine Books, both of the past and present, bear witness to the loftiness and sublimity of the station of these assured souls. Blessed is the one adorned with the ornament of steadfastness and attained unto the robe of faithfulness.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to the party of God. Say: Be not content to occupy yourselves with vain and profitless matters like the former people. Throughout ages and centuries they were worshippers of idols and pursuers of vain imaginings, yet deemed themselves the most exalted and excellent of all creatures. Night and day they would beseech God, glorified be His majesty, with utmost supplication and entreaty for the appearance of the Lord of all beings. Yet when the gate of reunion was opened and the hidden mystery dawned forth from the horizon of the unseen, and the ocean of utterance surged, both the learned and the ignorant arose in opposition. Glory be to God! They attained not unto a single drop from the ocean of divine revelation and insight. Take heed, O ye who are endowed with understanding!</p>
<p>Now again the people of the Bayan are engaged in the same vain imaginings. At times they speak of alteration, at times of successor, at times of mirror and beyond. Say: O ye ignorant ones! For one thousand two hundred years and more ye were occupied with these causes - bring forth the fruit thereof that it may become manifest to all the worlds. Yea, its fruit was that ye engaged in reviling the Sovereign of existence and ultimately pronounced death sentence upon His most pure blood. Would that the world had never been created and such a grievous wrong had never appeared! The Jews seek refuge in God from the oppression of that party, and likewise do other peoples. Say: This is the Day of true unity. The Sun of Manifestation is shining from the horizon of the heaven of grace, manifest and evident. The mention of aught else besides God was not and is not permitted. Those who cling to names have newly devised fresh remembrances for the dawning-place of vain imaginings. They have indeed lost who denied the signs and evidences of God, and rejected His proof and testimony. They are assuredly among the transgressors in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to all the kindred and those of the House of Justice, and give them glad tidings of God’s favors. The Mother of the near ones has ascended and has attained unto that which none among the handmaidens of the earth have attained, save whom God willeth, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who hearken to thy words concerning this Most Great Cause and this Mighty Announcement.</p>
<p>Ever have you been and continue to be remembered in the presence of the Exalted, the Self-Sufficient. The rain pours down, the waters flow, grace is manifest, light radiates, the ocean surges, fragrance wafts, and the Sun of true unity shines forth–yet the people remain heedless and veiled. The King of being Who from the earliest days until now has arisen before the faces of the world and, with no veil or barrier, summoned all peoples to the highest horizon–from Him have the people of the Bayan turned away, clinging to new delusions a hundredfold more corrupt than the ancient delusions of the Shi’ih sect. In truth, men are bewildered, the possessors of insight are bewildered, nay all things are bewildered. That exalted Truth Whose verses have encompassed the world and Whose manifestations are evident and clear as the sun at high noon have they forsaken, clinging instead to souls who were and are unworthy of mention. Glory be to God! What heedlessness has seized the world! By the life of our Lord, the people are in grievous heedlessness and great intoxication.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Mirza Muhammad-Baqir Khan, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah]: his petition was presented before the countenance of the Lord of the worlds on the sixth day of the blessed month of Rama?an, four and a half hours after sunrise, and was honored to be heard, and this most mighty, most holy Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for him. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One to him who hath believed in God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting. He calleth with the most exalted call between earth and heaven and giveth glad tidings unto all of the manifestation of God, His sovereignty, His glory, His power, and His verses which have encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven. Hear thou the call of the Wronged One, then bear witness to that which God hath testified: that there is none other God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. I created all things for the knowledge of My Self, yet when the appointed time came and the Promised One appeared, they disbelieved in God, the Lord of all being. Say: The Law is that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and the Way is this straight and extended Path. The Truth is He Who speaketh at the midmost heart of the world before the faces of all nations. By God! The heavens have been cleft asunder, the earth hath been split, the mountains have been scattered, and all who lie in the graves have been raised up. This is a Revelation at which the limbs of all names have trembled, while tranquil were the hearts of those who recognized that which was uttered from His praiseworthy station. Say: The Law is the Law of God, did ye but know, and the Way is this Path which hath appeared with truth, did ye but recognize it. Say: O concourse of earth! Beware lest the veils of the divines shut you out from the Lord of all names, or the might of those who have disbelieved strike fear into you regarding the Witness and the Witnessed. This is the Day whereof Muhammad, the Messenger of God, gave glad tidings, and for which the One Who conversed with God [Moses] was chosen aforetime, did ye but perceive it. The servant in attendance hath presented thy letter before the Face. We have answered thee with verses that nothing in existence can equal, neither that which is possessed by kings nor subjects. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Face and won the verses of God, the Mighty, the Loving. Take it with a strength from Us and a power from Our presence and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Should Thy decree prevent me from standing before Thy gate, and Thy predestination hold me back from turning toward Thy horizon, do Thou write down for me, with Thy Most Exalted Pen, the reward of attaining Thy presence. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom the contingencies of creation cannot frustrate. Thou doest what Thou willest. Thou art, in truth, God, the All-Encompassing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have turned with radiant faces and illumined breasts toward the Most Exalted Horizon. These are, verily, the people of Baha in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that ye have attained unto that which its fragrance shall endure through the perpetuity of God’s exalted attributes. Well is it with him and fair his pleasure. This servant conveys his greetings and expresses that which conduces to the exaltation of the Word of God. From the True One, exalted be His glory, this servant beseeches and hopes that He may aid you in that which befits His days.</p>
<p>As to your mention of Aqa Muhammad and Aqa Haydar-’Ali from the people of Ya, upon them be the glory of God, and likewise your request for their remembrance in the Most Holy Court - praise be to God this hope was fulfilled and mention of them was made in the presence of the Lord of the Manifestation. His blessed and exalted Word is:</p>
<p>O people of God! Some time ago, wondrous and glorious Tablets were specifically revealed for the friends of that land and were sent through one of the Afnan, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, they will attain unto them and drink from the ocean of the utterance of the Most Merciful. O people of God! All that hath been revealed and sent down from the Supreme Pen is manifest and evident. The barking ones have assailed from all sides and, like wolves, have set upon the sheep of God. Would that one among that people would ask what became of the recompense of the previous community, namely the Shi’ihs, for what they said and did, and what was their reward on the Day of Reckoning. By the life of God! They clung to vain imaginings while counting themselves people of certitude; they were worshippers of names while deeming themselves monotheists. Fie upon them and upon what their hands have wrought! The fruit of the deeds of those spurious, rejected, heedless and false souls was denial of the Truth, as is clear and evident. Say: Verily He knoweth the treachery of eyes and what the breasts conceal.</p>
<p>With perfect unity and harmony, drink ye of the Kawthar of divine knowledge, despite those who denied God’s proof and evidence, and who uttered that for which they were cursed in this world and the next. Verily He is the Truth, there is none other God but Him, and He is the Wise Commander, the Manifest Ordainer. Recently they have clung to the cord of perversion and the like. It is incumbent and obligatory upon all the people of God to protect the weak souls from the barking of the baying ones and the doubts of the transgressors. By the life of God! The people of Baha behold all else but God as a handful of dust. They are seated upon the thrones of steadfastness and recline upon the cushions of light. Blessed are they that know.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest Thy chosen ones enkindled with the fire of Thy love, turning unto Thy horizon, and clinging to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. Praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds and the Worshipped One of the nations, for having made clear unto them the path, revealed unto them the proof, and manifested unto them that which draweth them nigh unto the ocean of Thy presence and the heaven of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Great Signs, by the manifestations of Thy power in the kingdom of creation, by the seas of meaning that were concealed within Thy verses and words, and by the Ship that moveth at times through the air, at times upon the land, and at other times upon the sea of Thy will and purpose, to aid Thy chosen ones to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that they see naught except Thee save as the darkness upon a dead ant. O my Lord! Draw them nigh unto the station wherein was raised the pavilion of Thy glory, pitched the tents of Thy Cause, and hoisted the banners of Thy victory. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Before every word of Truth - exalted be His glory, abundant be His favors, and mighty be His utterance - the books of the world bow down in humility. A hundred thousand regrets that deluded and treacherous souls are seen deprived of the Dawning Place of the Hidden Mystery. Say: Today is the springtime of bounty and today the heaven of grace is uplifted. Strive that perchance you may attain unto a mention or be honored with a service. Great is the Day, great is the Cause, and great is the bounty. Blessed are they who know, blessed are they who attain, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the barking ones - if anyone attains unto the vision of even less than a needle’s eye, they will see all these as non-existent and lost. The abundance of bounties has caused the heedlessness of the servants. By the life of our Lord! That which has been revealed is sovereign over all names and their kingdoms, attributes and their dominions, the Bayan and its loftiness, and the Furqan and its radiance. Now they sleep. Soon they will awaken at the gathering of divine verses and bear witness to their own evil deeds. O people! Fear God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Subduer. This is that Manifestation at the mention of whose name the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - uttered “I am the first of them that worship.”</p>
<p>From the ocean of divine generosity and the heaven of His bounty, We beseech and hope that He may aid all to return, that perchance the servants may not be deprived of the fragrances of the days of the Lord of creation. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Previously in thy beloved letters were petitions from certain handmaidens. The answer to each has been sent down from the heaven of divine grace. God willing, they will attain unto them and drink from the ocean of mercy. Every name that was present before the Face attained unto the verses of God. What has happened that the world remains deprived of the ocean of knowledge, the euphrates of mercy, and the tree of wisdom? To what do they cling? By the life of our Lord! Their path, their proof, their worship and their orientation have sprung from idle fancies and vain imaginings. Evil is the deed of the doubters. The Command is in God’s hand, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for the leaf Diya’u’l-Hajiyyih, upon her be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah]. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who dominates all names</p>
<p>O Leaf! God willing, thou shalt hold fast unto the Tree with such firmness that the diverse winds of the world shall not move thee nor prevent thee from the Tree. Today the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen and the rustling of the Lote-Tree are raised. Blessed are the leaves that have attained unto hearing them and are moved by the winds of God’s will, exalted be His glory. Today the emperors enter churches in the name of the Lord of creation, yet remain veiled from the Commander, the Creator, and the Goal. Likewise the queens of the world turn in nights and days toward the Ancient King and mention the Most Great Name, yet when the horizon of the heaven of manifestation was illumined with the lights of His countenance, all were seen to be heedless and remote, though in nights and days they were speaking His mention and hoping for His presence.</p>
<p>Now that leaf must, with outer and inner tongue, be engaged in praise and glorification of the Beloved of the world, for He has aided and guided. We beseech God to strengthen thee to preserve what He has bestowed. O Leaf! Know thou the worth and station of the utterance of the All-Merciful. If thou hast attained unto God’s tablet and found its fragrance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou art He Who strengthened me, made me know, taught me, and guided me to Thy straight path. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom and Sovereign of might, to aid me and Thy handmaidens in Thy remembrance and praise and in arising to serve Thy Cause. Verily Thou art God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer!</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest one of Thy leaves who hath turned toward the Tree of Thy Cause and hath set her face toward Thine all-highest horizon - the Spot wherefrom the Luminary of Thy Revelation hath shone forth, O Thou Who art the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, the mysteries of Thy Book, the suns of the horizons of Thy heaven, and the waves of the ocean of Thy Will, to aid me as Thou didst aid Thy handmaidens and leaves who turned unto Thee, believed in Thee and Thy signs, and acknowledged that which Thy Tongue did utter ere the creation of Thy earth and heaven - that there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. O my Lord! I perceive the fragrance of Thy Manifestation, yet know not upon which spot Thy throne is established. I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation and the showers from the clouds of the heaven of Thy mercy to open before the face of Thy handmaiden the door of Thy bounty and grace with the key of Thy Most Great Name, whereby the limbs of the princes who violated Thy Covenant and Testament and arose to extinguish Thy light and quench the fire of Thy Tree did tremble. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world and Desire of the nations, for having caused me to hear Thy call, to behold Thy signs, to be guided to Thy path, and to be given to drink of the Kawthar of Thy love. I beseech Thee to assist me to preserve that which Thou hast bestowed upon me through Thy bounty and generosity, O Most Merciful of the merciful, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>In My Name Which Dawneth from the Horizon of the Heaven of Utterance!</p>
<p>O My leaf and My handmaiden! Thy mention hath ever been present before the Wronged One. That which is everlasting and enduring hath been sent down for thee. Be not grieved by the happenings of the world. Hold fast unto the cord of patience and cling to the hem of resignation. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the lights of the Sun of Divine Unity and hast drunk from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s recognition. Beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to assist His handmaidens to preserve the pearls of His love, for verily the treacherous ones, the thieves, and the barking dogs lie in wait. By the life of God! They are in manifest error. From the earliest days until now the Self of God hath been in the hands of His enemies - at times imprisoned, at times in chains, and at times wandering from land to land as a captive. Yet in all conditions the scratching of the Pen was heard and the Call was raised. The heedlessness of the world did not prevent the Ancient Beauty from His purpose. Every fair-minded one beareth witness and every just one testifieth. O My handmaiden! Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of God. Say: We beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to grant success unto all and supreme steadfastness. Ye must occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, in complete sanctity and detachment, through goodly deeds and praiseworthy and pleasing character. This is the counsel of the Wronged One unto His handmaidens. The glory which shineth resplendent from the horizon of this Most Great Name be upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have turned unto God and believed in Him, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>In My Name through Which the Spheres of Utterance Have Revolved throughout Creation! […]</p>
<p>O My handmaiden, My leaf! Thy letter was presented before the Wronged One, and the servant present read it, attaining the honor of being heard by the Goal of all the worlds. Thou hast previously been blessed with the holy writings of the Supreme Pen. This station is most glorious - hold it dear. Say: O leaves, deprive not yourselves of the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree. This is the day of grace and bounty. We beseech God to adorn His handmaidens with the ornament of the Most Great Chastity and illumine them with the light of His knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Perceiving. We convey Our greetings to the handmaidens of that land and counsel them with that which befitteth the Days of God. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto hearing and hath acted upon the counsels of the Supreme Pen. All that is witnessed shall perish and become as nothing, save that which is related to God, exalted be His glory. One word from Him is better than the wealth of the world and the inheritance of nations. Well is it with the soul that hath attained unto it. The glory be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who hath turned unto God, believed, hearkened and responded to her Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for the Leaf Badi’ih, upon her be the Glory of God. He saith, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In the Name of the Compassionate, the Merciful</p>
<p>The spiritual sustenance hath been sent down from the heaven of divine favor in such wise as to astound all, and perchance due to its great bounty it remaineth concealed. Would that the people of the world might become ready and worthy to witness that which is hidden. The divine favor hath reached such a degree that every name mentioned before His presence hath been blessed with a Tablet and honored with verses. Today the ocean of grace is manifest before all faces, and the Name ‘the Concealer’ standeth before all faces, concealing that which is unseemly and mentioning that which causeth awakening and enkindlement. With Him is the knowledge of all things in a Clear Book. We convey greetings to all the handmaidens and give them glad tidings of the splendors of the Sun of Divine Providence. Blessed are the souls that are accepted, steadfast and upright. O handmaidens of God! This is the day of remembrance, praise and deeds of purity. Strive that there may appear from you that which may cause the turning of the heedless and the awakening of the sleeping ones. The Glory from Us be upon My handmaidens who have believed in the All-Informed, the One.</p>
<p>Praise and thanksgiving be unto God that He hath caused the waves of the ocean of utterance to appear and become manifest in the form of the Luminous Proof from the horizon of the crimson ark. Glory be to God! The ocean surgeth, the sun shineth, the light is radiant and resplendent; yet the heedless ones, the infidels, and the babblers remain in evident doubt. All things mock them, but they perceive it not. Man is astonished at what the deniers of the Cause have understood and comprehended. Have they not witnessed the outpourings of divine meanings, or have they not heard the cooings of the eternal Dove? From whom is life, and from whom is death?</p>
<p>In one of the Tablets, this most exalted Word hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen - blessed and exalted be His words: “Verily We have sounded the Trumpet, and it is My Most Exalted Pen, whereby We have quickened all who are in earth and heaven” unto the end of His utterance. May the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdoms of command and creation be a sacrifice unto Him.</p>
<p>May the True One, exalted be His glory, protect His loved ones. That beloved one should arise with the utmost endeavor to preserve the weak souls, lest they be afflicted with the like of former vain imaginings. At one time He said: “Say: O people of God! Ye should be so steadfast in the Cause of God that ye should regard all else as non-existent and lost. Should clamor be raised from all directions, consider it as the buzzing of a fly, nay less, did ye but know. The fragrances of verses are diffused throughout the world, and the Hand of Power is manifest with the banner ‘Verily, I am the All-Powerful.’ Say: O babblers! Roll up the carpet of idle fancies - the carpet of God is spread, and the Lord of Eternity is seated thereon. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers.”</p>
<p>By the life of our Purpose and your Purpose! The flame of divine verses and the lights of heavenly utterance have encompassed the world, yet those who are veiled remain in evident veils.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention that was made of the martyrs - upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God - and the detailed accounts of events in that land, these passages were requested by the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps. Should the authentic account, free from falsehood and conjecture, become available, let it be sent. It is most beloved, for the purpose of the Most Great Branch - may my spirit be a sacrifice unto Him - is that all that hath outwardly transpired in this Cause be recorded, that it may become the means of knowledge and awareness for the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>And concerning the mention thou didst make of Darreh-Gaz and their turning to the Most Exalted Horizon and their sanctification from all else save God, these passages were honored to be heard in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. His blessed and exalted words are […]</p>
<p>O Son of My Name! O thou who traversest the lands for My remembrance! Treacherous ones, thieves, clamorous ones and atheists have appeared throughout all regions. This is the news which flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in the earliest days. Verily He informed all of what hath appeared and what shall appear. To this beareth witness He Who speaketh at this moment that I, verily, am God, the Lord of all the worlds. We make mention of Our loved ones in Darajiz, those whom We have remembered, and We give them glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness and mercy. We remind them of what hath been revealed by My Pen in My Scriptures and Tablets, and We inform them of what hath been ordained for them as a command from Me, and I am the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days. O people of God! Ponder upon the matter of this Wronged One. From the earliest days until now He hath been afflicted in the hands of enemies. Not for a moment did He seek comfort or protection for Himself. Before the faces of princes, divines and doctors of law did He raise the Call, and summoned all to the most sublime horizon. When the light shone forth and the Cause became somewhat manifest, the opposers emerged from behind the veil with the swords of hatred, seeking to destroy the Desired One of all worlds. By the life of God! They are deprived of the ocean of divine knowledge, forbidden from the effulgences of the Sun of inner meanings, heedless of the root of the Cause and unaware. They play with their idle fancies and perceive not, and they say what the ancients never said, and they purpose what those of later times never purposed. Some of the ignorant ones have arranged objections and made them snares for the people of God. What have they understood of “He doeth what He willeth” and what have they comprehended of “He ordaineth what He pleaseth”? Every possessor of insight and fairness beareth witness to the greatness of the Cause and its exaltation, and likewise to its sanctity and detachment. We were not behind any veil. Before all faces were We manifest and evident; the Word was manifest and the deed apparent. We beseech God that He deprive not His servants of the light of the Day-Star of justice and fairness, and that He aid them to return. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is no God but Him, the Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who have drunk from the cup of steadfastness. This evanescent servant beseecheth the Eternal Truth for confirmation and success on behalf of the friends, and conveyeth to each one mention, greeting and glory. In all conditions, God willing, the victory hath been and shall be with that spiritual Beloved.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the barking ones, the transgressors, the slanderers and the oppressors - that party is not and never has been worthy of mention. Praise be to God, most of the friends attained the Desired Land and dwelt in its vicinity for extended periods, finding repose beneath the pavilions of grandeur. They saw, heard and became aware. He said: “O Son of My Name! This Cause is the Most Great Announcement. Surely it must be seen as greater and mightier than the sayings and calumnies of the polytheists of the past.” Each day one or two souls or a group would arrive in the Most Holy Land - all saw, heard and became aware. However, during this period one person was with those people on the island. Surely the details of this have reached or will reach the ears of that beloved one. Despite being in the land of England, they did not allow a single person to reside there or engage in any occupation lest they discover what they possess. In any case, the mention and deeds of this land are evident - more manifest than the sun and more elevated than the heaven. Blessed are they that behold, blessed are they that hear, and blessed are the fair-minded. The divine utterance hath been revealed to such a degree that the Mother Book and the Mother of Utterance are astounded. We beseech God to grant fairness and not deprive His servants of the light of justice. The duty is to protect the servants. And regarding the hardships you wrote about - they are true, without doubt. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that God will transform them into ease and comfort. Verily He is the Lord of humanity and the Omnipotent over what He willeth.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about it being more than two years since you wrote and this evanescent one has not been enabled to reply - indeed it is exactly as you have written. However, the heart of that beloved one bears witness that this negligence had two causes: First, the assurance that, praise be to God, that beloved heart has attained and witnessed the waves of the Most Great Sea and heard the Call of God, and the verses have reached every city in a manner that transcends the description and comprehension of the people of the world. The second cause was the multitude of occupations. He has ever said and continues to say that attention must be given to the new, fresh and wondrous saplings, and they must be watered lest they be afflicted with the disease of withering from the poisonous winds of the calumnies of the opposers. That beloved one, praise be to God, is occupied with service and stands firm in rendering assistance. The servant asks his Lord to open before your face the gates of His grace and mercy. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous, the Hearing, the Responding One.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Sadiq from among the sons of Khalil, mentioning that they intended to pay the Huquq but were subsequently not enabled to do so - these matters were raised before His presence and attained the honor of being heard. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory! The payment of the Rights of God is obligatory upon all and its ordinance hath been revealed and established by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book. However, demanding and insisting upon it is never permitted. If anyone is enabled to pay it and delivers it with joy and radiance, it is accepted; otherwise, no. By way of reminder, it should be mentioned once generally in gatherings, and that is sufficient. The assured, steadfast and insightful souls will themselves take action and act upon what hath been commanded unto them by God. The benefit of this matter returns to those souls themselves. Verily God is independent of all worlds. Let not the people of God be saddened. By the life of God! There hath been ordained for them that which the reckoners are powerless to reckon.</p>
<p>As to what that beloved one wrote concerning non-acceptance, after it was presented They uttered words of truth, for the Cause of God has been and continues to be exalted through wealth and independence. “It behooveth My loved ones to hold fast unto that whereby the Cause of God and His sovereignty may be exalted.”</p>
<p>In truth, it is exactly as that beloved one has written. This evanescent servant beseecheth the everlasting Truth to assist the loved ones - namely those who are the Hands of the Cause, who are adorned with the ornament of teaching, and who are engaged in service to the Cause - to achieve that which will exalt His Word. In these days mention was made of this matter. It is hoped that the door of grace will be opened and the hand of bounty will bestow that which will cause the elevation and ascendancy of His loved ones.</p>
<p>His honor Aqa Muhammad Ardikani, upon him be 9 6 6 [Baha’u’llah], sent a letter to this servant specifically requesting that this servant make pilgrimage on his behalf. At three hours past nightfall on Monday the fifth of the blessed month of Ramadan, intending to visit the Most Exalted Shrine and Supreme Heights, that which was intended was accomplished. After completion, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these blessed words, exalted be His glory and mighty His utterance:</p>
<p>“O servant in attendance! Praise be to God, thou hast attained and thy deed hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Give glad tidings unto him who desired to attain the presence of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He may say:</p>
<p>‘My God, my God! I have perceived the fragrance of Thy Revelation and have turned to the Mount of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy wisdom and knowledge, by the verses of Thy Book and their mysteries, and by the hearts of Thy loved ones, their radiance and their light, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will benefit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds and draw me nigh unto Thee. Thou knowest, O my God and my Lord, that I know not what profiteth or harmeth me. Verily Thou seest and knowest and hearest, and Thou art the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.’”</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they have attained that which is the goal of those near unto God and the desire of the sincere ones. This evanescent one beseecheth the Truth to assist them and confirm them in such wise that they may hold fast unto the Truth alone and be detached from all else. This is the station of true unity that hath been manifested in this Revelation. A hundred thousand blessings upon those who yearn and act.</p>
<p>In previous letters from that beloved of the heart, certain names were mentioned. Each hath been blessed with divine verses and illumined by the lights of the utterance of the All-Merciful. By the life of our Purpose and your Purpose! After mention of the names, the ocean of divine utterance surged in such wise that tongues and pens are powerless to describe it. As commanded, convey greetings to all and give them glad tidings of that which hath been revealed for them from the Most Exalted Pen. It is hoped that the horizons of those regions will be illumined with the light of unity and concord, and all will act as befitteth. Repeatedly hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken this exalted word: “O people of God! Let not the time slip away from you. Know ye its value. By the life of God! All the centuries and ages cannot equal a single moment of these days. This is that which God hath testified when He was established upon His Most Great Throne with His mighty sovereignty.”</p>
<p>It is hoped that all will attain unto the word of contentment and will speak in praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory. Peace and praise and glory and splendor be upon you and upon those with you and upon those whom neither the assault of the oppressors nor of the pharaohs who have adorned their heads with white and green turbans and have turned people away from the path of God, the Lord of the worlds, could deter.</p>
<p>=== END BH00092 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00093 ===</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart and the one remembered in my heart! The breezes of love wafting from the gardens of your recognition have gladdened me, and the manifestations of affection flowing from the pen of your will in remembrance and praise of God and in love of God and His Cause have stirred me. It is as though your honor has sent with the morning breeze the fragrance of all the gardens. God knows that through it my body was revived, my breast was dilated, and my spirit was gladdened. Therefore, I praised God, the Beloved of the world and the Goal of the nations, for having aided you to serve His Cause, manifest His bounty, and exalt His Word. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you that which befits His generosity, munificence and grace. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whom the horizon of the world was illumined and that which was hidden in the hearts of the nations was revealed! I beseech Thee by the Name through which every face was turned, every tongue spoke, every heedless one attained, every hidden thing was revealed, and every treasured thing emerged, to assist Thy servants and creation to turn unto Thee. O Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones and loved ones have arisen to aid Thy Cause, have entered every land in Thy name, have associated with Thy loved ones in spirit and fragrance, and have shown them the path of Thy good-pleasure and what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. O Lord! Illumine the eyes of Thy servants’ hearts with the lights of their faces, then grant them the sweetness of Thy verses in Thy days. O Lord! This is the Day wherewith Thou didst give glad tidings to all in Thy Tablets, which Thou didst associate with Thyself and make the King of Days through Thy command and power. Yet when it appeared, the servants who disputed Thy verses, denied Thy proof, disbelieved in Thy Self, and cast behind them Thy Book - which, when sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the atmosphere of Thy Purpose, all books, scrolls and scriptures submitted to it - turned away from it.</p>
<p>O Lord! I beseech Thee by the power that hath encompassed all possibilities and the might that hath overcome all created things, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon the people of Thy realm that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, give them to drink of the Kawthar of Thy bestowal, and acquaint them with what hath been sent down in Thy Book and inscribed by the Pen of Thy decree. O Lord! They are the poor and Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous; they are the weak and Thou art the Strong, the Powerful. I beseech Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the Supreme Pen was set in motion and the tongue of knowledge spoke in the kingdom of creation, to ordain for him who hath arisen to mention Thee and serve Thee every good thing Thou hast decreed in Thy Book. Thou seest him, O my God, speaking Thy Name, crying out in Thy Cause, turning unto Thy face, and directing himself toward Thy horizon. Aid him through Thy bounty and favor in that which will attract the hearts of Thy creation. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>I send blessings and salutations and glorification upon the stars in the heaven of Thy knowledge and the Hands of Thy Cause who circled round Thy will, who spoke not except by Thy leave and who clung to none save Thy robe. These are servants whose service, aid, steadfastness, mention and praise have been attested by Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, Thy Scrolls and Thy Tablets. Through them were hoisted the banners of Thy unity in Thy cities and domains, and the standards of Thy sanctity in Thy realm. These are they who preceded Thee not in speech regarding any matter. Their ears were attentive to hearken unto Thy commandments and their eyes were expectant for the lights of Thy countenance. These are honored servants. These are successful servants. These are steadfast servants. Upon them pray the denizens of the Kingdom and the Realm, the people of Paradise and of Supreme Dominion, and beyond them the Tongue of Thy Grandeur. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having aided me to make mention of them and to praise them, and for that which they have achieved in Thy Cause and in Thy days. There is no God but Thee, the All-Numbering, the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>And furthermore, this evanescent one submits that after becoming informed of what was recorded in the august letter, he turned toward the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and presented all of it in the divine presence. This is what the Tongue of the Beloved uttered as He was walking in His Most Glorious, Most Holy and Most Luminous vista. His word, exalted be His grandeur: “We verily glorify from this station thee who hast been gazing toward My horizon, who hast been standing in service to My Cause, and who hast been speaking in praise of Me. We make mention of thine arrival and of that which thou didst attain from the ocean of attainment, and of thy departure after permission, and of thy turning toward various regions for the Cause of God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs. Blessed is the deed that hath won the ornament of acceptance, and the tongue that hath won the praise of God, and the man who hath hastened to the cities and regions to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous.”</p>
<p>This is a Day that cannot be equaled by even an hour of former centuries. This Most Holy, Most Exalted Day hath ever been and shall ever be special, and in the divine Books is attributed unto Him. Every deed that appeareth purely for the sake of God therein is recorded as the lord of deeds before God. Blessed is the soul that ariseth for God’s sake and speaketh for His Face.</p>
<p>O thou who dwellest in the Crimson Ark! Thou shouldst, with the aid of God, glorified be His majesty, be occupied at all times with the service of the Cause of the All-Merciful, that perchance thou mayest enable souls that are far removed to attain the Kawthar of nearness, and quicken lifeless bodies through the outpourings of the ocean of utterance. People have ever been, and continue to be, in need of educators and reminders. Though the people of the Bayan have witnessed with their outward eyes and heard with their outward ears the veils behind which the deluded ones were concealed and to which they clung, yet now these same souls are observed to be even more veiled and further astray. The Water of Life must be offered with the utmost wisdom and utterance, that haply they may become aware and bear witness to the greatness of this Cause. That Essence of being for Whose manifestation they waited throughout ages, cycles and epochs, and Whose presence they beseeched God, exalted be His glory, by night and day - when the Dawn of the divine Day appeared, all were found to be veiled and turned away, save whom thy Lord willed. Would that they had been content with that! Their rancor and hatred reached such a point that they pronounced the death sentence against Him. By the Sun of the horizon of the Cause! The veiled ones among the people of the Bayan are seen to be more wretched, more rebellious and more astray than those souls. Therefore must thou and the assured, convinced and contented souls arise for the sake of God to preserve the weak ones, that perchance they may be protected from the fire of self and passion and turn towards the pavilion of glory and the canopy of grace.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned thy face towards My countenance and set thy course towards Mine horizon! Hearken unto My call. It maketh mention of thee in such wise as cannot be equaled by the treasures of the world or the riches of the nations, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We have made mention of thee time and again from this most exalted Station, when the Servant was standing before the face of his Lord, the Most Glorious. Verily thy Lord hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The Tongue hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance in such wise that the Mother Book hath circled round it, yet most of the people understand not. The lights of Beauty have shone forth from the horizon of grandeur, yet they see not. The Most Great Book moveth before their faces, yet they perceive not. They have followed their own desires and cast behind their backs that which they were commanded by God, the Lord of all being. They have denied the favor and turned away from Him Who came unto them with that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Blessed is he who hath heard My sweetest call and blessed is the one who hath beheld My praiseworthy station. Joy unto him who, though far, hath sought the ocean of My nearness through My leave, and unto the seeker who hath held fast to the cord of My good-pleasure, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Convey, on behalf of the Wronged One, My greetings unto My servants who have quaffed My sealed wine, and give them the glad-tidings of My remembrance, My loving-kindness and My favor which have encompassed both the seen and the unseen. Say: By God! This is the Day of Resurrection. Blessed is he who hath arisen to assist the Cause of his Lord with wisdom and utterance amongst all created things. He is assuredly of the people of Baha in the Preserved Tablet. This is a Day wherein the Spirit calleth out from one direction and Moses from another, while the Beloved standeth before the face of the Beloved One. Say: O peoples of the earth! Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this most exalted station. Fear God and follow not every heedless and veiled one. Say: Behold the Most Sublime Horizon which hath been illumined by the lights of the countenance of your Lord, the Lord of Names. Beware lest the doubts of the wayward hold you back or the intimations of the heedless frighten you. Leave the world behind you, placing your trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Thus hath the Supreme Pen moved and the Kingdom of Names been stirred by the breezes of Revelation as they wafted forth by the command of God, the Almighty, the Most Beloved.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! In truth, if one were to reflect even briefly, in every word of God’s utterances one would behold an ocean of bounty. The veiled, heedless, and corrupt natures perceive not the song of the nightingale and turn not to the rose-garden of divine knowledge. He who has given his heart to croaking knows not the value of the choice wine, and he who has drunk from and grown accustomed to the brackish, bitter pool will not turn to the water of life - he has been and will forever be deprived thereof, unless the hand of grace should seize him and through the blessing of the breath of pure and assured souls he find his way to God’s straight path. This evanescent servant beseeches and implores the True One, exalted be His glory and abundant be His favors, to burn away and obliterate the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings of the heedless ones through the heat of the sun of certitude, that all may attain to the ocean of oneness and gather beneath the shade of the all-embracing Word. A hundred thousand regrets, a hundred thousand regrets that these days are passing and none has recognized their worth and station save whom God, the All-Knowing, the All-Numbering, has willed. God willing, through your efforts and those of perfect souls, the heedless may drink from the ocean of awareness and the ones who have turned away may become illumined by the lights of the sun of acceptance. Every difficult matter that servants find most challenging has been and will be easy and simple before Him. The servant asks his Lord to open, by the hand of power, a door before the faces of the servants that they may enter therein through His leave, His name, His remembrance and His grace. Glory be upon you and upon those with you who follow the Cause of your Lord Who has appeared in truth with a sovereignty that has conquered all who are in the heavens and the earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>As for the question concerning the harmony and fellowship of Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory and might of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the tongue of our Lord, the All-Merciful, uttered in response: This matter is acceptable and beloved. The station of love, fellowship, agreement and unity, after recognition of God and steadfastness in His Cause, takes precedence over most good deeds. This is what God has testified to in the Books and Tablets. This is what the Desired One has acknowledged morning and evening. God willing, may they act in accordance with what has been revealed in the Most Holy Book - that is, with the consent of both parties and your consent. For you are now considered in the place of a father. Would that this servant were present in that gathering and could mention that which gladdens hearts from the words of the Beloved, and could share in the joy and delight with those assembled. O beloved of my heart! Your letter was presented twice at the Most Holy Court. Indeed, supreme contentment was observed from the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court regarding the degrees of your sincerity and devotion, and your arising to serve the Cause of God and spread His signs. Blessed art thou for having attained unto His grace and good-pleasure. And His utterances concluded with these mighty and blessed words, exalted be His utterance: God willing, may all that he possesses of limbs and members, certitude and assurance, acceptance and spirit, existence and breaths be spent in the path of divine service. We are with him and his helper.[…]</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about the Land of Kha and those regions, and their acceptance, steadfastness, assurance and devotion - these matters were presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Threshold. His Word, exalted be His grandeur: “This is of God’s grace unto them. O thou who speakest My praise! All must be thankful to the Truth, the Most High, for having enabled them to attain this most exalted station. By the life of God! This is such an exaltation that all exaltation boweth down before it. We acknowledge their acceptance, their devotion, their mention, their utterance, their love, their affection and their steadfastness. We desire to behold them rise to heights beyond their present station. God willing, may they manifest such steadfastness that should all the peoples of the world - that is, the learned, the wise and the mystics, together with the books of the first and the last - attempt to prevent them from partaking of the Salsabil of the All-Merciful and the choice-sealed wine, they would find themselves powerless and would regard them all as a mere handful of dust.”</p>
<p>Praise be to God! You and Asad - upon him be My glory and My mercy - have exerted your utmost in service and teaching. The fruits thereof will assuredly become manifest. The seed of knowledge, when sown in pure soil, will certainly sprout and flourish verdantly in the world. Henceforth also, they must in all conditions occupy themselves with this Most Great, Most Great Cause and this Most Great, Most Great Station. From this station We send Our greetings to the faces of the people of Kha who have forsaken the world and turned to the Most Great Name, whereby the horizons of the hearts of those near unto God and the sincere ones were illumined. We give them glad tidings and make mention of them on this Day, one hour of which cannot be equated with ages and centuries. The Supreme Pen hath previously testified on their behalf in such wise that the fragrance of their Lord’s loving-kindness, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, hath been diffused. Ask God at all times to grant them success and to confirm them in teaching this irrevocable Cause. That which would gladden hearts and souls hath been revealed for them aforetime and in these days.</p>
<p>God willing, may they be illumined at all times by the lights of the morn of God’s Day, arise to serve His Cause, speak in His Name, drink in His love, and be engaged in His remembrance. Praise be to God! They have attained unto that which most of the divines, mystics and rulers are today deprived of. Thus hath the Tongue of Utterance spoken in the Kingdom of Knowledge. Blessed is he who hath heard and woe unto the heedless. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about your intention to consult about proceeding, if agreeable, with the beloved Mr.&nbsp;Mirza, upon him be the Glory of God and His Light, to the land of Kha - this matter was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. His word, exalted be His grandeur, states: “Previously it was revealed from the Supreme Pen that they should proceed to the regions of the land of Ta. However, at present whatever becomes manifest from the consultation you have intended is acceptable. In all conditions, you must hold fast to that which causes the promotion of God’s Cause and the exaltation of His Word. Those souls who are today occupied with ornaments and are proud of outward glory, even if they should turn, their acceptance would be limited. But after holding fast to teaching and the manifestation of the Cause and the exaltation of the Word, thou shalt see them turning, accepting, submissive and humble before the remembrance of God and His Cause. Thus hath it been in all ages. This is why it was previously mentioned that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. Glory and wealth are two great obstacles for heedless souls. But ere long they shall be seen as more perishing than Abu-Lahab. The dead are not worthy of being heard, nor will they ever be, although at present some from various regions among these souls claim to have turned and accepted, yet verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The acceptance of such souls is in all cases limited. Ask ye God to assist all to that which He loves and is pleased with.” End quote.</p>
<p>In truth, the matter of teaching is a great matter. That beloved one and other gentlemen must be mindful of it and in all directions occupied souls who are at rest should, with perfect joy and fragrance and revealed wisdom, engage in teaching God’s Cause.</p>
<p>And further, mention was made of the beloved of the soul, Mr.&nbsp;Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, he is favored by God’s grace. Some time ago his letter arrived requesting Tablets, which were revealed and sent in those same days. Later another letter arrived from the direction of Hadba specifically for the land of K and its surroundings, requesting wondrous and exalted Tablets. However, nearly a year had passed from its date, therefore there was delay in sending those Tablets. In these days it was again presented before the Most Holy Presence. Several Tablets were revealed specifically for Q.M.S. It is hoped that the rest will also be revealed. The purpose is that the delay in the Tablets was due to the delay in the arrival of his letter. On behalf of this evanescent one, convey exalted greetings to him. Mention of him has been made in the Most Holy Presence and, God willing, will always continue to be made.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about sending names on a separate sheet - it was not in your envelope.</p>
<p>Know ye concerning the direction of prayer towards the Most Holy and Exalted Spot, what ye wrote hath been submitted. This word was heard from the Sacred Tongue, speaking the truth. His Holiness Assad, upon him be Baha, also hath permission. These two are confirmed and adorned with acceptance. Yet praise be to God that they turned towards the Sacred Court, traversed land and sea, and endured hardships in the path of God. Praise be to God, they ultimately reached their supreme goal and attained the station of meeting and reunion that is mentioned in all divine books. Happy are they, blessed are they! Now, since the teaching of the Cause is the most important of all matters, We have therefore commanded this. By the life of God, the greatness of this Cause is such that every great thing testifies to its greatness. God willing, may they be successful therein and illuminate all horizons with the light of His countenance and kindle them with the fire of divine love. We have not forbidden it now, but since this matter had occurred, We commanded another matter which is most important today. Upon them be My Baha, My grace, My mercy and My loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about his honor M.S., this servant is aware of several instances where the True One, exalted be His glory, protected him and delivered him from great dangers. However, his many occupations have at times preoccupied him. God willing, relief shall come. Once this evanescent servant heard these words from the Sacred Tongue: “O servant in attendance! Divine grace hath several times delivered his honor M.S. from great dangers. However, due to excessive attention to worldly matters, when a divine tablet was sent to him, he did not succeed in reciting what was revealed therein and reflecting upon it, that he might discover its purpose and hold fast to that which is everlasting and enduring.” After hearing this, this servant prayed for him that he might be assisted in that which is pleasing to God, and God willing, I hope that what was submitted may be answered. In this last instance when they summoned him to the land of T., as commanded this servant wrote and sent the well-known blessed circle for his protection. This evanescent servant beseeches the Truth in all conditions to protect him and assist him in that which is befitting.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for him who was named Muhammad-Husayn and who ascended unto God, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Forgiving, the Generous!</p>
<p>We make mention of him who made mention of Him Who turned to My Self, circled round Me, soared in My atmosphere, spread My traces, and spoke My praise when he desired to help Me, and I am the All-Knowing Witness. O Muhammad-Husayn! Thou art in the Supreme Companion, and the Lord of Names maketh mention of thee in this Great Prison. God forgave thee at the first moment when the Countenance of the Ancient One turned toward thee, and there was revealed from the Pen that which caused the ocean of forgiveness to surge and the fragrance of the Merciful’s loving-kindness to waft, and I am the Forgiving, the Merciful. By the life of God! Thou hast attained unto that whose fragrance shall never be cut off from the world. Thus doth the Lord of Eternity bear witness, and I am the Informed, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which thou hast attained on this Day whereon the Point of the Bayan crieth out before the face of the Merciful: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And this is what God revealed for him who was named Haji Muhammad, exalted be His utterance and His grandeur […]</p>
<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hearken unto that which the Wronged One calleth out to thee on this Day which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the ancient Scriptures and mentioned in the hearts of the Messengers. Be thou of such steadfastness that neither the veils of the enemies nor the doubts of the perverse shall hinder thee. Verily We have sent down the Bayan wherein We gave glad tidings unto all of this Revelation which hath appeared and made manifest His straight Path. Say: This is the Day of God, were ye of them that know. All the books of the world have testified unto it, were ye of them that hear. Say: This is the Day wherein the Mother Book hath appeared and hath testified that there is none other God but I, the Ancient Revealer. He needeth not any thing to prove His Cause, neither any mention from among mentions, nor any name from among names, nor any book from among the former books. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken as He walked in this manifest Prison. This is a Day wherein none hath attained save those who have cast the world behind their backs and taken that which they were commanded by God, the Lord of all worlds. Rejoice thou in this Tablet through which the fragrance of My garment hath been wafted, and the breaths of My utterance have been diffused, and every tongue hath proclaimed that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Beauteous. Take thou the Book with strength from Us, then read it among myriads of them that are nigh. We counsel thee and Our loved ones to be steadfast in this Cause whereby every foot hath slipped save such as God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day, hath willed. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the grace and mercy of God and have acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged in this glorious Tablet.</p>
<p>In these days a letter arrived from Aqa Mirza Kazim and Aqa Khudadad, upon them be the glory of God, and likewise from Aqa Mulla ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God, wherein mention was made of Aqa ’Azizu’llah and other friends, upon them be the glory of God. Praise be to God, all were mentioned before the Divine Throne and attained unto infinite grace. That beloved one had also made mention of Aqa Is?aq and Aqa Rajab, upon them be the glory of God. Concerning all of them this blessed word hath issued forth from the Source of the Cause - exalted be His grandeur: Verily We have heard their call and have answered them with truth, and We have beheld their turning and have turned unto them from this most exalted Station that they might rejoice in the grace of their Lord, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. We send Our greetings upon their faces from this forbidden Station, and We give them glad tidings of God’s grace and mercy, and We remind them of the supreme steadfastness, and We bid them to that whereby the Cause of God, the Mighty, the Loving, may be exalted. If all the friends of God were to attain unto a single word from Him, verily it would suffice them all, for nothing that appeareth or is hidden in the earth can equal it. He Who possesseth knowledge of all things in a Book that was sealed with the seal of God and hidden from the eyes of all who are in the heavens and the earth beareth witness unto this. Thou shalt give them glad tidings from the Wronged One, then impart unto them that which God hath imparted unto thee in this sealed and preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>This servant had not the opportunity this time to present their answers. God willing, they shall be sent later. Ye had made mention of Muhammad Rida Khan and Sulayman Khan, upon them be the glory of God. It was presented at the Most Holy Court. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! Today, whosoever hath been mentioned with the word ‘contentment’ from the Dawning-Place of Revelation, the Lord of Names, hath attained unto the boundless effusions of God. Blessed is he who hath drunk from the ocean of contentment and hath arisen with perfect steadfastness to promote the Cause of the Lord of all beings. This is the Day of goodly deeds, goodly words, and praiseworthy conduct. Blessed is the soul through which the Cause of its Lord, the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth, hath been aided. Every good deed performed today is and shall be the cause of everlasting remembrance. Exalted is this glorious station! God willing, may you at all times fix your gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon and be set ablaze with the fire of God’s love. All things lie within the grasp of extinction save that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen - this shall endure and remain forever. Rejoice thou in the remembrance of thy Lord and render thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds. He hath remembered thee as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. The glory rest upon thee, upon thy son, and upon those who have attained unto this Cause which hath caused the limbs of every heedless one to quake.</p>
<p>This is what hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Creator of the heavens, unto him who was named Ghulam-Qabli-Rida:</p>
<p>He is the All-Speaking, the All-Seeing!</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Qabli-Rida! Rejoice that the Wronged One remembereth thee from the direction of the Most Great Scene, the Spot which God hath made the circling-point of them that are nigh unto Him. Be thou ablaze with the fire of My love, soaring in My atmosphere, and speaking with wisdom and utterance in praise of My beautiful Name. Take thou the choice wine of utterance in the name of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, then drink thereof with His wondrous remembrance. Erelong shall clamor be raised in most lands. This is what He Who broke the Seal hath informed you of through His luminous and choice wine. By God’s life! Wert thou to taste the sweetness of utterance, such joy would seize thee that neither the doubts of the divines nor the allusions of the heedless would grieve thee. Thus hath crowed the Cock of the Throne, while the Wronged One was in this noble station. The Most Exalted Pen counseleth all to show forth the utmost steadfastness, that they may be observed to be so firm and steadfast in the Cause that the cawing of them that are on earth shall not deprive them of the divine Kingdom. The deniers among the people of the Bayan are seen to be more veiled than the peoples of former times. They have perceived naught of the Day of God save its name, and are heedless and unaware of that which God hath purposed. Convey thou My greetings to the friends in that land on behalf of the True One and make them aware. We, verily, send Our greetings unto them from this Spot and give them the glad-tidings of God’s grace and mercy, and We bid them observe the wisdom which We have sent down in the Sacred Scriptures and Tablets. The glory rest upon thee and upon them from God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>And likewise thou didst make mention of the servants, that is, the Siyyids of the lands of S and Sh, and the friends of those regions - upon them be the glory of God. This was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken:</p>
<p>In the Name of the All-Knowing Speaker […]</p>
<p>The Wronged One’s Pen and Tongue have not paused for a moment in promulgating the Divine Cause except as ordained. I swear by the Sun of Revelation that hath risen above the horizon of the prison that, at a time when sorrows had encompassed Us from all directions and trials and tribulations were pouring down like torrential rain, We summoned the peoples of the earth to the Most Exalted Horizon with all Our power and might. God willing, may the noble ones of that land arise to aid the Cause with such arising that neither weariness shall overtake it nor shall sitting still comprehend it. Today, every goodly deed that is manifested for God’s sake - its influence and remembrance shall endure as long as God’s names endure. They must occupy themselves with the utmost determination in teaching God’s Cause, exalted be His glory. Today is the day of this blessed verse which sayeth: “Lead forth the people from darkness into light and give them glad tidings of the days of God.” We beseech God to assist them in protecting the weak souls, that each may be observed more steadfast than that which is steadfast and more firmly rooted than mountains. The Cause is exceedingly mighty and the people are weak. They must, through the power of faith, assist the people of that land to recognize the Cause of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance. Verily their Lord, the Self-Subsisting, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>The barking ones are present in every land, and this matter hath been revealed aforetime in the divine scriptures and tablets. Assuredly, whatsoever hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen shall come to pass. One must educate souls through the Most Great Word in such wise that diverse winds shall not remove them from the shore of the sea of oneness, and they shall be observed so steadfast that the power and might of the world shall appear as non-existent and null. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to all the friends of that land and give them glad tidings of God’s grace, loving-kindness and mercy, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, all are mentioned in the Most Great Prison and are present before His face. The Glory be upon them and upon those who have cast aside the world on this Most Great Day and have taken up that which they were commanded by the Powerful, the Ancient.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about one of the handmaidens of God who used opium for pain and who, after the prohibition was declared, abandoned it and nearly perished - the divine decree is that the patient must follow the physician’s directions, but the physician must be skilled. In such case, whatever is prescribed must be followed, for the preservation of human life is, in God’s sight, greater than any other matter. God, exalted be His glory, hath given precedence to the science of medicine, for in the existence and health of the body lies the obligation to carry out His laws. Thus health was and shall remain of primary importance.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the honored wife, upon her be the Glory of God, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. He said: “God willing, may she attain to that which God loveth and is pleased with, and may she be gladdened through the favor of the Beloved. We, from this spot, send Our greetings to her and make mention of her as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Hearer, the Answerer.” God willing, hereafter the Most Holy, Most Great Tablet specifically for that honored lady shall be sent.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention at the close of your letter of the name of Ismu’llah al-A?daq - upon him be all the most glorious glory and the most exalted exaltation - it was presented before the Throne. His word, exalted be His might and His grandeur: “We verily seal the end of the letter of Our servant in attendance with the mention of him who was named ‘The Most Truthful’ in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who turned to the Lord of Names in such wise that a company of the Concourse on High turned with him. His Lord, the All-Merciful, is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Through his turning, faces were turned, and through his arising, the servants arose before the countenance of their Lord, the All-Subduing, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The wine of recognition so intoxicated him that he soared unto the All-Merciful until he stood before the face of his Lord, the Almighty, the Omnipotent. We testify that he attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God and bore witness to that which God did testify: that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the Ancient. The lights of the Throne so seized him that his sighs of longing ascended and his tears fell like spring rain. We have mentioned him time and again in the Tablet of him who was named Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin in the Book of God, the Exalted, the Great. Likewise have We mentioned him in diverse Tablets in such wise that all the treasures of earth and heaven cannot equal it. To this testifies He Who speaks in all things: ‘There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.’ Blessed is the soul that drew nigh unto him and visited him, as spoken by the Tongue of Grandeur concerning his noble station. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those related to him, whether female or male, whether young or old.”</p>
<p>“O thou who speakest My praise and standeth in My service! Give glad tidings from Me to his family. Say: By God’s life! You stand before the face of your Lord, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. Beware lest the affairs of creation sadden you. Leave the world to its people and cling to the hem of your Lord’s mercy, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.” End.</p>
<p>Furthermore, convey to all the friends in that land the expression of this servant’s sincerity, devotion and nothingness, which depends on the favors of that Beloved One. God willing, may all attain to the water of steadfastness in such wise that its effects become manifest. To the true beloved one, he who was named at the Most Great Scene as ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar - upon him be God’s care, might and favors - I express my evanescence and nothingness. Likewise to the other gentlemen who are all in my thoughts: Haji Muhajir, Aqa ’Abdu’r-Rahim and his brother - upon them both be the glory of the All-Merciful. God willing, they have arrived by now; to them also I express my greetings. Glory be upon you and upon those who have sacrificed their spirits, their bodies and all they possess in service to the Cause of God - our Beloved, their Beloved, our Goal, their Goal, and the Goal of all in the heavens and the earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>29 Ramadan 1298</p>
<p>One more submission: In these days, if someone were to turn towards the lands of ?ad, namely Najaf and Ard and other territories, it would be most beloved. However, it must be an enlightened person whose heart is connected to God’s grace. In such case, whatever he mentions will prove effective. The same applies to other lands, whether cities or villages.</p>
<p>=== END BH00093 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00094 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath subdued all who are in creation through the strains of His Most Exalted Pen, whereby the trumpet was sounded and all who are in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, save whom God, the Lord of Names, did will. He is the One through Whom the hidden secret was revealed, and the mystic symbol unveiled, and the concealed Name made manifest, whereby the great terror appeared amongst mankind and a hidden Cause emerged swifter than the twinkling of an eye. Blessed is he who hath cast away what the people possess and taken what he was bidden by the Ordainer of Destiny, through Whom the Greatest Scene was adorned and supreme joy was manifested among the nations. I pray and send salutations upon those who have attained unto the most great steadfastness in this Cause, whereby the hearts of the possessors of understanding were perturbed. These are servants whom vain desires have not kept back from the Lord of Names. They have arisen in such wise as to astound all hearts and minds.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name all necks have bowed throughout the horizons! I beseech Thee by the imprint of Thy feet in Thy domains, and by the fragrance of Thy raiment in Thy lands, and by the sweetness of Thy utterance amongst Thy creation, to aid Thy loved ones to champion Thy Cause and to protect them from the evil of Thine enemies. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom the powers of the world cannot frustrate, nor can the influences of the nations weaken. Thou hast ever been powerful through Thy might and sovereign through Thy will. Thou doest what Thou pleasest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Thou art the Generous Bestower.</p>
<p>And then, the servant heard the sound of the wings of the bird of Thy utterance upon the branches of the tree of Thy words, and it was warbling in praise of God, my Beloved and thy Beloved, my Purpose and thy Purpose, and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and the earth. When I heard and found and knew, I was present and submitted at a station wherein my mention and my allusion were cut off. The Point of the Bayan had testified to this before in His exalted words when He wrote this essence in His remembrance: “He cannot be indicated by My indication, nor by what was revealed in the Bayan. How can He Who was sanctified beyond the indication of the Point and what was sent down in the Bayan be described by My description, or be characterized by My attributes, or be known by My utterances which speak of the limitations of My being and My station?”</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and my Purpose and the Ultimate End of my desire! I beseech Thee by Thy Preserved Tablet and Thy Hidden Knowledge to forgive me and have mercy upon me and remit my transgressions. O Lord! I am the sinner and Thou art the Forgiving One; I am the transgressor and Thou art the Kind, the Generous.</p>
<p>When what was in your letter was presented, the Countenance of the Ancient Beauty turned toward me and spoke that which caused the fragrance of utterance to waft throughout the world. He said, exalted be His grandeur: O Varqa! Rejoice in that We have caused thee to hear the rustling of the Lote-Tree of knowledge, the flowing of the waters of utterance, the scratching of the Pen of the All-Merciful, and the warbling of the Bird of inner meanings from this sacred, pure, subtle, gentle, mighty and impregnable atmosphere. We have mentioned thee before, and before that before, and We mention thee at this time. Then those whose names thou didst mention - thy Lord is verily the Answerer, the Counter, the All-Knowing. We have observed, and We are the All-Seeing. We have known, and We are the All-Informed. We have detailed the remembrance for thee, and We are the All-Bountiful. We have set forth the verses, and We are the All-Powerful. We have manifested the evidences, and We are the Strong, the Trustworthy. The roaring of men cannot frustrate Us, nor the mewing of cats. Verily thy Lord calleth and speaketh and saith, though the wolf howleth and attacketh with manifest tyranny. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who have cast aside all else save Me, who have arisen to serve My Cause and have spoken My praise. These are servants upon whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise pray, and behind them is the Tongue of Grandeur in this noble station. By the life of God! That which hath been ordained for them is such that pens are powerless to describe it. To this testifieth the Preserved Tablet which is with Him. Blessed is the house wherein My remembrance is raised and which is honored by My loved ones who have turned to the ocean of My knowledge and the heaven of My mercy and the sun of My loving-kindness that hath preceded all worlds.</p>
<p>You had written that you were gathered in the house of Haji Aqa Muhammad and Aqa Mirza ’Ali-Naqi with a group of the friends of God, and Haji Aqa Muhammad requested that a petition be submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Threshold on behalf of those present at the gathering. This detail was presented at the Holy Threshold, and that beloved one’s supplication was also presented before His face. This is what the Desired One spoke in reply. He said, exalted be His grandeur: O Varqa! We have heard thy call time after time, and We have known that wherewith thou didst supplicate God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, and We have answered thee again and again, and We mention those whose names were in thy letter as a bounty from Us. Verily He loveth to remember him who remembereth Him, and desireth him who desireth Him. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remind My loved ones on My behalf and glorify their faces with My Name, the Gladdening, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Today all must be adorned with the ornament of steadfastness, for the devils lie in wait and have been lying in wait, and the croaking hath been raised and shall be raised. Before this these tidings were revealed and sent down from the Pen of the All-Choosing. Well is it with them that understand. Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Hearken unto the call of God. Verily He calleth you and counseleth you to observe the most great steadfastness and that whereby His firm and mighty Cause may be uplifted. Should anyone bring you the book of Hell or the leaves of Zaqqum, cast them behind you, remaining steadfast in this Cause whereby the hearts of the learned were disturbed and the feet of all on earth have slipped save those whom God hath willed, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of the master of the house wherein was raised the remembrance of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. O Muhammad! The Countenance of the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from this Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein was established the throne of the Lord of Names, and He mentioneth thee with that which attracteth minds. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee and say […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, and glory be unto Thee, O Creator of Heaven, for having remembered me in the Most Great Prison and revealed unto me that which was hidden from the nations. I bear witness that Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>We make mention of Nabil who traversed the lands and journeyed through countries for My Name and chose exile for love of Me. He was named Muhammad in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Loving. I testify that he cast away all that the people possessed and took what was commanded by God, the Lord of existence. He endured in the path of God what no one on earth hath known. Thus doth the Wronged One remember him that it may be a treasure for him throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee for thy patience. We beseech God to assist thee in a manner befitting this Day which hath been adorned by its mention in the Torah, the Gospel and the Psalms.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-A’zam! Hearken unto the Call from beyond the sea of grandeur: “Verily there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower.” This is a day wherein the Throne was established upon the water and the heaven of knowledge was adorned with the luminary of My Name, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Blessed is the strong one who hath held fast to the cord of the grace of his Lord, and the speaker who hath uttered the praise of God, the Lord of all mankind. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken: Rejoice and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Revealer of the verses, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of earth and heaven.” Glory from Us be upon those whom the hosts could not frighten and whom the veils could not hinder.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabl-i-Naqi! We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee with this mighty remembrance. Verily, He Who remembereth thee was named Jehovah in the Torah, the Spirit of Truth in the Gospel, and the Great News in the Qur’an. By My life! He desired from the Books naught but My Book, and from the Bayan naught but My manifestation and My wise remembrance. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of God in His days, and blessed is he who hath clung to His luminous hem. Doth anyone hear the verses of his Lord, and is there any soul who findeth the sweetness in the utterance of his Lord, the Speaker, the All-Seeing? Thus have We adorned the sea of knowledge with the ark of utterance and the heaven of certitude with the luminary of My mighty Name.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Yusuf! The Most Exalted Pen hath turned unto thee from this Most Holy, Most Great, Most Mighty, Most Sublime Station. Thou hast attained that which none would attain even were they to expend all the treasures of the earth in the path of God, the King, the Most High, the Most Great. Preserve thou the pearls of knowledge in the vessels of thy heart through My Name, the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed art thou for having turned and advanced and heard the Call of God, the Lord of the worlds. Be thou steadfast in the love of thy Lord in such wise that the allusions of the opposers shall not cause thee to slip.</p>
<p>O youth! Remember when thou wert present before the Throne and didst hear that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in His glorious station. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee and enabled thee to recognize this Cause whereby all things proclaimed: “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.” Blessed is the soul that hath cast away what it possessed and was moved by the Will of God, the Lord of Kings. We summon all unto the Most Sublime Horizon and counsel them to observe that which hath been revealed in My Preserved Tablet. Glory be upon thee and upon thy father and upon those who have drunk from the Most Great Sea through My Name, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Hearken unto My call which hath been raised from My prison abode that the call may attract thee unto a station wherein the conditions of the world shall not sadden thee nor shall the veils of the heedless shut thee out. Blessed art thou and thy father. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified to his recognition and submission when most of the servants turned away from the Countenance. Thus have We remembered thee as a bounty from Us that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-’Askar! Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God did Himself bear witness ere the creation of all things: that there is none other God but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. By God’s life! Soon shall the world and whatsoever it containeth of kings and subjects, of rich and poor, pass away, and there shall endure for thee that which hath been revealed by My Most Exalted Pen in this glorious station. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then render thanks unto thy Lord for having sent down unto thee that which cheereth the hearts of them that are nigh unto Him. Hold thou fast unto the cord of grace and cleave unto the hem of thy Lord’s mercy, and say: I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of the world and Manifestation of the Most Great Name, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones, whom the vanities of the world have not kept back from turning towards Thy horizon. O my Lord! Thou art the All-Bountiful, and I stand before the door of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee not to deny me that which is with Thee. Verily, Thou art God, the Lord of the mighty throne.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of him who hath been named Yusuf, who turned his face toward Mine own and believed in My signs, and attained unto My recognition when most of My creatures turned away from Me. Thus doth God remember him who seeketh Him on a day wherein every proud and stubborn one hath turned aside from Him. Thy name hath been mentioned; therefore have We remembered thee in this Tablet, than which nothing on earth can compare, as thy Lord, the All-Informed, doth testify. Let not the gestures of the people grieve you, nor the denial of those who have turned away from My straight path. God shall soon seize them with His justice, and shall exalt the names of those who have believed in Him when He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>We counsel you to manifest supreme steadfastness and to observe that which God hath revealed in His mighty Book. Soon shall the earth and all that are upon it be rolled up, and sovereignty shall remain with God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O thou bird that soareth in Mine atmosphere! Convey the verses of thy Lord. Verily they draw them nigh unto the One, the All-Informed, and strengthen them in that whereunto they were called, and give them to drink from the Kawthar of utterance in My wondrous Name. Thus have the rains descended and the seas surged by the command of thy Lord, the Almighty.</p>
<p>We make mention of Our servants and Our loved ones whose names were not mentioned in thy letter, and We give them glad tidings of God’s grace and mercy, and We send Our greetings upon their faces from this mighty Prison. Ask thou God to assist them and strengthen them in that which He loveth and which pleaseth Him, and to make them among those who are firmly established. And We remember My handmaidens who have believed in God and His signs, and who have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hands of His bounty. Verily thy Lord is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that the loved ones of God in that land have attained unto the wondrous and exalted divine verses. Let them know the value of this supreme bounty. Were the veil to be lifted and the station revealed, all would fall prostrate and everyone on earth would enter beneath the shade of a single word. O beloved of my heart! Most of the people of the earth are heedless and unaware, and even those souls who have attained some measure of recognition and have drunk from the ocean of knowledge have not arisen as befits the Day of God, save whom God, thy Lord, willeth. Consider the people of the Bayan - though they count themselves among the most exalted of creation, they are seen to be several degrees lower than other religions. Some have made arguments about “Him Whom God shall make manifest” yet remained deprived of His presence. They have clung to the Bayan while being barred from the One Who revealed it, even though the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath said in the fifteenth chapter of the third Vahid, these exalted words: “None knoweth the time of the Revelation except God. Whenever it appears, all must acknowledge the Point of Truth and render thanks unto God.” He also said: “The whole of the Bayan is only like a ring upon His blessed finger”, and in another place He said: “The entire Bayan is but a leaf amongst the leaves of His Paradise.” Nevertheless these ignorant people have contented themselves with mere fancy and remained veiled from the Dawning-Place of certitude. The humility, submissiveness, and self-effacement of the Point of the Bayan is clear and evident throughout the Bayan. He saith that He is sanctified from being known through any recognition of His own or through what is revealed in the Bayan. Reflect upon these blessed words which have issued from the Dawning-Place of the Bayan, the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all beings be sacrificed for His sake. This is the same word which this evanescent one mentioned at the beginning of this discourse, and this blessed word is the essence of the entire Bayan, as attested by the Point Himself. His exalted words are: “I have written the essence concerning His remembrance: He shall not be known through My allusions, nor through what hath been revealed in the Bayan. Nay, by His glory, this word is greater in God’s estimation than the worship of all who are on earth, for the essence of all worship leadeth to this. Therefore, as thou hast recognized God, recognize Him Whom God shall make manifest, for He is too glorious and exalted to be known through any but Himself or to be described by the allusions of His creatures. Verily, I am the first to believe in Him and in His signs, and I have taken from the virgin gardens of the paradise of His knowledge the gardens of His words. Yea, by His glory, He is the Truth, there is no God but Him, all are upheld by His command.” He further saith, exalted be His words: “Know thou that on that Day none shall be recognized save God, none shall be worshipped but Him, none shall be described except Him, none shall be loved but Him, and none shall be sought except Him.” This blessed passage correspondeth with what was revealed in previous Books concerning this most great Revelation. Nevertheless, these confused masses who attribute themselves to the Bayan have sought to extinguish the divine Light with the foul winds of their falsehoods. Fie upon them and their loyalty! Glory be to God! These heedless people argue based on vain imaginings of the past and through a hundred thousand schemes […]</p>
<p>And they have resorted to a hundred thousand artifices and deceptions that perchance they might prevent a soul from the straight path. Would that they were truthful in what they claim! Among them is Mirza Ahmad-i-Kirmani. Several petitions from him reached the Most Holy Court, and later when he began speaking nonsense, as it was not accepted, he arose in opposition. After some time, multiple petitions filled with repentance and contrition arrived from him, and some also interceded. Nevertheless, in these days he has again arisen in hypocrisy and joined the source of clamor. He was in the great city, and according to reports, due to his reprehensible deeds and contradictory statements, he was expelled from that place as well. In any case, since such as he and his like are found, therefore these words were mentioned so that you may inform the friends that perchance they may attain unto the wine of steadfastness and not be deprived by the likes of such vain souls. Verily, He guideth whom He willeth unto His straight path. In the Kitab-i-Aqdas this blessed verse was revealed, His words, exalted be His grandeur: “O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, behold thee in a state which God doth not approve. We perceive that which none perceiveth save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And we discover that which passeth in thy innermost heart. With Us is the knowledge of all things recorded in a lucid Tablet.” This blessed verse in the Kitab-i-Aqdas was revealed at a time when even the name of Ahmad was not outwardly mentioned. The servant beseecheth his Lord to protect His weak servants from these ones. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. This remote soul is seen to be very changeable, at times repentant and remorseful, and he says what must be said. I submit to the honored Nabil, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, that while time remains, and opportunity remains, and form remains, and tongue remains, God willing, you should say that which guides and leads to the Everlasting. The exalted letter which was addressed to this evanescent servant came as the bestower of meaning to the temples of words and the joy-giver to the world of sorrows, and after it was read it was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in reply, His words, exalted be His grandeur: They speak truly in what they have mentioned, for if reports of their movements had not come repeatedly, surely that which is suspended in the Kingdom of Divine Will would have been revealed in their name. God willing, may they be confirmed in all conditions to the remembrance and praise of Truth and may they speak that which is befitting and worthy of this victorious Day. The Glory be upon him from the presence of the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Another matter is to announce that another letter from that beloved one arrived, and you had written that in the house of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza ’A.B.N. upon him be 96 69 [Baha’u’llah], a group of divine friends were present in that gathering and were speaking in praise of the Most Great Countenance. These matters were presented to the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Threshold, and these exalted words descended from the heaven of will - exalted be His grandeur: “God testifies that there is no God but Him, and He Who sits upon the throne of imprisonment, He is indeed the One to Whom the books of the world have testified and toward Whose direction the Messengers of nations have turned, and He is indeed the One through Whom every hidden mystery and every wise command has been made manifest. He makes mention of the ’Ayn and the Ba, and gives him glad tidings of God’s grace and mercy that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. We have remembered him and make mention of his house wherein the remembrance of God, the Exalted, the Great, was raised. O Varqa! That which shall endure for him throughout the duration of God’s earthly and heavenly kingdoms is the expression of favor that has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen concerning him and has been recorded in the Crimson Book. God willing, may he be enabled to preserve it. The disturbing conditions of the world have darkened it and prevented its freshness, purity and delicacy. God willing, may they attain to His grace and hold fast to the cord of steadfastness. Give him My glad tidings and remind him of that which befitteth the days of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The Glory be upon him and his family from the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of him who is named with Alif and Ha, who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He is among those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and responded to their Lord when the Call was raised from His noble station. We have adorned his head with the crown of faith and his heart with the ornament of recognition. Verily his Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Mighty, the Compassionate. We counsel thee to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the people have slipped who cast the Covenant of God behind their backs and followed what they were commanded by every foolish learned one. Act according to what We have commanded thee in the Book and say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast caused me to know the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Treasury of Thy mysteries. I beseech Thee to enable me to do that which befitteth Thy mighty and wondrous Day.’</p>
<p>We counsel thee and those who have believed to fear God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thy letter hath come before the Face wherein was mention of My loved ones. We have remembered thee and them as a grace from Us and have sent it to thee by the hand of him who is named Muhammad-Qabli-‘Ali. When thou hast attained and visited, say: ’Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Wronged One, the Stranger.’ Verily the Glorious One mentioneth His servant, the Friend, who hath heard and responded to his Ancient Lord. Thou art he who hath turned to the Most Great Ocean after the turning away of the peoples and hast drunk My sealed wine in My Name, the Strong, the Trustworthy. Say: O loved ones of the All-Merciful in all lands! By the True One! The wine is My love and My words do pour it forth. Blessed is he who hath drawn nigh and drunk thereof through My beautiful remembrance. O Friend! Rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance. All the treasures of the world cannot equal it, to this doth the Lord of Eternity bear witness in this mighty station. This is a station wherein every Prophet hath rejoiced, every Messenger circled round, every Intended One aimed at, and every trusted Spirit descended. Blessed is the ear that hath heard My call and the soul that hath arisen to serve the Cause of its Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>And in another place, you had mentioned that in the residence of Aqa Mirza Ghulam-’Ali, son of Jenab-i-Dhabi?, and Aqa Yusuf, upon them be the glory of God, a number of the friends of God were present and were engaged in the mention of the Friend. This detail was also presented before His presence. Mention was made of Jenab-i-Aqa Mirza Ghulam-’Ali and Jenab-i-Aqa Yusuf and certain others among the assured souls gathered in the house of Jenab-i-Haji Aqa Muhammad, upon him and them be the glory of God, and especially for the rest, in this station, from the Kingdom of Will was revealed: Should a soul observe the bounty and loving-kindness and mercy of God, he would in truth be bewildered. O My beloved and My love! After noon, which is the time of rest for the Ancient Beauty, may His glory be exalted, this servant presented anew, one by one, as commanded, thy letters, and the answer was revealed from the Kingdom of grace, and in relation to each of the names mentioned in thy letter, the Sun of bounty did shine forth and became manifest - may the world’s spirit be a sacrifice for His bounty. In truth one becomes bewildered. It behooveth us to bow down and say: Thine is the praise, O gracious Commander, and Thine the bounty, O ancient Bestower of favors, and Thine the mercy, O Thou Who art merciful to the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou didst write that in the house of the aforementioned son, Jenab-i-Aqa S. and others, upon them be the glory of God, were present, after this was presented, this blessed verse was revealed from the heaven of divine loving-kindness:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Expositor</p>
<p>O S! Rejoice in that the Wronged One maketh mention of thee from this spot which God hath made the Dawning-place of His greatest signs and the Source of His mighty Command. We counsel thee to wisdom in all conditions and command thee to that which beseemeth man in this wondrous Day. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have seen thy turning to Us and We have turned to thee, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Generous Bestower. Look not upon the world and its conditions. Reflect upon the former ages and be of those who are discerning. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the world and Who hast appeared through the Most Great Name! I beseech Thee by the Word through which the trumpet was blown and the Day of Resurrection appeared, to make me steadfast, firm and upright in Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and within Thy grasp is the kingdom of names. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones, then send down from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will make me detached from all else save Thee. Verily, Thou art the Bestower, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We make mention of the Lion whose name was mentioned before the Presence of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, that he may rejoice and thank his Lord Who created him and aided him to recognize this inevitable Cause through which the great terror appeared among mankind and all things proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. Beware lest anything hold thee back from God. Hold fast unto the cord of bounty and cling to the hem of the mercy of thy Lord, the Forgiving. We have made mention of thee as a bounty from Us. When thou attainest unto this, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>O Nightingale! O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of the love of the Lord of Names! Give glad tidings unto Shir-Muhammad and remind him of the verses of his Lord, that he may rejoice in the appearance of the loving-kindness of his gracious Lord. We have mentioned all names as a bounty from Us, and We make mention of those who have arisen and have said: “Here am I, O God of the worlds!” Blessed is he who hath attained unto the fruits of the tree of My Most Exalted Pen. He is assuredly among those possessed of certitude in a perspicuous Book. Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Creator of Paradise and Fashioner of all created things! I beseech Thee by the Name through which humanity was attracted and the Spirit cried out in the wilderness, to make me among those whom circumstances have not prevented from Thy Hidden Name, which walketh at this time and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Taqi! Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and He hath mentioned thee with verses wherewith nothing that hath been or shall be can vie, nor can aught created between the Kaf and the Nun equal them. Verily, He remembereth thee from His prison, and those who have believed in the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Existent. Remember thy Lord through what He hath taught thee of His path and what He hath revealed unto thee, whereby the fragrance of His garment hath been diffused throughout the realms of the invisible and the visible. Beseech God to make thee steadfast in this Cause and powerful through His Name, the Mighty, the Powerful. The splendor shining from the horizon of eternity be upon those who have attained unto the mention of God, Creator of heaven, and have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Eternity hath spoken: verily there is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was the last to visit you. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower. He loveth His servants and remembereth them at eventide and at dawn. Blessed is he who seeketh His presence, who speaketh in remembrance of Him, whose countenance is turned towards Him, and whose heart hath won the light of recognition. We send Our greetings from this station to those who have believed in God, the Revealer of verses. It hath ended.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, time and again. The friends of God who dwell in that land have been blessed with His infinite divine favors. This evanescent servant conveyeth to all greetings and salutations, and submitteth that these are the days for which all divine Prophets and Messengers have waited. Therefore, one must arise with complete dedication to His mention and praise. That beloved one should counsel all with wisdom, for this is among the firm and established divine commandments revealed in the Book. They should not trust every soul, nor display their precious pearls before every eye. They should deal with people with the utmost kindness, love and forbearance. Repeatedly have such words been heard from the tongue of Him Who revealeth the verses. He would say that today righteous deeds and praiseworthy character are the promoters of the Cause of God. It is hoped that all shall be assisted to achieve that which is acceptable in the presence of God.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the second ’Ubaydullah, that rebellious oppressor, and his tyranny and transgression - it caused grief and sorrow. By God’s life! As long as the sun of justice remains behind the clouds of oppression, such matters have occurred and will continue to occur in the world. Justice is like a nightingale seen caught in the talons of the owl of tyranny. Although that oppressor’s tyranny has exceeded all bounds and description, yet when closely observed, the people of this time truly deserve it, for they have perpetrated far worse against the people of truth. That Beloved One is witness that in most of the tablets and writings, all servants have been forbidden from corruption, conflict, strife and unseemly deeds. Nevertheless, what occurred, occurred. The brother of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Husayn (Letter of the Living, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory) was eleven years old when that reckless oppressor removed his head with a cannon ball. In some places they perpetrated what the pen is powerless to describe. I beseech God to bestow justice upon the people. Consider the fire of oppression that was ignited in the land of Sad - two descendants of the Prophet were martyred without cause or reason, merely for worldly ornaments and a few coins. The curse of God be upon the oppressors! If the effects of that oppression were limited to what has already appeared, it would be well enough, but it is observed that the fruits of those deeds and their sparks will later appear in certain lands. I beseech the Almighty to grant His servants success in turning to Him, for if they achieve repentance, all matters will be reformed. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>What is being conveyed has been understood from the revealed verses - God forbid! He is indeed the Perceiver, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. That which has flowed from the Supreme Pen in God’s Book has appeared and will appear, and in the Most Holy Book there are also certain allusions. Soon will appear what He has foretold in His Mighty Book. In this Most Great Revelation, future events have been explicitly stated - blessed are they who understand. Beyond this one cannot venture - the Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>In this recent incident, whatever befell the friends and whatever losses they sustained will certainly be compensated in the most perfect and complete manner. In any case, the profit is with God’s friends. Whoever exists is blessed with the days of God and His recognition, and whoever has drunk the cup of martyrdom is seen in the highest Paradise with utmost joy and delight. If the station of martyrdom were to be revealed to the worlds in less than can be counted, you would see all drawn to the place of sacrifice. Now people are withered, nay dead. Their movements are like those of artificial figures moved by machinery - sometimes an artificial hand is raised, sometimes an artificial foot strikes the ground, and all these movements appear without consciousness. Although at present all are heedless and the worth of God’s friends is hidden from sight and eyes, yet when the appointed time comes, that which is hidden will be revealed. How fitting is what was said before: “Wait until you see as parts those who today are whole.”</p>
<p>Wait until you see as flowers those who are thorns today. The divine friends who are steadfast in the Cause should not be saddened by losses that have befallen them. Rather, they should be seen in the utmost joy and delight, and be certain that they are among the people of profit in all conditions. Would that this servant could partake of the cup from which the friends have drunk, and receive a portion of their losses. Most matters are veiled by His will - were the veil to be lifted, the earth would be seen as other than the earth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there be delay in sending petitions, this is due to the many occupations of this evanescent one; there is no other reason possible. That beloved one himself is witness and testifier to this. Therefore they must accept the excuse of this evanescent one and forgive. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>And regarding His Honor Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God - since this evanescent one has already conveyed something, no further submission is made. Wherever they may be, may they abide under the shadow of God’s mercy and favor. They had sought permission to come to this land; permission was granted. God willing, may they be assisted in attaining that which they desire.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the revelation of verses, this servant, as proxy for that beloved one, attained the honor of pilgrimage and circumambulation, and it was accepted at the Divine Throne. I praise Him and thank Him for His grace, His mercy, His favor, His generosity, His bounty and His gift.</p>
<p>Furthermore, His Holiness the Most Great Branch and His Holiness the Most Mighty Branch - may my spirit, my being and my essence be sacrificed for the dust beneath their feet - remember that beloved one with wondrous mention and magnify him with the most exalted, most holy and most glorious greeting. Glory be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon the loved ones of God who have heard and responded.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Response to the Community of Manshad - For those endowed with insight from God, it is mentioned:</p>
<p>One day I was sitting, bewildered by the Divine Cause and contemplating what had appeared in the land of Kaf and Ra (Kirman), wondering how these calumnies had arisen and how they were preventing the helpless people from the Divine Law. At that moment, I was reminded of the blessed verse of the Most Holy Book which was revealed at the beginning of imprisonment from the Holy Kingdom. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O Land of Kaf and Ra! We, verily, see in thee that which is not pleasing unto God, and We behold in thee that which none knoweth except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We perceive that which secretly and stealthily proceedeth from thee. With Us is the knowledge of all things, recorded in a lucid Tablet. Sorrow not on account of that which hath befallen thee. Erelong will God raise up within thee men possessed of mighty strength, who will magnify My Name with such constancy that neither will they be deterred by the evil suggestions of the divines, nor will they be kept back by the insinuations of the doubters. With their own eyes will they behold God, and with their own lives will they render Him victorious. These, truly, are of those who are steadfast.”</p>
<p>I said: “God, the Most High, the Most Great, speaketh the truth.” At that very moment, a letter arrived sealed by four individuals. By the life of my Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in earth and heaven, after seeing and considering it, I lamented for the Primal Point (may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him), for it was observed that the people of the Bayan had not understood a single letter of the Bayan of the All-Merciful and had not attained its purpose. For the purpose of the entire Bayan was the recognition of this Most Great Manifestation - were it not for Him, the Bayan would not have been revealed nor would its Revealer have appeared. Bewilderment was added to bewilderment, for that blessed Being throughout the entire Bayan counsels all to turn towards, submit to, and become as nothing before this Most Great Manifestation. How well the divine covenant was fulfilled and His testament carried out! The copy of the letter that arrived is exactly this, and at the beginning of their letter, the name of the Truth, exalted be His glory, is not mentioned […]</p>
<p>God is my witness to what hath befallen this evanescent servant. The Primal Point–may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake–hath said: “Whatever ye desire on that Day, ask ye it now from Me.” And He hath said: “I have not failed to counsel this people, nor to devise means for their allegiance to their Lord and their faith in God, their Creator. Should they believe in Him on the day of His manifestation, all who dwell on earth would at that time rejoice, as would Mine own Essence, for all would have attained the summit of their existence, would have gained access to the countenance of their Beloved, and would have apprehended all that was possible within contingent being from the revelation of their Object of desire. Otherwise, My heart would be saddened, for I have nurtured all things for this purpose–how then could anyone remain veiled?” Thus concludeth His mighty and exalted utterance.</p>
<p>And He saith, blessed and exalted be His words: “O God! Do Thou nurture all who are in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever lieth between them for the day of Thy manifestation, that when the Manifestation of Thy Self reciteth a verse from Thee, all may declare: ‘Yea, praise be unto Thee! There is none other God but Thee! We all do truly believe in what God hath promised us in the Bayan.’”</p>
<p>How well they heeded the counsels of God! A hundred thousand praises upon the people of the Bayan! He declareth that at the mere hearing of a single verse all would acknowledge Him. Now, the equivalent of all heavenly Books–nay, more–hath been sent down in every mode from the heaven of God’s Will. Yet they write anew asking for details about the pregnant mirror-bearer from Manshad–what she carrieth in her womb and when she will deliver! By the life of my Beloved, and the Beloved of all who are in earth and heaven, the very eye of justice weepeth, and equity crieth out in anguish!</p>
<p>In the thirteenth chapter of the second Vahid of the Bayan He says, exalted be His glory, the gist of this chapter is that no questions are permitted concerning Him Whom God shall make manifest except about that which befits His station, for His station is the pure manifestation itself, such that even the essence of manifestation in the essence of manifestation appears in His shadow. Despite this clear and evident command, now observe what the people of the Bayan have said and done and what questions they have asked. O people! Fear God and do not invalidate the truth through your own imaginings. Cast aside that to which you cling and turn unto Him. Verily He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Do they imagine that today any thing among things or any matter among matters can benefit anyone? Nay, by the Self of the All-Merciful! All that is thereon shall perish save those who have clung to His cord and held fast to His hem.</p>
<p>One of the provisions of the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Bayan is that He says at the beginning of every nineteenth year, each of the people of the Bayan should write to one another a book proving Him Whom God shall make manifest. His purpose was that at the appointed time of the Manifestation, which is the nineteenth year as is known in the Book of Temples, the tongue, pen and thought of all should be occupied with His remembrance and the proof of His Cause, and that no word of denial should issue from any soul. Glory be to God! Now in the Supreme Horizon He observes what has transpired and what they have said. It is most strange that such things have appeared from the people of Manshad.</p>
<p>In any case, after observing the letter, this servant was perplexed whether to present it before His countenance or conceal it, fearing lest there be some negligence in concealing it. Therefore, placing my trust in God, I intended to approach the Most Exalted Station and Supreme Summit until I arrived and stood silent and speechless until He, exalted be His glory, said: “O servant who is present! What do you have in your hand?” I submitted: “A letter has come.” He commanded: “Read it to the end.” It was submitted. Then the Tongue of the All-Bountiful spoke these exalted words in reply:</p>
<p>“O servant who is present! What became of the divine counsels? Where have all those covenants and pledges gone? Today the Mother Book speaks and the Mother of the Bayan is manifest. These matters were not and are not worthy of mention. They have not taken their portion from the ocean of divine counsel nor received their share from the sea of the All-Merciful’s wisdom. Any soul who today, after hearing this Most Great Cause, hesitates less than that is not worthy of mention. All books are dependent and conditioned upon the Word of this Manifestation. Today no mention and no deed benefits except by God’s leave, exalted be His glory. Say: The Will of God is other than your wills, and His way is other than your ways. He walks not in your paths nor follows your desires. He calls those on earth and guides them to His straight path. Whoso turns toward Him has attained all good, and whoso turns away is among the people of the fire in a mighty Book.</p>
<p>O servant who is present! It would be most regrettable if the people of the Bayan were to be seen as more lost than the people of the Furqan. After centuries and ages of tribulation, the final fruit of their deeds was that they unanimously martyred the Lord of the world, both the learned and the ignorant. I abhor using the word ‘curse’, otherwise the Supreme Pen would have written: ‘Lo! The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people!’ In this Most Great Manifestation […]”</p>
<p>O servants! I abhor the word “curse,” else the Supreme Pen would have declared: “Lo! The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people!” In this Most Great Revelation and Momentous Announcement, the Supreme Pen has saved certain divines and raised them from the pit of fancy and vain imaginings. We now beseech God for their steadfastness. In one of the Tablets it is revealed: The divines in this Revelation are as sight unto the body of the world and as spirit unto physical forms. May God protect them from the deceit and trickery of heedless souls.</p>
<p>O servants! This is the Day of revelation and witnessing. Occupy not yourselves with questions and answers. Arise in truth to serve the Cause. In one of the Tablets this most great verse was revealed: “This is not the Day for questions. It behooveth him who hath heard the Call from the Supreme Horizon to arise and say: ‘Here am I, O God of Names! Here am I, O Desire of the worlds!’”</p>
<p>Say: O servants! Hatred and animosity are unseemly. All must arise with complete determination to extinguish this world-consuming fire, that the world may be purified and adorned as befitteth it. Ye have all witnessed the Shi’ih sect - ye all know their claims and the deeds and actions of that party. Now strive that perchance the people may be preserved from the fire of self and passion.</p>
<p>O fair-minded ones! Consider the recent letter which the people of Manshad wrote in rejection of the Truth and opposition to it, sealing it with their seals, and likewise consider the gathering of the idolaters in the Mother City, what conditions they set for faith, saying that if these appeared they would believe, and if not, then nay. God, exalted be His glory, speaks through the tongue of those idolaters, blessed and exalted be His Word: “And they say: ‘We shall not believe in thee until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth; or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as thou hast pretended; or thou bring God and the angels face to face with us; or thou have a house adorned with gold; or thou ascend up into heaven; and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension until thou bring down for us a book that we can read.’”</p>
<p>That which is mentioned is for pure and assured souls; otherwise, it increaseth the wrongdoers in naught but loss. O people of the earth! Hear ye the words of the All-Merciful in the Qur’an. He relateth that the idolaters said: “We will not believe in thee until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth, or thou have a garden of date-palms and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth abundantly therein, or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces as thou hast claimed, or thou bring God and the angels as a surety, or thou have a house of gold, or thou ascend to heaven.” And then from the depths of their hatred they said: “We will not believe in thy ascension unless thou bring down for us a book that we can read.” Such was their hardheartedness that they said: “O God! If this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down stones on us from heaven, or bring us a painful doom!”</p>
<p>In reflecting upon the conditions of faith for those souls and the conditions of faith for these new souls, much contemplation is required. Blessed are they who are awake and alert - those souls who have been awakened by the divine breeze and have turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, detached from the world and all that is therein. By the life of God! These are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark mentioned by the Supreme Pen in the Book of Names. Today the Primal Point laments, and all things are saddened, for they have denied Him whose station equals all the books before and after that descended from the heaven of His Will, and whose manifestations of power and grandeur shone forth like the sun. Glory be to God! How hath heedlessness so seized these souls that after years of reading the Qur’an, they remained so unaware as to speak like the idolaters. A hundred thousand pities that the people of the Bayan have been afflicted with the chronic diseases of old. Ibn-i-Ja’far-i-Kirmani claimed: “I possess a hundred books from the Primal Point and so-and-so.” Say: Thou hast lied, by the Lord of the Ka’bah! By God, thou hast spoken without justice. In any case, whatever is from the Primal Point must be sent to the Most Holy Court, for it depends upon acceptance, and as for that which is from others - read some of it and judge fairly. By the life of God! It cannot compare with a single verse. We are not concerned with rejection or acceptance, but for the sake of God We say this much: you had and have no knowledge of the foundation of the Cause and its Founder. By the life of God! This one word would guide the fair-minded to the sweet and flowing fountain, but now you are found sleeping. Ask God to awaken you with the breezes of the springtime of divine knowledge and draw you to the Most Exalted Horizon. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen laments for itself, for matters have reached such a state that the Truth Itself writes proofs. O ye who possess ears, hearken with pure ears to this verse of the Qur’an. His blessed words, exalted is He: “If the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein would have been corrupted.” He says that if the Truth had followed their desires, surely the heavens and earth and all within them would have been corrupted. O people! Hear the call of the Wronged One and abandon your desires. Fix your gaze upon the Will of God and hold fast to His Purpose. He manifests whatsoever He willeth. Blessed is the one whose will is annihilated in His Will and whose desire is dissolved in His Desire. Thus hath spoken the Truth, and He guideth the Way.</p>
<p>Now contemplate the attributes of the assured believer of whom God hath given tidings. His blessed words, exalted is He: “And when they hear what hath been revealed to the Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say: ‘Our Lord, we believe; write us down among the witnesses.’” And concerning the idolaters and opponents who have taken their own desires as proof for themselves, He says, blessed and exalted is He: “Even if We had sent down the angels unto them, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered all things before them, they would not have believed unless God had so willed. However, most of them are ignorant.” This blessed verse refers to souls who have ever risen in opposition and clung to their own desires rather than to proof […]</p>
<p>They have clung to their vain imaginings and turned away from the proof and testimony of God, exalted be His glory. He saith: “Even if We had sent down the angels unto them, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together before them all things in multitude, they would not have believed in God, exalted be His glory.” And “They swear their strongest oaths by God that if a sign should come to them, they would surely believe in it. Say: Signs are in the power of God alone, and what will make you realize that even if they came, they would not believe?” O assembly of Minshad! Be not as those who in the time of the Seal said: “By God, if He should turn Mount Safa into gold, or raise our dead to testify to the truth of His prophethood, we would believe.” Throughout all His verses, God, exalted be His glory, hath rejected the deniers and made mention of those who are assured of His signs, in a manner befitting their faith and their turning unto God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Moreover He saith, blessed and exalted be He: “Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord, or certain of the signs of thy Lord? The day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then.” Now ponder upon these verses and take heed, that perchance through divine proof and testimony ye may find your way to the straight path.</p>
<p>Concerning those souls who turn away from the rays of the Sun of Certitude, the Blessed and Exalted One declares: “Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Surely conjecture can be of no avail against Truth. Verily God is well aware of all they do.” Ponder upon this blessed verse. Concerning those souls who are deprived and forbidden from seeing and hearing, He says, blessed and exalted be He: “Among them are some who listen to thee; but canst thou make the deaf to hear even though they are devoid of understanding? And among them are some who look toward thee; but canst thou guide the blind even though they see not? Take heed, O ye who are endued with understanding!”</p>
<p>Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, and turn from ignorance to knowledge, from turning away to acceptance, and strive to proceed from the rivulet to the Most Great Ocean, that ye may not be deprived of the outpourings of the True Bestower. This is the Day of vision, for the highest horizon is resplendent and manifest, and the Day of hearing, for the call of the Intended One is raised. This is that Day which hath been mentioned in all the Books and Scriptures. This deafness and blindness is indeed divine retribution and the recompense of deeds, yet we beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist all and deprive none from the ocean of divine unity on this Day.</p>
<p>Consider this objection of the idolaters, that perchance the breeze of fairness may waft from the direction of the heart and purify all members. The Blessed and Exalted One declares: “Those who disbelieve say: ‘Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?’” Observe how whatever was manifested from God, exalted be His glory, the idolaters were not content therewith, but desired according to their own vain imaginings whatsoever they wished. O ye who count yourselves as believers, do ye acknowledge or not that He “doeth whatsoever He willeth, and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth”? Ye must today contemplate with fairness the proof of God and consider His evidence. By the life of God! This is spoken for the sake of God. The harm and benefit of the world revert to its people, as every discerning one and every informed sage doth testify. Fear God, O people, and be not among the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Consider this verse: “If there were a Qur’an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak…” The purpose is that the idolaters of Quraysh and those who turned away demanded such things from that holy Being that they might believe. The heavens lament and the dwellers of the highest Paradise wail. The idolaters of that age clung to such matters, and now certain followers of the Bayan are observed to be lower than those souls, for they have asked Him to reveal the gender of an expectant woman, who she is, what she carries in her womb and when she will deliver. Verily the very essence of seeking forgiveness doth ask forgiveness in this station for what they have said and say. Glory be to God! Is the mention of such matters befitting? Nay, by God! Yet this Wronged One standeth alone in the Cause and beseecheth God not to deprive His servants on this Day. Now the equivalent of all the Books of God, past and future, hath been revealed and is present. Reflect upon that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. In this Revelation hath appeared that which hath not appeared since the beginning of creation, yet turning away hath blinded the outward eye […]</p>
<p>Consider what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. In this Revelation there hath appeared what hath never appeared from the beginning of creation until now. Yet opposition preventeth both the outward and inward eye from beholding. We beseech God that He may grant deliverance unto all and not deprive them from the oceans of His mercy. O ye that are gathered together! I say unto you in truth that throughout all ages and centuries the evil ones among the people have ever been occupied with such objections. This is not the first Command that hath appeared in the Bayan, nor the first vessel that hath been broken in Islam, nor the first matter concerning which they have objected to the Prophets and Messengers. They objected to the Spirit (Christ), saying “If Thou be the Truth, command this stone to become bread,” or “Cast Thyself down from above.” He saith: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God’s will.” And it is also written: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” Can they perceive the fragrance of these utterances and taste the sweetness of the Divine Word? This is most difficult unless the eyes, ears and hearts be cleansed through the water of return and repentance. He guideth whom He willeth and leadeth astray whom He pleaseth, and He is powerful over all things. This is a Day wherein all must show forth obedience and turn with complete submission and contentment, offering praise unto God with both their outer and inner tongues. Instead of gratitude they have drawn forth the sword, and in place of submission they have kindled the fire of hatred. Where are they whom names have not kept back from their Creator, and where are they whom the might of sovereignty hath not frightened in the days of God? O ye seekers who claim to be of the Shi’ih sect! Reflect, that perchance the tales and stories of old may not prevent you from the Day-Star of the divine kingdom and deprive you from the ocean of utterance. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth to the Way. Whoso believeth, it shall be to his own benefit; and whoso turneth away, it shall be to his own loss. God is independent of all the worlds. O ye who claim knowledge! Consider this verse - blessed and exalted be His Word: “Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion? God hath, knowing him as such, led him astray, and sealed up his hearing and his heart, and put a covering on his sight. Who, then, will guide him after God? Will ye not then be mindful?”</p>
<p>Take heed of the words of Truth, exalted be His glory. The days are passing swiftly. By the life of God, these objections were and are unworthy of the divine days. This is the day whereof He saith, “The earth shall shine with the light of her Lord.” This is the day whereof He saith, “The dwellers of Sinai shall be struck with thunderous awe.” Take refuge in Truth, glorified be His majesty, and with pure hearts and sanctified vision turn towards the Most Exalted Horizon. I swear by the light of the Sun of Evidence which hath shone from the highest horizon of the world that this Wronged One hath gone beyond your faith and the faith of others. For twelve hundred years and more, people like you took pride before other sects in what they possessed, and in gatherings and from pulpits they occupied themselves with disputation, contention, revilement and cursing of one another, imagining they were serving God. In the end, the fruit of all their deeds was their agreement to shed most holy blood. Now too these souls desire to occupy themselves with cursing, reviling and disputation for another thousand years, ultimately reaching the same fruit as the previous sect, namely the Shi’ih party. What strange intoxication and what strange heedlessness hath seized them all! From the beginning of Islam until the first day of the Manifestation, not one of the Shi’ih divines was aware of the nature of the Manifestation and the presence of that Essence of Being in the loins. This was the station of your previous divines who possessed not an atom’s weight of knowledge. Were they to reflect somewhat on this matter, they would cry out. Now the time of the previous sect hath passed, and the time of the Bayani sect hath come. Say what ye wish. That which was incumbent upon Truth, glorified be His majesty, He hath proclaimed in most eloquent terms before the faces of all the world. All things bear witness to this, if ye be not of them that deny. Judge fairly: after the effulgences of the Sun of the Bayan of the All-Merciful, and the waves of the ocean of divine knowledge, and the manifestations of the Luminary of inner meanings in the gathering of the world, is it befitting to speak like the former deniers? Nay, worse still! By God! Sanctify your hearts from the veils of idle fancies and desire, that perchance ye may hearken to the wondrous, delicate melodies of the Bird of inner meanings, warbling upon the highest branch of understanding, and may find yourselves detached and free from the world and all who dwell therein, and soar with the wings of freedom in the atmosphere of justice and fairness. It would be regrettable were ye to be seen as like unto the former deniers. By the life of God, were it not for the Most Exalted Pen, the veils and coverings would have prevented all. Now that some of the veils have been rent asunder by the power of the Most Exalted Pen, perchance a few souls may find and remain steadfast. Observe how the verses have encompassed the world and how the evidences have become more manifest than the sun, yet despite this they have forgotten the divine counsels and broken His covenant and testament, and have perpetrated that which pen and utterance fail to describe. O servant! We conclude with these words, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “Verily, thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they turn their backs and flee.” And it is better that we pass beyond all this and occupy ourselves with the remembrance of God.</p>
<p>O my God, my Adored One, my King! I bear witness that Thou art not to be known through the attributes of Thy creatures, nor described through the praises of created things. The perceptions of the world and the minds of nations cannot fittingly enter the precincts of Thy sanctity, nor comprehend it. What error has caused the dwellers of the City of Names to be withheld from Thine exalted horizon and deprived from drawing nigh unto Thy Most Great Ocean? A single letter from Thy Book is the Mother of all Utterance, and one word therefrom is the Source of all Being. What ingratitude has appeared from Thy servants that Thou hast withheld them all from knowing Thee! One drop from the ocean of Thy mercy can quench the flames of hell, and one spark from the fire of Thy love can set the world ablaze. O All-Knowing One! Though we are heedless, yet we cling to Thy grace, and though we are ignorant, we turn to the ocean of Thy knowledge. Thou art He Whose abundance of grace is not hindered by the multitude of errors, nor is Thy bounty impeded by the world’s rejection. The gate of Thy grace has forever been open. A dewdrop from the ocean of Thy mercy can adorn all with the ornament of sanctity, and a sprinkle from the sea of Thy generosity can endow all existence with true wealth. O Concealer! Remove not the veil. Ever have the manifestations of Thy grace encompassed the world, and the lights of Thy Most Great Name have shone upon all. Deprive not Thy servants of the wonders of Thy grace, and grant them awareness that they may testify to Thy oneness, and bestow upon them recognition that they may hasten unto Thee. Thy mercy hath encompassed all created things and Thy grace hath embraced all. From the waves of the ocean of Thy bestowals have appeared the seas of seeking and yearning. All that exists is Thee; what is besides Thee is unworthy of mention save through entering beneath Thy shadow and arriving at Thy court. In every state we seek Thy ancient forgiveness and search for Thy boundless grace. We hope that Thou wilt not deprive any soul of Thy grace nor withhold from anyone the ornament of justice and fairness. Thou art the Sovereign of generosity, the Lord of bounty, and the One Who ruleth over all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>The spirit of the world be a sacrifice unto His call, and unto His remembrance, and unto His utterance! By the life of my Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in earth and heaven! At the time of the revelation of these verses, from beginning to end, all the realities of the Prophets and Messengers were present, and all the Concourse on High and dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise were seized by the attraction of the utterance of the All-Merciful. God is witness and bearer of testimony to what befell this servant at the time of utterance - all limbs and members were agitated and convulsed, and from all directions sorrows encompassed me, that the people of the Bayan should act thus despite the counsels of the All-Merciful. Glory be to God! This servant is astonished at how quickly the veils and idle fancies have encompassed the people. The Exalted One - may the spirit of all who are in the kingdom of Command and Creation be a sacrifice unto Him - proclaims with the most elevated call, His word, exalted and mighty: “I have written a gem concerning His remembrance: He shall not be known through My allusions, nor through what is mentioned in the Bayan.” Do the people of the Bayan consider these words, which flowed from the lips of the Primal Point’s Will - may the spirit of all else be a sacrifice unto Him - to be false or true? If, God forbid, they deem it false, then no further word remains. And if they accept it as true, what then are these words and these objections? Well done to the people of the Bayan! How firmly they have girded their loins to block the gates of divine bounties and how ready they are to prevent His mercy! This evanescent servant implores and beseeches you to fix your gaze upon the truth and upon that which hath appeared from His presence. Have you not witnessed and hath there not appeared from the Truth even as much as you desired? Look ye in the revealed Books - whatsoever hath later come to pass had already flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, but there is neither sight nor hearing to observe and take heed. This servant hath no word with anyone. What he had to say, he hath said; this was his duty and he hath discharged it. Guidance and error are in the hand of God, exalted be His glory. Yet he hath not failed, nor will he fail, to pray. The Command is in the hand of our Lord, our Beloved, our Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in the heavens and the earth. And I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid these mentioned souls to return and repent, that perchance God may remit their misdeeds and transgressions, whereby the hearts of the people of Paradise have melted, the Concourse on High have lamented, and this evanescent servant was struck unconscious. For a time this servant remained unconscious and stupefied. After recovering consciousness and awakening, I besought the Self-Sufficient One with utmost lowliness and supplication not to deprive His servants of the splendors of the Sun of Divine Unity, for this is truly the Day of Divine Unity. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized the Day and the Lord of the Day. This is the Day of the blessed word “There is none other God but He.” Hearken unto the call of this evanescent servant, and while there is yet time, arise to redeem that which hath passed you by. The greatness of this Day hath been mentioned in the Books of old and of recent times, and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. This evanescent servant beseecheth God to aid all to perform such deeds as befit this mighty Day, and to grant His confirmation that all may turn their faces to the eternal countenance and advance toward the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>At the close, this evanescent servant makes mention of a word, and it is this: Let them ask, with the utmost courtesy, from their own source one of those questions which they posed here with complete discourtesy, and after witnessing how different is the reality from what they had imagined, let them turn towards the Most Holy Court, that they may gain awareness and attain unto the knowledge of God, and recognize the station of this Day and true unity. This is the most great mercy and the supreme bounty, if they be enabled to achieve it. Would that the people might recognize Him! Would that the people might know! Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return. Glory be upon the people of Baha who were not prevented by the intimations of the people of the Bayan, those who turned away from the All-Merciful when He came to them with manifest sovereignty. And praise be to God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>15 Shawwal 1302</p>
<p>He is God</p>
<p>After several days when no answer descended from the heaven of divine will, this servant once again, for the sake of God, submits these few words to the possessors of attentive ears, that perchance they may recognize the station of Truth and, through the fragrance of utterance, turn to the horizon of the All-Merciful. The people of the assembly, meaning those four souls, seek tidings of the unseen, saying “We do not understand the verses.” This statement greatly affected this servant, for it contradicts the divine verses. In the eighth chapter of the sixth Vahid of the Bayan, He says - exalted and glorified be His words: “Whoso seeks proof in aught save the Book of God and the verses of the Bayan, while all are powerless to produce the like thereof, hath no proof. And whoso relates miracles other than these, there is no truth in it…” until His exalted words: “that perchance on the Day of the Manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, no ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ shall be uttered concerning Him.” Would that only ‘why’ and ‘wherefore’ had been uttered! That which no oppressor had ever spoken was spoken. Those souls who say “We do not understand the verses” - do they not even understand their obvious meaning? Let them ponder the blessed Surih of Ra’is and judge fairly. All that subsequently came to pass had been previously revealed from the Supreme Pen with utmost clarity. Let a group gather, free from hatred, and examine that Surih. By the life of our Lord! Word for word it hath been made manifest in the visible world. Let them observe and judge fairly, and return from the desert of heedlessness to the field of awareness, and from the darkness of fancy and conjecture to the light of certitude. Fear God, O people, and be not among the transgressors. Be not like the heedless Shi’ih party who would first lament from the pulpit the oppression of the Letters of the Furqan, and then at the end would curse the Chief of those Letters and decree His death. In any case, by the testimony of the Bayan and the Furqan and the divine Books, the sending of that concordant writing was an error - an error whose record would be most difficult to erase from the book of deeds, save through clear repentance. They must seek forgiveness by night and day; perchance He may forgive them and expiate what they have committed. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Glory be to God! They have said that which its error is clear and evident to every soul. O united souls! What tidings of the unseen did ye hear from the Exalted One? In the first year of the Manifestation, ye were all heedless and turned away. What unseen thing was then revealed that ye became believers? Now observe that which is above it and far above it, and judge fairly. God is witness and testifier that in what hath been submitted, I had and have no purpose save His good-pleasure and the salvation of His servants. Verily He knoweth what is in the hearts and what is in the breasts, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>=== END BH00095 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00096 ===</p>
<p>He is God, Exalted be His Glory, the Greatness and Power</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who made tribulation as water for His Lote Tree on High and His Ultimate Tree, and a light for His chosen servants that He might show them the path of attainment to the Supreme Companion and the Most Glorious Station. Through it the horizon of certitude shone forth amidst all possibility, and the temples of assurance appeared among the concourse of religions. Verily it is the sword whereby God separated between His servants and His creation, and through it the doubters retreated while those possessed of certitude advanced toward the Dawning-Place of their Lord’s loving-kindness, the Generous Bestower. Blessed is the soul whom tribulation failed to deter from turning toward the Supreme Horizon, and whom worldly affairs did not prevent from gazing toward the direction of its Lord, the Mighty, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>All things testify with every tongue that he is the one certain in God, standing firm in God’s Cause, speaking of God, turning toward God, moving by God’s leave, and breathing through love of God. He is indeed the one whom the Point of the Bayan mentioned in His words: “I and those in Paradise yearn for a soul who is martyred in His path.” I testify that those who were adorned with this supreme embroidery and illumined by this most brilliant light are the Name of God, the ?a in the land of ?ad, then the name of ?a, then he who was named Kazim. These are servants who turned, attained, heard, and ascended to a station which, by God, pens and the tongues of the peoples of all lands are powerless to describe. Glory be upon them, praise be upon them, and light be upon them from God, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>And then, O beloved of my heart and the one remembered in my soul, the singing of the birds that warbled upon the branches of your utterance and the trees of your love attracted me and drew me to the Ultimate Station and the Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Great, Most Glorious Presence of our Lord. When I appeared, the Lord of the World spoke: “What is that in your right hand?” I presented the book sent by him who arose to serve Your Mighty Cause. Then He commanded me to read, and I presented what was in it before His Face. When it was finished, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke again: “He is among those who have attained a bounty which every soul is powerless to mention. We have rained down upon him from the clouds of grace that which none can reckon save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We have sent to him each year that which establishes God’s Cause and His proof among His servants, but the people are in evident veils.” End.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar who in the previous year, for the love of God, carried Tablets and delivered them to their recipients, this is what was revealed in response:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious […]</p>
<p>Thou hast previously attained unto My remembrance, and this is yet another time when My Most Exalted Pen remembereth thee from this lofty station. Blessed is the servant who acteth in accordance with what hath been ordained by God, the Lord of all worlds, and whom the attraction of the Call hath so seized that he hath cast away his idle fancies and taken what hath been bestowed from a gracious Bestower. Thou hast drunk the cup of recognition from the hand of the bounty of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and it behooveth thee to drink the cup of contentment from the fingers of the grace of the Lord of Names, Who hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. Thou must, in all conditions, fix thy gaze upon the Truth and, detached from thy desires, act according to His good-pleasure. Thy remembrance hath been made time and again at the Most Holy Court, and wondrous verses have been sent down repeatedly from the heaven of loving-kindness. This is that remembrance which hath been and shall forever be enduring. Rejoice thou and be of the thankful ones. However, thou must protect this most exalted station through the Name of God and be gladdened by that which hath been commanded. What joy could be greater than this, that the Beloved of the world should remember thee from the Most Great Prison? Thou must, with complete trust and detachment, engage in service to the Cause of God with spirit and fragrance. He, verily, is the Commander, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. He writeth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of attaining His presence. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the deceased Dervish Baqir and his legacy, it was submitted. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed in reply: Blessed is he for having fulfilled his covenant and held fast to the Testament. He attained unto the recognition of God in days wherein the ocean of tribulation surged and the clamor of the people of hypocrisy was raised. He is of them who drank the choice wine of recognition and attained unto the days of God, the Possessor of the Day of Separation. We made mention of him before his ascension and after his passing, as a token of Our grace, and We are the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>As to what was written concerning the funds, they said to act according to his will when deemed appropriate and send it to the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Haji Ghulam-’Ali, the details about him were previously written by the honored physician, upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], and a reply was written to them. Let action be taken accordingly.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write that the aforementioned one hath borne your troubles, how fortunate that he hath attained unto this blessing. I beseech the Most High to grant him success in similar matters and aid him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. He, verily, is the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Convey My greetings to him on behalf of this servant.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Aqa Muhammad, that he resideth in Sulaymaniyyih in the room of Aqa Muhammad Hasan and hath attained unto the honor of belief, these matters were submitted to the Most Holy Court. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Most Mighty, the Most Ancient, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a letter from the Wronged One to him who hath drawn nigh unto the Most Great Sea that he might drink the living waters from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the All-Merciful, and be of them that know. O Muhammad! We have heard thy call and witnessed thy turning towards Us, and We make mention of thee from this exalted station. This is a station named the Most Great Prison and by all names, yet most of the people are heedless. We counsel thee, O Muhammad, to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause wherein the feet of the mystics have slipped, save whom God, the Bestower, the Bountiful, hath willed. Hold fast unto the cord of the Command and say:</p>
<p>O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the hearts of the sincere ones have soared and the minds of them who are nigh unto Thee have been attracted, to make me in all conditions turn towards the horizon of Thy grace and speak Thy praise. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: Glorified art Thou, O Creator of heaven and Sovereign over all names! I beseech Thee by the Lamp that was surrounded by the winds of discord throughout all regions, and by the Name through which was revealed that which lay hidden within the treasuries of Thy power and the depositories of Thy might, to aid me to remain steadfast in Thy love. O my Lord! I am he who hath turned toward Thee and sought the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy grace. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me in Thy days and to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all Thy worlds. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and from Thy knowledge the movement of all things escapeth not. Thou art, in truth, the Lord of all men and the Ruler of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>In the Name of the One True God!</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen ever mentioneth those who are turned towards the Most Glorious Horizon with the most exalted call, and summoneth them to the straight path of God which hath appeared through the Most Great Word. O friends! No book can be read save by one who is versed in its language, and thus its teaching and learning hath never been, nor ever shall be, free from effort. But the Book of the world is written in such clear characters that every unlettered one can read it, and every people among the peoples of the earth can comprehend it, for inscribed thereon in manifest script are the stations of evanescence and nothingness, of change and transformation. Blessed is the soul that turneth thereunto and becometh mindful thereof. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of certitude, which shineth from the prison horizon, that should anyone ponder and reflect thereon, he would find himself detached and free, in such wise that the cares and sorrows of the world and all else besides would have no effect upon him, and he would account them all as non-existent and void. Beseech ye God that He may grant unto all a portion of the heavenly table and of the everlasting bounty. He is, verily, the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. Let not time slip away; arise to that which behooveth you in the days of the Friend. He is, in truth, the Counselor, the Trustworthy. Glory be upon the letter B and upon those who have attained unto the knowledge of God and have arisen to serve His Cause, the firm, the mighty.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written concerning Jinab-i-Mirza Mahmud, He said: “I swear by the Most Great Name that God, exalted be His glory, has mentioned and continues to mention all the friends, and has manifested Himself so that all may attain the honor of His presence. However, the hatred of tyrannical nations has become a barrier. Those souls who, in truth, with perfect sincerity and purity, with utter nothingness and complete detachment, desire to attain the presence of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and who, in compliance with the binding command, refrain from coming and are content with His good-pleasure, which is the ultimate purpose - assuredly the reward of attainment unto His presence shall be written for such souls and shall be recorded by the Divine Pen in the eternal scroll. Whatsoever He doeth today has been and shall be based on consummate wisdom. All must be content with it. Praise be to God that Mahmud has attained the grace of the Lord of existence. Now he must occupy himself with matters that cause the exaltation of God’s Cause. This very service to which he has arisen is most beloved in the sight of God. However, counsel ye all to wisdom. The Glory be upon him and upon him who was named Baba from among the people of Kha, from God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>And regarding what ye wrote about Darvish Ghulam-Husayn from Malayer and Mulla Asadu’llah from that land, it was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. He said: “Darvish Ghulam-Husayn has attained the grace of the Most Great Prison and the presence of the Beloved of the world. He must at all times beseech the Self-Sufficient Lord that this great achievement remain preserved. Today is the day when all are commanded and obligated to serve the Cause, and service to the Cause in the first instance consists of deeds and actions that cause the exaltation of God’s Cause among His servants and manifest the essence of humanity on earth. All the friends must beseech God, exalted be His bounty and great be His favor, that they may attain to this lofty station, this most exalted summit, and this ultimate purpose of human existence. Verily, He is the All-Seeing Witness and the Generous Giver.”</p>
<p>And regarding Jinab-i-Mulla Asadu’llah, this is what God hath revealed in response:</p>
<p>He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Glorious […]</p>
<p>A Book sent down by the All-Merciful for all who are in the realm of possibility, that it might draw them to the supreme horizon and the Most Glorious Station. He, verily, is the One Who has power over whatsoever He willeth. To this all things bear witness, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have cast aside their God and taken their vain imaginings, following those who have turned away from the ocean of knowledge and who wander in the wilderness of ignorance with manifest delusion. The cry hath been raised between earth and heaven, and the gate of attainment hath been opened, yet they remain asleep. Vain fancies have so seized them that they have turned away from Him by Whom the horizon of certitude hath been illumined. O Lion! There hath come before the Wronged One a letter wherein mention was made of thee. We make mention of thee as a token of Our grace. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing Remembrancer. Be thou enkindled with the fire of the love of God and adorned with the light of His knowledge. He, verily, is with whosoever hath turned toward His supreme horizon and is numbered among those endued with certainty. Beware lest the affairs of the peoples prevent thee from the Ancient King. Leave the world to its people and hold fast unto My strong cord. This is a Remembrance before which all remembrances have prostrated themselves, and a Tablet before which all tablets have bowed down. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Wise Explainer. When thou hast attained unto it, preserve it by Our command, then recite it with joy and fragrance. Thus doth the Dawning-Place of thy Lord’s revelation, the All-Merciful, command thee–He Who hath endured tribulation and adversity in His straight Path. This is a Day wherein that which was hidden hath appeared and that which was concealed hath come with a sovereignty that the oppressors’ might hath failed to withhold. We speak by night and by day amongst the people: There is none other God but He, the One, the All-Informed. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the heaven of utterance with the sun of certitude. Blessed is he who hath turned toward it and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds, for having made known unto me the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, and the Manifestation of Thy mighty and glorious Cause!” This is the Day of service. Those faces that have turned unto God must, with the utmost joy and fragrance, wisdom and utterance, engage in teaching the Cause of God, that perchance the dead in the valleys of perplexity and ignorance might be quickened by the drops from the ocean of life and be adorned with the new robe of living existence. Hereafter, be thou not grieved outwardly. The Cause is in His hands. He ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth the reward of His presence and meeting. He, verily, is the Munificent Bestower.</p>
<p>And concerning the mention of Mulla ’Isa that was made, when presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, He said: “Well done, O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin. Today all souls must, with their entire being, turn to hear the Divine Call and act upon that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of the Cause.” Write to ’Isa: “Thy mention was made in the Most Great Prison before the Wronged One, and thy call was heard. Reflect upon that which hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen. I swear by the Divine Ocean of Knowledge that there hath been sent down that which the pens of the world are powerless to reckon.” In a Tablet wherein mention was made of the Wolf, that is, Shaykh Baqir who resideth in the Land of Sad, this blessed verse was revealed: “Dost thou object to Him Who hath brought thee what thou possessest and what all the peoples of the world possess of the testimonies of God and His signs? Open thy eyes that thou mayest behold the Wronged One risen from the horizon of God’s Will, the Sovereign, the Truth, the Manifest. Then open thy heart’s ear that thou mayest hear that which the Tree uttereth, which hath been raised up in truth by God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Verily the Tree, despite what it hath suffered from thy tyranny and the oppression of thy like, calleth out in the loudest voice and summoneth all unto the Divine Lote-Tree and the Supreme Horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath beheld the Most Great Sign and the ear that hath heard its sweetest call, and woe unto every denier, every sinner. O thou who hast turned away from God! If thou were to behold the Tree with an eye of fairness, thou wouldst see the marks of thy swords upon its twigs and branches and leaves, after God had created thee to know it and serve it. Reflect that thou mayest become aware of thy tyranny and be of them that repent.”</p>
<p>And in another passage of that Tablet this blessed verse was revealed: “Dost thou deny the verses of thy Lord, which when sent down from the heaven of the Cause, before them did bow down all the books of the world? Reflect that thou mayest become aware of thy deed, O heedless outcast!”</p>
<p>O ’Isa! Observe how, despite these clear signs and manifest and resplendent evidences, in what state the people are and with what deeds they are occupied. The verses of God have encompassed the whole world and His evidences shine forth like the sun from the horizon of the heaven of power, yet despite this the people are engaged in their own idle fancies and are deprived of the Sovereign of certitude. O ’Isa! Strive that perchance in these divine days thou mayest attain unto that which merits mention by the Supreme Pen. The world shall pass away like lightning, nay swifter still. Hold fast unto that which shall endure for thee in the Kingdom of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. God willing, thou shalt drink of the choice sealed wine and share it with them that are worthy. Whatever may occur to the mind hath been revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge in infinite Tablets, but due to the tyranny and transgression of the people of the world there hath been no opportunity for their publication and dissemination. The time shall come when God will manifest that which He hath willed. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst meet the friends of God who are in those parts, convey to them greetings and gladden them all with the bounty and favor of God. Say: “Glory be to Thee, O Thou before Whose mention and praise all tongues are powerless! I beseech Thee by the Name through opposition to which the tyrants among Thy creatures have arisen, to make me in all conditions regardful of Thy horizon and content with what Thou hast ordained by the Pen of Thy decree. Then write down for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily Thou art more knowing than I, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Moreover I beseech Thee, O God of the worlds, by the Most Great Name, to make me one of those who have arisen to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee in such wise that the might of the Pharaohs who violated Thy Covenant and turned away from Thy Beauty did not deter them. O Lord! Give me to drink the wine of steadfastness by Thy hand of bounty. Verily Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O ’Isa! Mention was made of two souls in the Most Holy Court - Isaac and Fath’u’llah. We make mention of them from this station as a token of Our grace. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We counsel them with that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. He, verily, is the Commander, the All-Informed. Blessed are they and those who have attained the recognition of God and have arisen to serve His Cause in such wise that neither the opposition of the divines nor the objections of rulers could deter them. Thy Lord, verily, is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>As commanded, His Holiness should consider whether it is suitable to send. O Zayn! We have commanded consultation, therefore We Ourselves consult. He, verily, is the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Concerning what was mentioned about Siyyid Khalil, His word, exalted be His grandeur: […]</p>
<p>All must engage in some occupation. He sendeth down blessings upon whomsoever He willeth. Thy Lord is verily the Generous, the Bountiful. All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>We make mention at the end of the Book of him who turned toward My direction by My leave, entered My prison, attained My presence, drank the choice wine of reunion with Me, and stood before the door of My grace and heard My call. He is indeed the one who hath been named “The Most Truthful” in My mighty Book.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant requests that you convey sincere greetings and glorification to all the friends in that land who have drunk from the ocean of recognition and are gazing toward the horizon of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Likewise to Aqa Sulayman who sent a letter to this servant - at the beginning it was a petition and at the end he made mention of this servant. At an appropriate time it was presented before His countenance and his entire supplication was laid before His presence. The answer was revealed from the heaven of will - His Holiness should write and send it. The new glad tidings are that once again his petition was presented and once again they showed favor.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God, before Whose greatness all things have testified and Whose might every knowing one hath acknowledged. He hath ever been and will ever be what He hath been. He revealeth in every time whatsoever He desireth. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the One, the Peerless.</p>
<p>After submitting the reply to two holy letters, a third letter dated the 19th of Shavval arrived.</p>
<p>Concerning what you had written that Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, had written from the land of Ta about Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God - this was presented to the Most Holy Court. They said: “Blessed is Muhammad who hath aimed at the Ultimate Goal and desired to serve his Lord, the Possessor of all beings. We make mention of him as a token of Our grace. He, verily, is the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing. And We glorify from this station him and those who have turned to the Qiblih of humanity. O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! The whole world hath been created for the service of the Cause. Whosoever hath turned thereunto hath attained to that which is intended. ‘The intention of the believer is better than his deed’ applieth to this station, inasmuch as he hath intended to turn toward the prison and engage in service to the Cause. This matter was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One because of Jinab-i-As, and He accepted the merit of his intention with utmost favor. This is the essence of the meaning of the blessed word previously mentioned. His service is accepted and his intention is approved. In these days, due to wisdom, his coming is not permitted, and afterward the matter is in His hand. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.”</p>
<p>And as for your mention of Ibn-i-Ismi-A?daq, upon both of them be the Glory of God, it was presented before the Most Holy Court. He - exalted be His grandeur - says: “He turned, by My leave, toward My Prison, and entered the seat of the Throne, and attained the presence of the Face, and heard the call of his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. We beseech God to assist him in serving His Cause and to grant him that which befits the days of his Lord, the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Informed. We have remembered him and do remember him as a token of Our grace, that he may rejoice in the loving-kindness of his Lord and be of the thankful ones. The Glory be upon his father who would present himself at the Gate every day and hear that which the Tongue of Grandeur would utter from His mighty and exalted station. We love to remember the Most Truthful One, for he has drunk the wine of My loving-kindness and attained My good-pleasure and spoke My praise and arose to serve My mighty Cause.”</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about the Tablet of ?adr, that the original revelation differs from the copy, meaning the word “this” appears in the copy but not in the original - the original revelation is correct and accurate. The copy this servant wrote should be made to match the original. This servant erroneously wrote “this.” They should make a copy from the original revelation text and provide both the original and the copy, as the person mentioned is not and was not capable of reading the original revelation.</p>
<p>And regarding the elegy composed by the wife of Aqa Mirza Abu-?alib, upon both of them be the Glory of God, which you had written about and sent - at one point the entire document was presented before the Most Holy Court. He - exalted be His grandeur - says: “Blessed is she, then blessed is she again, for having elegized a calamity for which the Tongue of Grandeur elegized and the dwellers of the pavilion of glory lamented.” O Zayn, convey congratulations to that leaf from the tongue of the Wronged One and give her the glad tidings that what she composed regarding the calamity of the Twin Luminous Lights was accepted before the Throne and attained the hearing of the Ancient Beauty. Her reward is with Him Who aided her and caused her to speak. He is the best rewarder. He is the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>We send greetings from this Most Exalted Station and Most Sublime Spot to the one whom We mentioned before and aided to recognize My Self and hear My verses - he who was named Abu-?alib in the Book of Names and was among those who remember. We sent him Tablets before, a single one of which cannot be equaled by all that hath been created on earth. Every discerning soul bears witness to this. Give him the glad tidings of My remembrance of him, then send him what We have revealed at this time. Say: Be not grieved at anything. Rejoice in the days of God and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made known to me Thy Day, which most of Thy servants have failed to recognize. O Lord! Aid me to preserve what Thou hast given me through Thy bounty, then cause me to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness in Thy Cause. Thou art the Generous. O Lord! Ordain through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit me in the Hereafter and in this world. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>And as for your fourth letter dated the 18th of Dhi’l-Qa’dah, it brought light to heart and soul. May the Beloved of all possibility ever assist you in that which is the cause of joy and gladness to His chosen ones and loved ones.</p>
<p>“This year, due to the war that has occurred and the conflicts that have arisen between monarchs, affairs in all lands have become difficult. However, after this hardship, ease will certainly appear. Verily, He provides for whomsoever He wishes without account. Travel to Aleppo is not approved, but if they wish to journey to the vicinity of Mosul, there is no objection.” End.</p>
<p>Another matter is that regarding the passages which His Holiness wrote concerning Aqa Muhammad-Baqir to Aqa Muhammad-Mu??afa, upon whom be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, the aforementioned personage sent a copy thereof to the Most Holy Court. Subsequently, by command, Haji Muhammad-Baqir and those with him, and Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-’Ali, upon them be the glory of God, were summoned and attained His presence, and afterwards they set out for Egypt. He stated that the friends in that land imagine that other places are better, that is to say, superior in terms of earning a livelihood and sustenance, but this has been and will continue to be an illusion. This year high prices are evident in all lands, especially in this land where goods have tripled in price and continued to rise, making the matter of livelihood difficult for everyone. However, God willing, through divine grace this will be transformed into ease.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Haji Ghulam-’Ali having verbally mentioned that the consort of His Holiness the Name 66 (may God sanctify his resting place) expressed great contentment and gratitude in the face of afflictions, and concerning what they mentioned about the wife of Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib (upon them be Baha’u’llah’s glory) having written in verse about being cast into a well - this incident did not actually occur and they were mistaken about this matter. They should not write about this. It is submitted that even if something did not occur, there would be no harm in mentioning it, given the cruelty of the oppressor who perpetrated this tyranny. Just as what was apparently said flowed from the Supreme Pen by way of questioning - consider the martyrdom of the Prince of Martyrs (may our souls be sacrificed for him). Whatever was mentioned and heard has been and continues to be proclaimed from pulpits, even though some of it may not have actually occurred. O beloved of my heart! By God, the oppressors cast her into a dark well. What well could be greater than this calamity that befell that leaf? What tyranny could be more tyrannical than what was visited upon her? The oppressors made her house a well for her. Her patience and fortitude, that leaf upon whom be the glory of God and His light and grace, are witnessed before the Throne. However, since His Holiness H has such a great station, nay the greatest station, before the Throne, even if this incident had occurred it would have caused no harm nor diminished the station of that leaf’s contentment, and she has a great station with her Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. O my beloved! The station of His Holiness H is most great. Always, due to the weakness of some, his station was veiled. May my spirit be sacrificed for him. Likewise the station of H and K who attained the greatest martyrdom - would that I had been with them and attained what they attained! Though Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Aqa Jan (upon him be the glory of God) still lives, he is counted among the martyrs for what great tribulations befell him. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist him in preserving what he has attained. What the wife of Aqa Siyyid Abu-Talib wrote is correct - let them not erase it. The Command is in His hands - He does what He wills and ordains what He desires. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Praise be to God that this petition ends with mention of these holy souls. I swear by the Ancient Beauty that the regret that this servant did not attain what they attained has been and will remain in my heart and soul. Today people are heedless - they know not what they say or do. Set aside the masses - even some of the beloved friends were seen to become disturbed and shaken by this great calamity, when at such times they should be the cause of assurance and steadfastness for others. I swear by the Sun of Revelation that a bounty has been bestowed the like of which has never been seen or heard of in creation. The request is that if possible, you yourself should convey what has been submitted to that pure leaf, with complete discretion and wisdom, as the Name S is very cautious regarding the opponents and polytheists.</p>
<p>Another submission is that his honor Ustad ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, wrote a letter to this servant. Its details were submitted to the Most Holy Court. The Sun of Providence has dawned. God willing, may they be immersed in the sea of contentment in all conditions and move upon the earth of His will. God’s providence has been with them and, God willing, will continue to be. Convey to them on behalf of this ephemeral one an exalted greeting. Their letter brought a smile to the face of the Desired One of the world. God willing, may they ever be confirmed and speak in remembrance of the Friend, arise in His service, move according to His will, turn toward His purpose, and be gladdened by His grace. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the All-Appreciating.</p>
<p>Regarding the sum of his honor Marfu’ which was submitted to the Most Holy Court, they have again commanded that in consideration of that elevated one’s station, nineteen qirans should be sent to the Most Holy Court and the remainder distributed among the loved ones of that land.</p>
<p>Another submission is that his honor Sadra from the land of Q, whose petition was previously forwarded, has been blessed with a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet specially revealed for him from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s mercy, and the original revelation was sent as submitted. Afterwards, this servant noticed that perhaps they might not be able to properly read it, therefore both the original and a copy were sent. God willing, may it reach them.</p>
<p>And another submission is that the reply to his honor Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], and some others will be sent next week, as it was not advisable to send all in one envelope. It is submitted again that the mention of sincerity and greetings on behalf of this ephemeral one to the divine friends is contingent upon your honor’s grace.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>Dated 26th of the month of Hajj, 1296</p>
<p>=== END BH00096 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00097 ===</p>
<p>May the esteemed and honored Mulla ’Abdu’r-Rahim take note: He is the Most Mighty, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious! Exalted be His grandeur and His majesty, then His power and His dominion, and transcendent be His station above the mention of them that make mention, above the description of them that describe, and above the praise of all the worlds.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant makes known that your letter was received, and from the wondrous words and the pearls of meaning concealed within the shells of its letters was unveiled. And in these days when the joy of creation appears to have been lifted and the tyranny and oppression of those who oppose the Beauty of the King of Names and Attributes has encompassed the world, utmost joy and delight was attained. For you had inquired about certain doubts that the people of uncertainty have brought against the Cause of the King of Oneness. Although today it is not permissible for any soul to gaze upon aught but the Truth, lest doubt and intimation deprive him from the holy and eternal presence, yet since the Ancient Beauty has loved and continues to love those who ask, therefore joy appeared and delight was manifested. Otherwise, I swear by the Beloved of all, such sorrows have in this day befallen the Beauty of the All-Merciful that all things are engaged in lamentation and weeping. For in every age, every oppressor who committed oppression acknowledged his own deed and tyranny and made no claim of being oppressed. But the oppressors of this age - though by God besides Whom there is no God they have intended to slay the Divine Tree - have attributed Sunnism to it before the Persians of this land, and likewise attributed Shi’ism and heterodoxy before the Sunnis. Nevertheless they have written letters to all regions and attributed all these oppressive acts to the Self of God Who stands for justice. Consider now how much harm has been inflicted, for they have deemed the people foolish and assumed them to be without understanding, thinking they could thereby conceal this holy and eternal Revelation through such words. They are heedless that God has servants who consider hundreds of thousands like these as non-existent and hasten to the holy and praiseworthy court. Nothing affects their hearts save the word of truth, and naught passes over their sanctified hearts save the divine fragrances. And as to what you wrote regarding the truth and authenticity of the Most Great Beauty, exalted be His station, being as clear as the mid-day sun, while there is discussion about the falsity of others who are known - this servant submits that if the authenticity of the Truth, exalted be His glory, is evident and clear as you have written, then any soul who rejects the Truth is assuredly rejected and will remain so, whether they be of the Most Great Name or otherwise. And after truth there is naught but manifest error. And if certain persons have not recognized His authenticity and His truth has not been proven to them, we ask: are these souls responsible or not? If they are not responsible, no blame rests upon them. And if they are responsible, has the hand of the invisible divine power deposited within these souls a sign for recognizing His own Self or not? If He has not deposited it while commanding recognition - God forbid! For no oppressor has ever commanded beyond capacity, nor will ever do so - how much less the Essence of mercy and the Source of grace. And if He has deposited it, then these souls must themselves understand the Cause of Truth. In this case, neither the rejection of anyone nor the acceptance of any soul would suffice these souls, for within these souls was the sign of divine recognition whereby they could know the Truth and distinguish it from all else. Once this station is established, one must today seek from the Manifestation Himself that same proof by which the Cause of the Primal Point, exalted be His station, was established. Without this, nothing will avail or benefit, now or ever.</p>
<p>It is most clear that the Primal Point, exalted be His grandeur, made no mention except of the Letters of the Unity and the Mirrors. He designated the Letters of Unity as the fourteen returned proofs of the Qur’an and the other four from the four gates, and named these souls the Letters of the Living, giving them precedence over all who are in the Bayan. After this rank, He mentioned the Mirrors. Observe that in none of the Tablets did He set a limit to the Mirrors, as He states that if infinite mirrors were to face each other, the light of the sun would be reflected and manifest in all of them, and after their turning away, He states, that bounty is withdrawn. He gave the example of the visible mirror and the visible sun, stating that whosoever wishes to understand should observe the visible sun and the visible mirrors. He removed all Qur’anic limitations, such that it became clear to all who had vision that these people had nothing of truth in their hands, and whatever they had was contrary to it. Now I shall present some matters to you so that, God willing, you may act with insight. For instance, first, if anyone claimed that the Qa’im must be born, they considered such a person an infidel and deemed his execution necessary and obligatory. Second, His existence in Jabulqa and Jabulsa, and likewise they rejected anyone who denied this belief. Third, similarly regarding the seal of prophethood, they firmly held that absolutely no one would ever come after, and if anyone believed that a Manifestation would come, they considered him an infidel, rejected, and among the people of the fire. Fourth, what they mentioned regarding the resurrection, considering its deniers as infidels. Fifth, the mention of the vision of God, considering those who affirmed it as infidels. Sixth, the mention of the bridge, about which they held such vain beliefs. Seventh, the mention of resurrection, wherein they all believed that decayed bones must rise from literal graves, and they considered [its deniers] as infidels, and similar matters that they held. You observe that in none of these sayings were these people truthful. There is no doubt that you yourself confirm that they all spoke of these things unknowingly, as it became clear in the Manifestation of the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, that all they held was contrary to God’s Cause, as if these people had not a single truth in their possession, for they mentioned all these matters unknowingly while considering them true and [their denier] as rejected. Now you yourself confirm that they had not understood any of these matters.</p>
<p>And [its deniers] have rejected it. Now you yourself acknowledge that you had not understood any of these matters, and what they were saying was pure falsehood and sheer calumny. Similarly, compare the rest of the statements of this group to the aforementioned matters and keep the heart pure and sanctified from all things. Although today the leaders of the Bayan have cast people into such delusions that, I swear by the Truth, no nations among the nations of the past have ever been tainted by such delusions. And they are now occupied with proofs that even the lowliest among the people of the Furqan (Qur’an) had used as evidence, and they pride themselves on this, hoping that through these imaginary utterances they might deprive the people of the Chosen Beauty.</p>
<p>As to the questions mentioned by that honored one: First, you had written that when we observe the world of creation, we notice that gold and ruby may become corrupted before reaching their state of perfection, but after reaching maturity this is not possible. Yes, such questions have been asked and answers have descended from the Most Exalted Pen - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for it. Search and perhaps you will find it, for it suffices for all the world. In any case, it should be known to that honored one that regarding the nature of gold and ruby, who has not had knowledge of it, and the essential nature of gold is not known. Even if we accept this, first we say that this inability exists in contingent beings, but God has power over all things. He transforms whatever He wills - if He wishes to turn all the gold of the world into copper, He is able and empowered. And if He wills, He creates the possibility of change in all things by His command, then changes it by His sovereignty, for He is the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Moreover, gold does turn into copper, as the Pen of God has written, and they have said that whoever denies this should come into the presence and observe it. Beyond this, philosophers have stated that when gold remains in soil for a time, it turns to soil. And even without the words of philosophers, there is the Word of God which states “I created all from dust and to dust shall I return them.” Therefore it is established that gold turns to dust, and dust is clearly baser than copper. Likewise ruby, when placed in fire, becomes like ashes. Consider the heart of the believer like a ruby - this ruby-like quality holds true for it as long as the fire of rejection does not touch it, but after encountering that fire it surely turns to ashes. This is clear to anyone with vision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one is aware of divine wisdom to understand what it requires or does not require. Whatever matter appears from His sacred presence is itself the decree that required it to appear. If it was not required, it would not have appeared. Therefore look to the decree itself that has become manifest, rather than imagining in vain that such-and-such does not accord with wisdom.</p>
<p>You had also written, and this is its form: “As for religious law, after reaching forty years which is true Islam, it is against wisdom for a believer to turn back or become veiled - what do you say about this?” Consider those believers who were present at the beginning of this wondrous Revelation - they were all among the clergy whose obedience you considered obligatory and deemed obedience to God. What happened that suddenly the decree of unbelief was applied to all except those souls who believed and acknowledged the truth, even if they were among the lowliest of servants? As was observed, those who were not known for scholarship and whom no one paid attention to - when they attained faith in the truth, verses of purification and infallibility were revealed concerning them and they were counted among the Prophets and saints in God’s presence. And regarding infallibility, the Primal Point, exalted and glorified be He, hath declared that whosoever believeth in Him is infallible, and whosoever believeth not is bereft of infallibility. He hath further declared that infallibility is not what the followers of the Qur’an have imagined, who have regarded religious precautions as infallibility. Rather, infallibility belongeth to him who, at the time of the Manifestation, believeth in God, even though he be accounted among the lowliest of creation. Therefore, turn your gaze away from these considerations and fix your eyes upon God and that which proceedeth from His presence, that ye may behold yourselves sanctified from all such questions and doubts.</p>
<p>And furthermore you wrote concerning a tradition that says a Sunni can become Shi’ih but a Shi’ih cannot become Sunni. This is merely a vain imagination that existed among the people of the Furqan. You must surely purify your heart from such utterances. Have you not observed that the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all within the heaven of might be His sacrifice - states in the Persian Bayan that oftentimes the Tree of Affirmation is considered as the Tree of Negation at the time of the next Manifestation, and likewise Negation becomes Affirmation. Reflect upon this Persian passage so that you may comprehend all the divine mysteries. The Sunnis at least believe the Qa’im must be born, but those whom you call Muslims - their divines have not even grasped this much. Consider how all the Shi’ih divines did not understand even as much as a single Sunni divine, as evidenced by Muhyi’d-Din, who was among the Sunni mystics and explicitly foretold His Holiness’s birth in Persia, saying “A male child will be born in Persia.” He explicitly mentioned the appearance, birth and blessed name, as His Holiness the Exalted One - may our spirits be sacrificed for His sake - Himself cited these words as proof. Yet the Shi’ih divines were heedless of all these matters and even considered believers to be infidels. What these divines perpetrated was something that neither Jews nor Christians would do, let alone Sunnis - they suspended that Temple of the Divine Purpose in the air and martyred Him with utmost tyranny. The curse of God be upon the oppressors! And if even one Shi’ih became aware of two words of truth, they excommunicated him and issued a death sentence against him, as happened with Shalmaghani who explicitly made mention and whose words the Primal Point - may the spirit of all in the kingdom be His sacrifice - quoted and cited as evidence in His own Cause: “O seeker from the Hashimite house and denier from the Khusrawi house, He has disappeared in relation to the Persian lineage in the noble Persian descent.” Now observe how he mentioned His birth, His appearance from Persia, as well as His appearance from the line of Rida. Nevertheless they excommunicated him and ordered his execution until he was killed, as you all know, and even now they continue to curse him. Such is the condition of these people. Therefore it is a pity for one to recall what is in the possession of this sect. Now regarding what is mentioned, observe for yourself whether it is truth or spoken from desire. Thus it is that at the time of every Manifestation, all on earth stand equal before God. Whoever from any group believes becomes counted before God among the people of faith, affirmation and the exalted ones. And whoever does not attain to faith is and will be reckoned among the people of denial, the debased, the rejectors and negation. For example, today as the Supreme Lord - may the spirit of all else be His sacrifice - says to Aqa Siyyid Yahya: “If I knew that on the Day of the next Manifestation you would not believe, I would today pass the judgment of unbelief regarding you. And if I knew that one of the Christians would believe in Him, I would surely make him the apple of Mine eye this day and would pronounce the decree of faith concerning him. Therefore, on this Day turn your gaze away from all else but God and fix it upon the Manifestation Himself. Whosoever believeth in Him, count him among the people of truth, affirmation and faith, even though he be of the lowliest in the Bayan; and whosoever believeth not in Him, reckon him among the people of negation and hell-fire, even though he be of the most exalted in the Bayan. This is the truth, and after truth there is naught but error. What benefit is there in mentioning aught but truth, or in the sayings of people - what this sect sayeth or hath said? Leave these mentions to themselves and strive to be counted among those companions mentioned in the Best of Stories, where He, exalted be His remembrance, saith:”Verily God hath created around that Gate seas of crimson elixir, and animals bearing the desired fruit, and He hath ordained for it ships of moist red ruby wherein none shall embark save the people of Baha, by God’s leave, the Most High; and He is God, the Mighty, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>This is what the Primal Point - may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake - hath announced. How blessed, then, are they who are established in this most glorious and ancient Ship, who traverse the crimson sea and witness the manifestations of glory, the signs of oneness, the conclusive decree, and the gems of divine craftsmanship. Furthermore, that honored one should reflect and ponder whether the like of this Most Great Revelation hath ever appeared in creation […] and was recorded among the polytheists in God’s tablets by the Most Holy Pen.</p>
<p>And further, you mentioned that the shepherd of the flock must be trustworthy. This hath been revealed by the Pen of God, and you shall, God willing, attain unto its presence. For a thousand years the shepherds of the flock have all been wolves, as became evident in the year sixty. This is the meaning of “the Day when the secrets are tried.” Now say, why did God leave the people in the hands of wolves? If you say these wolves were not wolves until the time of the Manifestation, and only became wolves when they turned away from the Truth, then apply the same principle now. The Manifestation is manifest, and all who turn away are accounted as wolves in God’s sight. In any case, O my master, cleanse the ear of thy heart and the eye of thy inner vision from all these veils and clouds, and know the Truth as One Who doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, for whosoever submitteth to this all-embracing Word will raise no objection to the Sovereign of Creation in any matter. After the presentation of the conclusive proof, whatsoever He ordaineth is and shall ever be the truth.</p>
<p>You who make mention of God! What you have mentioned about certain people who say that in the blessed Epistle of the Uncle, written by the All-Bountiful Pen, Quranic verses are cited as proofs, and from this they conclude that the way of God has not changed - glory be to God! It is astonishing that they have not grasped this obvious matter. First, verses from God’s wondrous new revelation that descended from the Most Glorious Tongue, exalted be His grandeur and power, are recorded in that epistle. Second, it is quite clear that one must speak according to the capacity of the listeners. That epistle was written because some relatives of the Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for all except Him, had doubts about certain matters and had not yet advanced from the Quran to the Bayan. Therefore, for the people of the Quran, Quranic verses were used as proof lest they become disturbed, as they did not yet accept the Bayan and thus could not be shown verses from the wondrous Bayan. Otherwise, for those who drink from the cup of eternity, no proofs are or will be used except the most wondrous and glorious verses, whether from His previous or subsequent Manifestation. Whatever is mentioned is in consideration of the weakness of the servants. And God is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>In any case, today you should act according to what has flowed from the Divine Pen in the Persian Bayan. As for what remains suspended in the heaven of God’s will, whoever needs clarification should ask the Source of grace and bounty so that an answer may be revealed. Although the deniers have written what they claim to be the completion of the Persian Bayan, they are unaware that they have committed a grave error, for this right belongs exclusively to the Manifestation of Truth Himself, and not to anyone else. If one reflects, their status is clear from their own words. Despite the fact that the Point of the Bayan, exalted and mighty is He, explicitly stated that no one should write laws or make the slightest change except the next Manifestation, who does what He wills, they have nevertheless recorded fabricated laws. God will never accept from them. Say: O servants! Detach yourselves from all save God, turn your gaze toward God, return unto God, journey in God, act for God, be martyred in God’s path, and draw breath in His good-pleasure. This is the petition of this servant to his Master.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that the Most Glorious Beauty, may our souls be sacrificed for all except Him, would partake of coffee and smoke the water pipe. Yes, in Baghdad, as you wrote, He would go to coffeehouses and partake of coffee and the water pipe, but this was to preserve the Bayan and its people. Beyond this, do not think ill of your Lord, for the Blessed Being has always been and will always be sanctified. Although whatever He does is permissible, you may ask those who entered the House of God in Iraq and attained His presence, so that you may become aware of His absolute sanctification, pure detachment, and supreme purification.</p>
<p>The Hour hath drawn nigh and the moon hath been cleft in twain – concerning this blessed verse which you mentioned, stating that you had pondered its numerical value and found it did not correspond: it doth indeed correspond with this divine and eternal Manifestation. You were not and are not aware of the time of its appearance. Reflect, that you may understand. Moreover, set aside the numbers and fix your gaze upon the verse itself – how clearly it foretelleth the reality of this Revelation, saying that the Hour drew nigh and the moon was cleft asunder. In all the holy Books, the moon hath been interpreted to mean the Vicegerent, the sun to mean the Prophet, and the stars to mean the deputies and divines. In the previous Revelation, which was the year sixty, there was, according to the people’s belief, no Vicegerent who could be cleft asunder, for in that year there were only divines. Consider now how in this most great Revelation the Sun did shine forth and the supposed Vicegerent, according to the people’s belief, was cleft asunder. Say: Blessed then be God, the most powerful of the powerful!</p>
<p>If you would but ponder this single verse, it would suffice for you and all who are within the Bayan. Furthermore, let them not suppose that the Ancient Beauty, exalted be His glory, hath ever rejected or objected to anyone. Nay, by Him Who holdeth all existence in the grasp of His power! Rather, they have regarded those who turned away from this manifest Beauty as infidels and idolaters. Now, whosoever doth not deny the Primal Point in the garment of the Most Glorious, and acknowledgeth Him, is accounted before God among the people of eternity, even should he be the lowliest of men. And whosoever turneth away is recorded before God among the people of extinction, even should he be among the most exalted of creation.</p>
<p>However, regarding that known individual, he openly objected to the Truth and, by God besides Whom there is none other God, arose to slay the Divine Tree. How then could such a one be accounted before God among the people of affirmation? Assuredly such a person was among the people of fire and negation and the nethermost depths, and all the world’s evil shall be attributed to him. By God, the people are lost in mere fancy! Would that you could see and become aware of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake, that whatsoever He possesseth is through the grace of the Most Glorious Beauty, may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for Him. Even now, such innate qualities and spiritual signs are manifest from the servants at His threshold that others bear no comparison to them whatsoever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning the verse about the brightening of faces, it was the eightieth year of the Manifestation, which first dawned in the year nine, and after eighty years they appeared in full manifestation, might and power, as you have heard. The seven years thereafter are the years of hardship, as mentioned in the Tablets of God. And in the eighty-eighth year, the faces of those made bright, purely for God’s sake and detached from all else but Him, and triumphant over God’s enemies, shall become evident. Therefore, strive that you may be counted, God willing, among these souls. Although some holy souls have already appeared whose facial radiance hath illumined the countenances of the dwellers of the heavens – blessed are they that perceive!</p>
<p>Once again, at the end, it has occurred to this servant to submit mention of those souls who, at the beginning of the Bayan, believed with perfect faith in the Beauty of the All-Merciful, yet after the passing of a year or two years or more or less became deniers and arose in utmost opposition. Although this matter was mentioned before, there is no harm in repeating any subject, as it has been and will be the cause of steadfastness for the believers. Therefore it is submitted that among the early believers was Khar Valiyani, who was the first to believe and for about a year or more would mount pulpits to promote the Cause and prove its truth, presenting proofs of the truth of Truth, yet afterwards became such an opposer that he issued death sentences against all pure souls. And there were many like him, including Mulla Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Haravi, Mulla ’Abdu’l-’Ali, Mirza Ibrahim-i-Shirazi and others who were all believers but became deniers after a year or two. Apart from these, have you not heard the stories of old, as has now flowed from the Pen of God, about Balaam who was one of the saints and successors of his age whom all the world considered it obligatory to mention, yet when the Interlocutor appeared from the dawning-place of the Cause, he objected to Him and was counted among the idolators? Likewise Judas Iscariot who was one of the twelve apostles of the Gospel yet delivered Jesus Himself to the Jews, as is recorded in detail in the original Book. And besides these, Satan who was the teacher of the Kingdom in the heavens and was known in each heaven by one of the most beautiful names, yet in the end through one act of pride was counted among the wicked and numbered with the infidels. In any case, you should reflect on these matters and not be heedless of the truth due to such vain words. Furthermore, observe in the book of proofs of Shaykh Kazim, who drank from the cup of immortality from holy fingers and was recorded by the Pen of God in the tablets of glory as being among the people of Baha, that at the beginning of the tablet he presents as proof this blessed verse revealed from the most exalted holy tongue, His word exalted be His mention: “Say: O God! Thou art the God of Gods! Thou givest divinity to whom Thou willest and takest it from whom Thou willest” to the end of His utterance, exalted be His mention. Then after that His word exalted be His mention: “Say: O God! Thou art the Lord of the heavens and earth” to the end of that verse. After stating that divinity and lordship are bestowed on whomever He wishes and taken from whomever He wishes, still you doubt that a believer can become an infidel and that a ruby can change. All these degrees are in the grasp of God’s Will - He bestows whenever He wishes and takes away whenever He wishes, and He shall not be questioned about what He does. In any case, purify your heart from these stations and look to that which is evident as the sun in the midst of heaven. And these answers that I have submitted are so that you may convey them to the people lest they slip from the straight path due to such doubts. God willing, you must at all times be occupied with promoting the manifest Cause.</p>
<p>And these answers which I have submitted are intended so that you may convey to the people lest they slip from the straight path due to such doubts. You must, God willing, be engaged at all times in teaching the Manifest Cause, detached from all who are in the heavens and earth, for I have witnessed countless divine favors bestowed upon you in these days, as evidenced in the noble Tablet specifically revealed for you from the heaven of holiness, and likewise in another Tablet being sent at this time. We hope that after reading it, you will arise with all your heart and soul to serve God in such wise that you may wholly purify your heart from all else but Him and sanctify your tongue from mention of aught save Him. And God willing, you shall thereafter become the recipient of special favors from God, if you remain steadfast in your Lord’s Cause and be of the firm ones. And the Glory be upon you and upon those with you among God’s assured servants.</p>
<p>He is God</p>
<p>Regarding what was previously mentioned about the ruby, it has become necessary to explain it in detail. In rubies various types and different colors are observed. All of its colors are altered in fire and its freshness and delicacy are lost, except for the pomegranate-colored and the crimson types - these two, if they encounter mild fire from behind a veil, their color somewhat increases […] But if it encounters the fire that is known among the philosophers, it will certainly change, and if it touches the fire known in natural craft as red sulfur, it will immediately calcify just as gold, silver, copper and other metallic bodies are calcified through various medicines. Thus have I mentioned this for you that you may become informed and be of those who are informed. And beyond this, verily your Lord has power over all things, and it behooveth no one to doubt God’s power. This indeed is the truth, and after truth there is naught but error. Praise be to God, the Lord of grandeur and majesty. And say at the end: O God! Curse the first oppressor who oppressed the Primal Point in His latter Manifestation, who denied His signs, who fought against His Self, who disputed His sovereignty, who associated partners with His Being, who denied His words, who turned away from His beauty, and who was recorded among the polytheists in God’s tablets by the Most Holy Pen. The Servant of God and His slave, Aqa Jan</p>

<p>He is the One Who gazeth from His Most Exalted Horizon</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is verily the Dayspring of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs. Through Him were the Books sent down and that which was recorded in the Mother Book was made manifest. O thou who hast turned toward My horizon, hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison. There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Say: By God! He Who was recorded in God’s Books and concealed in His knowledge hath come. Come ye, O peoples of the earth, that ye may hear what the Ear of Moses heard on the Sinai of Divine Utterance. Say: Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Rend ye asunder the veils of idle fancies in the name of your Lord, the Lord of all mankind. This is the Day whereon all things proclaim: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>There hath come before the Wronged One a letter from him who hath arisen to serve My Cause, who hath voiced My praise, who hath drunk the choice wine of My love from the hand of My bounty, who hath attained My presence and stood before the door of My grandeur, and hath heard My sweetest call, wherein was thy mention. We make mention of thee with a remembrance whose fragrance shall not cease to endure so long as the names of thy Lord, the Lord of the Return, shall endure. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to turn unto Him and guided thee unto the straight path. We counsel thee and them that have believed to wisdom and utterance, lest the clamour of them that have turned away and disbelieved in God, the Powerful, the All-Choosing, be raised. Blessed art thou for having turned toward My horizon and blessed is thy house which thou hast made a dawning-place of remembrance.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy brother who hath ascended unto the Supreme Companion and was named Muhammad-’Ali. We testify that he hearkened unto the Call and attained unto the days of his Lord, the Lord of all men. We have forgiven him and purified him and make mention of him in this Tablet from whose horizon shineth forth the Day-Star of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all names. We make mention of him and of that which befell thee in the path of God. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Be thou steadfast in the service of the Cause, and circle round the Will, and hold fast unto the cord of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious. The splendor shining forth from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon thy sister and upon those women who have turned unto God and believed in Him Who revealeth the verses.</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad-Sadiq and ’Abdu’l-Karim and Haydar and him who was named Abu’l-Qasim and give them glad tidings of the bounties of their Lord Who hath come with power and sovereignty. We counsel them to observe the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped save those whom God hath delivered as a grace from Him, and He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. From this station We send Our greetings upon their faces and beseech God to aid them in His remembrance and praise and in serving His Cause which hath illumined the horizons.</p>
<p>We make mention of the Siyyid who was named ’Ali-Rida that he may rejoice and be of them that render thanks. Blessed art thou for having turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon when mankind turned away from it, and for having heard the Call when it was raised betwixt earth and heaven. We counsel thee to steadfastness from this Most Exalted Station. Thy Lord is, in truth, the Counselor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! Rejoice thou that the countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee and hath mentioned thee with verses which God hath made the standards of His victory amidst His servants and the emblems of His might unto all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O youth Rida! Take what We have sent unto thee with power from God, the Lord of the worlds, and cast away what the people possess, for they are recorded among the most lost in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech God to aid thee in serving His Cause and to draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. He is verily the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ghulam-Husayn and give him glad tidings through My remembrance of him. By the life of God! That which is with men cannot equal this. I am the All-Seeing Witness. Rejoice in this bounty and give thanks to thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beauteous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! We have manifested the Cause and revealed the verses, yet most of mankind remain heedless. Among men are those who turned toward God when they heard His call, and those who turned away when the clamor was raised. Blessed is the servant who hath clung to the hem of God’s robe and turned to Him with a radiant face, and hath arisen to serve the Cause in such wise that neither the clamor of the divines nor the doubts of the followers of the Bayan, who have broken the Covenant and denied Him in Whom they had believed, could deter him. They are indeed the distracted ones. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and give thanks for that which He hath revealed unto thee, which all that hath been created on earth cannot equal. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning soul.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn and Muhammad-Rafi’! Rejoice that My Most Exalted Pen hath turned towards you and made mention of you in such wise as shall endure throughout the kingdom. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless. We make mention of you and counsel you to practice righteousness and piety, and that whereby the Cause of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise, may be exalted. O My Most Exalted Pen! At all times do We hear thy scratching and thy call in remembrance of God and His loved ones. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who findeth solace in that which floweth from thee by God’s command, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Make mention on My behalf of him who was named ’Ali-’Askar and give him the glad tidings of My turning towards him and My remembrance of him in this mighty Prison. Give thanks unto God Who created thee, nurtured thee, and made mention of thee in such wise as nothing on earth can equal. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Then make mention of Hasan with that which God hath inspired thee, that he may rejoice and be of those who render thanks. O Hasan! Thy Lord maketh mention of thee even as He mentioned His loved ones before thee. He verily doth not withhold the reward of the righteous.</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Husayn! The Wronged One calleth thee from the Most Great Prison with that which shall draw thee to the horizon of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Beware lest Satan’s hosts prevent thee from thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Abandon what the people possess, clinging to the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Ancient Commander. Take hold of God’s Book with the power that proceedeth from Him, and give thanks at all times.</p>
<p>O Tongue of My Grandeur! Make mention from My Kingdom of My servants Muhammad-’Ali, ’Abdu’r-Rahim, and Muhammad-Isma’il, who have been remembered by him who circumambulated My Cause and arose to serve Me. I am the All-Knowing Witness. Blessed are ye for having turned unto God and attained unto His Word that speaketh before the faces of all the world: “There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.” Recognize the station of this most exalted Station and say:</p>
<p>“Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having enabled us to remember and praise Thee, and for having drawn us nigh unto Thee. We beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance and the splendors of the sun of Thy bounty to aid us to remain steadfast in that which Thou hast graciously bestowed upon us. Verily Thou art the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Karim! Give thanks unto God Who hath adorned thy head with the crown of acceptance and made thee recognize Him from Whom most of mankind remain veiled. He is the Protector of those who have turned unto Him. We observed thy turning to Us and We turned unto thee, and having perceived the fragrance of thy love, We made mention of thee in My wondrous utterance. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Rejoice in My remembrance of thee and preserve this station through this Name that holdeth sway over all who are in the heavens and on earth. Beware lest anything hold thee back from God. Leave the people and what they possess, turning unto the One, the All-Informed. Thus hath there flowed from My Most Exalted Pen the Living Waters. Blessed is he who hath taken and drunk thereof, and woe unto those who have forsaken it.</p>
<p>O Tongue of the Will! We love to make mention of him who writes the verses of thy Lord and who is named Muhammad Hashim, with a mention at whose appearance all mention bows down in adoration. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance and attainest unto My verses which have descended from My Kingdom, arise and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the world, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Possessor of all names! I testify that through Thee the Hidden Name and the Treasured Secret, which had been concealed from all eyes throughout all eternity, was revealed. Through Thee were the mysteries of the Books unveiled and the standards of “Verily Thou art God” were hoisted upon the highest pennants. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Sovereign of the seen and unseen, by the lights of Thy countenance and the manifestations of Thy sovereignty, to assist me under all conditions to be steadfast in this Cause whereby the mountains have been shaken.</p>
<p>Then, O My Tongue, make mention of him who is named by His name, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Possessor of all beings. We counsel him and Our loved ones to be trustworthy, religious, truthful and faithful, and to manifest that which will exalt the station of man in the contingent world. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned by My Most Exalted Pen and for having attained unto that which was hidden from all eyes. O Muhammad Hashim! Hearken unto the call from the direction of Akka: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. We have sent the Messengers and revealed the Books as a grace from Our presence, and verily I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have mentioned thee before and at this time. Rejoice in the bounty of thy Lord, through Whom earthquakes have seized most lands save those who held fast to the cord of God, the Lord of all beings. Limit thine affairs to the service of thy Lord. Soon will all on earth perish, and there shall remain for thee what hath been revealed from My Most Exalted Pen, and I am the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Pen! Arise to serve the Cause of the Lord of Eternity, then make mention from the direction of My Most Luminous Horizon of My servant who is named Ali-Qabl-Akbar (Ustad), who hath arisen to serve My Cause and hath spoken My praise and hath attained unto My Tablets and hath acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered in My Kingdom, and I am the True Speaker, the Trustworthy. O Ali-Qabl-Akbar! The Wronged One hath mentioned thee once in the Most Great Prison and again in the palace built by the hands of providence, wherein My Temple was established upon the throne of My Great Name. Blessed art thou in that God hath assisted thee to serve His Cause and thou hast been mentioned by him who hath loved Me and hath arisen to assist My wondrous Cause. We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee, and We have seen thy turning towards Us and have called out to thee from the right side of the Mount with that which the fragrance thereof shall never cease to endure throughout the eternity of the name of thy Ancient Lord. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon thy brothers who have tasted the sweetness of My call and have drunk the choice wine of My love, and upon every patient, steadfast and upright one.</p>
<p>And We make mention in this station of him who is named Muhammad, that the mention of his Lord may draw him to a station wherein he shall behold none save God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. O Muhammad! Blessed art thou and blessed are they who have shattered the idols of vain imaginings and adorned their temples with the lights of certitude. We make mention of them that have believed in God throughout the nights and days. To this testifieth every fair-minded and knowing one. Let not the affairs of earth grieve thee. Leave them behind thee, turning unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgement. There hath befallen Us at the hands of the hostile forces that which hath caused the clouds to wail and the Faithful Spirit to lament. Once they imprisoned Us in the land of Ta, and when the appointed time was fulfilled, they expelled Us therefrom. We journeyed until the land of Zawra was honoured by the advent of thy Lord, the Lord of all worlds. Then did they banish Us from there until We entered the Great City, and from thence to the Land of Mystery, and from there to this Great Prison. Thereafter the matter resteth in His hands. He knoweth and is patient. Were We to recount what lay in the hearts of the enemies and what they intended, the bereaved would weep and wail. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the Rememberer, the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>O My Pen! The Lord of Eternity commandeth thee to make mention of His loved ones and His friends, from whose countenances shineth the radiance of the All-Merciful and from whose character is manifested that whereby the Cause of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, is exalted. O ’Ali-Akbar! We counsel thee to act in accordance with what God hath revealed in His Book. Thy Lord, verily, is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. He hath created the world for My days, yet most of the people comprehend not. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to what proceedeth from the daysprings of idle fancies - they who have denied the signs of God and disputed them, and turned away from the Face when it shone forth from this Horizon which God hath made the Dawning-place of Light.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Qasim, who turned unto his Lord and answered His call when the summons was raised. We beseech God to aid him to remain steadfast in this irrevocable Cause. O Qasim! Thy Lord calleth thee from beyond the sea and maketh mention of thee with that which nothing visible can equal. Rejoice thou and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen! Blessed is he who hath attained unto the mention of God in His days. He is indeed among the most exalted of creatures in a preserved Tablet. Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and say:</p>
<p>I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the stars of the heaven of Thy bounty and the effulgent rays of the Sun of Thy countenance, to make me steadfast in this Cause whereby hearts and souls have been shaken.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida! We have sent down the verses and manifested the Cause, yet most of the people perceive not. Say: He walketh not in your ways, nor followeth what ye possess. He hath appeared with the truth and His is the sure handle and the extended path. It behoveth every soul to hold fast unto it. His is the command, both before and after. There is no God but Him, the Almighty, the Sovereign over what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! Take thou this perspicuous Book with a power from Our presence. Beware lest the affairs of men debar thee from the truth. Cast away what the people possess and take what thou art commanded by God, the Lord of existence. Thus have the spheres of utterance been set in motion by thy Lord’s will, the Lord of all names, yet most people understand not. They have turned away from the truth, inclining unto the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Rida, who turned towards the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is he and his brother who turned towards the Countenance and drank the choice wine of utterance from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for thee that which guideth the servants unto the Interlocutor of the Mount. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast mentioned me in Thy Most Great Prison and guided me unto Thy praised station.” Blessed is thy house wherein the mention of God hath been raised. We, from this station, magnify thee and thy brother, and give you both glad tidings of the mercy that hath preceded existence. The Glory, manifest and resplendent from the horizon of My loving-kindness, be upon you both and upon those who have drunk, in My Self-Subsisting Name, of My sealed choice wine. We make mention of your father who was enkindled with the fire of the love of God and who spoke in praise of his Lord. Verily, he is of the people of this station in a preserved Tablet. By the life of God! Nothing in the world can equal this mention, yet most of the people understand not. O Muhammad-Rida! Confine thyself to the promotion of the Cause of thy Lord and His mention amongst His servants. Soon shall the world and whatsoever is therein perish, and there shall endure every deed that hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Beware lest the might of princes frighten thee or the veils of the divines who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, and have denied the verses when they were sent down from the heaven of the will of thy Lord, the Sovereign of the Kingdom, prevent thee.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee from the precincts of the Prison, and calleth thee to patience and resignation in this Cause whereby the foundations of every rejected idolater have been shaken. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the clamor of the people. Verily thy Lord hath made mention of thee and guided thee unto His outstretched path. There hath befallen thee what hath befallen Us, as attesteth He with Whom is the hidden Book. Hold thou fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having created me and reared me and mentioned me in Thy praised station. I beseech Thee, by the fragrances of Thy Revelation and the lights of Thy Countenance, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause. Thou art, verily, the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all kings.”</p>
<p>O Ghulam-Qabli-Rida! There hath dawned from the horizon of My Most Glorious Name that which the earth and heaven cannot equal, as attesteth He with Whom is the Mother Book. Blessed is he who hath spoken My mention and attained unto My praise and risen to serve My Cause whereby necks have been subdued. This is a Day wherein that which was hidden in the knowledge of God and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets hath been made manifest. Know thou this most exalted station. He hath mentioned thee in such wise as shall endure in the kingdom through the perpetuity of My Name, the Dominator over all names.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabli-Rida! We have seen thy turning unto Us and We have turned unto thee, and We have heard thy call and answered thee with verses at whose revelation all verses have bowed down in submission. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to turn towards Him and for having mentioned thee from the horizon wherefrom the lights have shone forth. Be thou steadfast in the service of the Cause and speak forth His praise throughout the nights and days.</p>
<p>O Abbas! The Lord of humanity remembers you and calls you to the lamp kindled by the hand of power among creation. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. He does whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Whosoever saith ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ hath disbelieved in God, the Lord of all lords. We had informed everyone of the rising of the clamor in all regions when the Light was shining from the horizon of Iraq and in the Land of Mystery and in this Station which hath been named with the most beautiful names by God, the Lord of creation. We beseech God to protect you and His loved ones from the evil of those who outwardly claim to love God and follow Him while calling people to themselves - and the call of such atheists is naught but error.</p>
<p>O Hadi! He Who guided thee to the straight path makes mention of thee and imparts unto thee that which shall cause thy remembrance to endure throughout the eternity of thy Lord’s names, the Lord of all beings. Verily he who hath arisen to serve the Cause is of the people of Baha in the Book of Names and among the companions of the Crimson Ark in the scriptures and tablets. Hold fast unto the cord of certitude in such wise that none in all creation may deter thee. Be thankful to thy Lord Who remembered thee and aided thee until thou didst turn toward His supreme horizon while most of the servants turned away. Be vocal in thy Lord’s praise and steadfast in His remembrance throughout the nights and days. Thus have We adorned thy temple with the ornament of thy Lord’s remembrance, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Abul-Qasim! The Lord of the world makes mention of thee from the Most Great Prison that He may draw thee nigh unto the horizon whence shone forth the lights of thy Lord’s countenance, the Cleaver of the dawn. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee and aided thee and revealed for thee that whose fragrance shall never cease throughout centuries and ages.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Ali-Akbar from the direction of My most luminous horizon, round which circle the Highest Paradise and the dwellers of the Kingdom of Names. Be thou thankful and say: Unto Thee be praise, O Lord of all humanity, and unto Thee be glory, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of all who are in earth and heaven. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and act according to what thou hast been commanded in the Mother Book. This is a Day wherein the Book speaketh and the Mother Book walketh and saith: “To Me, to Me, O concourse of the chosen ones!” Beware lest the might of the mighty weaken thee. Arise to serve the Cause with such resolve that the thorns of those who have denied the Beginning and the End cannot make thee slip. Thus have We illumined the horizon of utterance with the luminary of proof. Blessed is he who hath turned toward it and woe unto every doubting denier.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hasan! The Wronged One in prison makes mention of those who have turned toward His supreme horizon and counsels them with that which shall elevate their stations before God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed is the ear that hath heard what the Interlocutor heard and the eye that hath seen what other eyes and visions were prevented from seeing.</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! Set down what thou hast and take up what thou hast been commanded by God, the Lord of all religions. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken while the Wronged One was in the hands of the wicked. Take the cup of the choice wine in thy Lord’s name, then drink thereof with His remembrance at Whose appearance the earth was shaken and the mountains passed away. Say: Verily the choice wine is My verses, and the Mother Book is My Self, and the Book is My tongue from which the mysteries have appeared. Thus have We adorned the heaven of knowledge with brilliant stars, and I am the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Baqir! We counsel thee and Our loved ones with that which befitteth My days and their relationship to My Cause. Exalted is He Who hath appeared with power and sovereignty. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the allusions of the divines, nor the doubts of the theologians, nor the might of princes, nor the wealth of the rich shall debar thee. Thy Lord doth witness and hear, and He is in the most sublime horizon, and before His face the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End doth speak. Blessed is he who hath seen and heard when the Temple of Pre-existence was established upon the throne of grandeur and might.</p>
<p>O Ali-Akbar! Aid thy Lord, the Lord of Destiny, through wisdom and utterance, and through the hosts of deeds and character. We have sent down the verses and expounded them in truth, and We are verily the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. We have commanded all with that which draweth them nigh unto God, as attesteth the Mother Book which is with Him.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named after thee, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. Thou wert created for this Most Great Day wherein the Lord of Destiny proclaimeth: The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the worlds. We have remembered him who turned to Us and make mention of him in My perspicuous Book. Be thou thankful to God for this supreme bounty, then remember Him at all times.</p>
<p>O Ali-Asghar! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison, and summoneth thee to the Greater Steadfastness whereby the limbs of all creation trembled, save those whom God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, willed to exempt. This is a day wherein is heard the barking of dogs from all directions, and behind them the squealing of swine. Blessed is the soul whom the clamor of the people hath not prevented, who hath arisen and proclaimed: The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen the secrets of that which was recorded in the Book of Names, as witnesseth the clear Book which is with Him.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-’Abidin! Adorn thy head with the crown of certitude and thy temple with the ornament of steadfastness in this Day wherein every edifice hath been shaken, every heart troubled, and all limbs have trembled through fear of God, when He came from the heaven of will with manifest sovereignty. Cast aside what the people possess, holding fast to that which is with God, and be not of the heedless. By God! The Hidden One hath appeared and the Treasured Secret been revealed, yet We see the people among the heedless. Say: Fear God, O people, and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who calleth you unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Blessed is the servant who hath heard the call and answered his Lord, the All-Hearing; and woe unto him who hath denied God’s right and turned away from Him to Whom testified the Books of the world and beyond them He Who proclaimeth in every state that there is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Sadiq, that My remembrance may draw him to the kingdom of My utterance and bring him nigh unto the heaven of My loving-kindness, and I am verily the Compassionate, the Generous. Be thou steadfast in service to the Cause and vocal in thy Lord’s praise at all times. Soon shall pass away all thou beholdest today, and there shall remain for thee what hath been sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s favor and say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having caused me to hear Thy call, guided me to Thy path, and remembered me when I was wronged at the hands of those who were heedless of Thy Self and Thy hidden Book. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the breezes of Thy Revelation, the manifestations of Thy power, and the winds that blow in Thy days to quicken Thy creation, that Thou aid me in this Cause whereby the feet of the learned and the mighty have slipped, save those rescued by the hands of Thy power. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Protector, the Glorious, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>The Wronged One wishes to mention in prison the one named Rajab-’Ali that he may thank God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. We have indeed caused the rains of knowledge to pour forth from the clouds of utterance. Blessed is he who has recognized and attained, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. Beware lest thou be frightened by the oppression of any oppressor, the might of any polytheist, the denial of any denier, and the turning away of any who has turned away from God, the Lord of the Kingdom. Blessed is he who has arisen to proclaim: “By God! The Desired One has come with a sovereignty that neither the hosts of the world nor the clamor of those who have denied the Witness and the Witnessed can prevent.” He has come, He to Whom the Books of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, have testified. Among the people are those who have turned towards Him, heard and acknowledged, and among them are those who denied and turned away until they disbelieved in Him Whom they mention night and day. To this testifies He with Whom is the [preserved] Book. Blessed is he whom the breezes of My mercy have awakened and whom the winds of My loving-kindness have raised up in My days, and woe unto every transgressor whom vain imaginings have withheld from the Dayspring of knowledge.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The Wronged One mentions thee and bids thee to that whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. This is a Day wherein the Mount calls out: [“By God!] The Lord of Revelation has come, He Who was promised in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Beloved.” We counsel thee to be steadfast in this Most Great Announcement, whereby the Concourse on High rejoiced and every rejected polytheist lamented.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Verily Muhammad and Muhammad, then Muhammad and ’Ali and Muhammad are among those whose names were present before the Face, and there was revealed for them from the Kingdom of Will that which brought joy to the eyes of those near unto God. Know ye what hath been revealed for you. By God! He who hath attained unto My mention hath attained unto all good, but most of the people are heedless. Then preserve your stations in the name of your Lord, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. The transgressors have stationed themselves in ambush and prevent the people from turning to the countenance of God, the Lord of the worlds. Satan himself flees from their scheming and from what they possess. To this testifies He Who speaks at this hour: “The Kingdom is God’s, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” Thus have the fingers of proof woven the armor of utterance, as a bounty from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hasan! Hearken unto the call from the direction of ’Akka, which hath been named the White Dome and the Land of Resurrection in the Books of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. Whoso hath attained unto hearing it is indeed of the people of the Crimson Ark, which God hath specially ordained for the people of Baha. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Rejoice thou in My mention, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the One Who has sovereignty over all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Javad! The Lord of creation makes mention of thee from His abode and gives thee glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for those who have turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon, from God, the Ancient Sovereign. Verily, he who hath heard and acknowledged is among the people of this noble station. Let not the affairs of men sadden thee, nor the intimations of the deniers who mount the pulpits and deny the Manifestation of God and His signs - they are assuredly among the most lost. These claim to have faith and would beseech God by night and day for the appearance of this Cause which was mentioned in the Qur’an, the Torah and the Gospel. Yet when the promise was fulfilled and the Hidden One appeared, they pronounced judgment against Him with an injustice unequaled by any in the world. To this testifieth He Who possesseth the Book of God and the Tablet wherein was revealed that which none knoweth save He Who speaketh: “There is no God but Me, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.” Thus did the Pen of the Wronged One move in the Most Great Prison when sorrows encompassed Him from all sides through that which the hands of the idolaters had wrought - they who turned away from the Countenance when it shone forth from the horizon of revelation. They are indeed among the bewildered ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad Javad! The day of hearing hath come, yet most of the people hear not. The day of arising hath come, yet they remain seated. The world hath appeared for this Revelation, yet the people comprehend not. We call them to the supreme paradise, while they call Us to the fire. Thus have their souls seduced them, and they perceive it not. Blessed is the face that turneth away from them, setting itself toward God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Hold fast to the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>O Ustad Rajab-’Ali! Thy name hath appeared before the Wronged One, and the Most Exalted Pen of God hath moved to make mention of thee. Know thou this station, then give thanks to thy Lord, the Possessor of existence. He Who was promised hath come, He Who was concealed hath appeared, and He Who was hidden hath been made manifest. To this testifieth He Who, by the power of His Lord, hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings and suppositions. When thou art blessed with My verses and findest the fragrance of My loving-kindness, arise and say: “Praise be to Thee, O Thou through Whose remembrance the limbs of the ignorant tremble and the hearts of those who denied the Promised Day are disturbed.”</p>
<p>O Rida, son of Muhammad! Dost thou know Who maketh mention of thee? By the life of God, the Single, the One, Who was the goal of the Prophets and the Chosen Ones and the Dawning-Place of thy Lord’s will, the Possessor of might! He Who ascended to heaven hath come from it, and beareth witness before My face, yet the people hear not. Muhammad, the Apostle of God, hath testified to this Most Great Announcement, and Moses crieth out saying: “By God! The Revealer of the Torah, the Gospel and the Psalms hath come!” The lips of the world have smiled through recognizing My utterance. Blessed is he who hath found, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. This is a day wherein the doors of bounty and grace have been opened unto the faces of all peoples, yet they have turned away and denied God’s proof and evidence. They are indeed the losers. They have taken idols as lords for themselves instead of God, yet these shall not help them.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Siyyid ’Ali, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast heard the Call and been mentioned by the Dove, and there hath been sent down for thee that which no earthly thing can equal. Thy Lord is, verily, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Beware lest anything debar thee from the things of this world. Take thou the chalice of salvation in the name of Him Who causeth the dawn to break, and when thou hast attained unto it, arise and say: By the life of God! I have attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is the stranger who hath drawn nigh unto the Most Exalted Homeland, and the poor one who hath turned toward the Ocean of wealth, and the sick one who hath clung to the Dayspring of healing, Who hath come from heaven with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, the Stranger, Who hath been imprisoned and banished and exiled for having summoned mankind unto God, the One, the All-Informed. Listen in this hour to the Voice of the Spirit from the right hand of My mighty Throne, saying: O concourse of divines! Ye are the highwaymen of God and His paths, and the misleaders of His servants. Fear ye the All-Merciful, and draw not over the face of justice the veil of tyranny, nor over this heaven the clouds’ shroud. Soon shall the days pass, and ye shall find yourselves in the position of being questioned before God, the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. This is the day whereon Zion hath cried out and given glad tidings unto all of the Garden of inner meanings, which hath descended from heaven with a glory that none can deny save every sinful doubter. This is what hath been sent down in another Tablet to one of My servants, and I am the One Who sendeth down, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! By God, Paradise lamenteth because of your tyranny, and the chosen ones because of what hath befallen Us at the hands of your followers, who have clung to you without clear proof or evidence. Behold, then remember what ye have done aforetime to God’s friends and chosen ones, through whom the horizon of the world was illumined and the ocean of knowledge surged amongst the nations, and through whom the banners of unity were hoisted upon the hills.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Ja’far! God maketh mention of thee from His direction and counseleth thee to be steadfast in this Cause, the greatness of which was heralded by the tongues of the Prophets and the chosen ones, and before Whose manifestation necks have bowed down. Hold fast unto that whereby the Cause of God may be exalted, then make mention of Him at eventide and at dawn. We have sent down concerning every matter that which no books in the world can equal, whereunto the Mother Book beareth witness.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Ja’far! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One Who lamenteth in His heart and crieth out in His inner being and calleth with His tongue and writeth with His pen and pointeth with His fingers, that He may draw men nigh unto the Most Sublime Horizon, the station which the Seal of the Prophets and the Lord of the chosen ones did seek. Exalted is He Who hath appeared and called all unto the Dayspring of verses.</p>
<p>And at the end of the Tablet We make mention of My handmaidens who have believed in God and His signs, and who have turned towards Him when most of the servants turned away. O thou who circlest round My Cause and gazeth upon My countenance and uttereth My praise and soareth in Mine atmosphere! We have made mention of those whose names thou didst recount in thy letter, and have adorned them with the ornament of utterance in the realm of possibility. Exalted is the All-Merciful, the Source of this bounty and the Bestower of this station. Convey My greetings unto them, then remind them of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My loving-kindness, and give them the glad tidings of My mercy, which hath preceded all created things. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon those who are with thee and who hearken unto thy mention in this Cause whereby feet have slipped save such as God, the Lord of mankind, hath willed.</p>
<p>=== END BH00098 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00099 ===</p>
<p>He is God, exalted is His majesty and manifest His proof!</p>
<p>How wonderful that the Hand of God’s Will, exalted be His glory, is assisting, and the stars have emerged from the darkness of the prison-sky, radiant, luminous and resplendent. If prison is termed ‘heaven’, there is no harm, for it is the place of God’s loved ones - from God did they come, to God do they return, and of God do they speak. Praise befitteth the most exalted Court of the Intended One Who, from the prison, hath interpreted for the sincere ones the blessed verse “Every day He is in a new state”. Through the name of prison He hath elevated His friends to such a station that the tongues of the world fall short of describing it. He giveth and withholdeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He raiseth up a people through His sovereign might and bringeth low others. Verily, He hath power over all things. His power can make fire manifest from the mystery of light, and from light the consequence of fire. The rebellion of the peoples of the world diminisheth not His mercy, nor doth the certitude of His people add aught unto Him. Were His gracious Name to shed its radiance by less than a needle’s eye, no trace of rebellion would remain in creation, and were His Name of Justice to be revealed, the frames of the world would be bent low from the burden of transgression. He is the All-Bountiful Who withholdeth not His favors despite heedlessness, nor cutteth off sustenance from the transgressor. His mercy floweth like the Euphrates, and His generosity pervadeth and penetrateth like His Word of Command. His is the praise in all conditions, and He is the Self-Subsisting, the Most High.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the letters of that spiritual beloved which were addressed to the servant present, upon him be the Glory of God, were received and gained the honor of being heard in the most holy and exalted Presence. This is what the tongue of our Lord, the Most Merciful, hath spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance. His word, exalted be His might and sublime be His station:</p>
<p>He is the Helper, the Almighty […]</p>
<p>O thou who art imprisoned in My path! Hearken unto My call. Verily, He remembereth thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from all sides. He hath delivered you from prison that the heedless may know they cannot frustrate God. He announceth unto them at this moment a grievous chastisement. Grieve not because of those who have denied and turned away; they shall soon behold what hath been ordained for them by One mighty and powerful. By God! Their wailing and weeping shall profit them not. They shall find themselves in God’s torment without helper or protector. The heedless sought victory over Us through their troops, their ranks, their swords and their steeds, while We sought victory over them through God, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Thy letter hath arrived and was read by Him Who was present before the Throne. We have answered thee with verses that all in the world cannot equal, as this perspicuous Book doth testify. That which hath befallen you in My path hath caused My Pen to lament and those who circle round My glorious Throne to cry out. Blessed art thou and those who have shown patience and gratitude in adversity and tribulation. They are indeed among those near unto God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>We have remembered thee and those who were previously imprisoned with a remembrance from which those near unto God inhale the fragrance of eternity. Thus hath the matter been decreed by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take My Book with the strength bestowed by Me. Verily, He will assist you and draw you nigh. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>We have sent down the verses, yet the people hear not. We have revealed the clear proofs, yet mankind perceive not. They have cast knowledge behind their backs, hastening to a manifest delusion. He who turned away from God when He appeared with the truth and came with a mighty sovereignty. Say: O people! Fear God and take not your vain imaginings as lords besides God. Cast away what ye possess and take what ye are commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Informed.</p>
<p>We have remembered thee and those whose names thou didst mention, and have written for each one of them that which shall abide with them in the worlds of their Lord, the Kind, the Generous. We counsel them to preserve that which they have attained. Verily, thy Lord is the Counselor, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! The Most Great Vision hath been gladdened by the mention of God, His praise, His glorification, His exaltation, His grandeur, His majesty, and the praise of His loved ones, His chosen ones, His guides, and His beloved ones. The Wronged One hath heard thy call, thy lamentation, and that which thy heart’s tongue hath uttered in remembrance of God, thy Creator, thy Sustainer, thy Maker, thy Provider, and thy Helper. Thou didst remember Me, I shall remember thee. Thou didst thank Me, I shall thank thee. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou and those whom the power of the mighty did not weaken. They arose and proclaimed: “God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth.” These are servants whom God hath described in His Books of old and those yet to come. They are servants whose excellence and loftiness His loved ones’ tongues have acknowledged, saying “Their blessedness exceedeth our blessedness.” Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from this glorious and exalted Station.</p>
<p>The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the preservation of God’s trust, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of this exalted Station.</p>
<p>The effulgent rays of the Sun of divine favor are clear and evident from the luminous words. I swear by Him Who is the Desire of all who are in the heavens and on earth - in this instance there hath been revealed concerning the prisoners that which hath caused every living being to yearn for imprisonment. They beseech God - exalted be His glory - at all times that they may not be deprived of this bounty. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Praise be to God that all loss hath reverted to the aggressors and all profit to those who are nigh unto God, namely the prisoners. This is among the wondrous favors of the Lord of all worlds. Though this servant did not outwardly say “Would that I were with you!”, yet the heart hath continuously uttered “Would that I were!”. Praise be to God, glad-tidings have arrived from all directions. All were saddened upon entering the prison, but rejoiced upon leaving it. This was a blessing that accorded with the temperament of all the realms of inner meaning and utterance, despite those who have denied the verses of God, the Lord of this wondrous and glorious Day.</p>
<p>Fresh above all else was the manifestation of kindness and favor from His Majesty the Sultan. From the Tongue of Grandeur in the Tabernacle of Glory, these words were repeatedly heard. He said that a great kindness hath been shown by His Majesty the Sultan. We beseech God to aid and assist him. Similar to this exalted word He hath repeatedly spoken - to Him be praise and gratitude. God hath assisted His Majesty the Sultan to achieve this great good. We beseech God to open before his face the gate of truth and to illumine him with the light of the Sun of Justice. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about multiple letters being sent in the name of the honored servant - upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God - without receiving replies: at present His Honor spends several days, from sunrise until after sunset […]</p>
<p>Convey greetings to all the kindred, and adorn them with the ornament of the remembrance of God. Verily, He is with every one who remembereth Him, with every one who turneth unto Him, with every one who is oriented towards Him, with every one who holdeth fast unto Him, with every one who cleaveth unto Him, and with every one who gazeth toward His Most Exalted Horizon and Supreme Summit. The Glory that hath dawned from the heaven of My grace be upon them all, men and women alike, and upon them who have held fast unto My Sure Handle and clung to My Luminous Hem. His is the loving-kindness, and the bounty, and the generosity; His is the grace and the bestowal unto all who dwell on earth. In truth, all are bewildered, for the Sun of Grace hath shone forth in such wise that for a single drop of remembrance He hath bestowed an ocean of recompense, and for an atom of goodness He hath given rewards brilliant as the sun. This hath been witnessed and continues to be witnessed by all, but such as your honor and his kindred have attained unto that which thought and utterance fail to reckon, and the pen is powerless to describe. Who can describe him who hath arisen to serve Him Who is beyond description? Some time ago, this servant was present when the Ancient Beauty - upon Him be the most glorious of all glory - was mentioning with His tongue of grandeur the services of the leaf who is your honor’s wife, as well as those of other kindred. This servant beareth witness that none have been forgotten. The services of all are manifest, resplendent and evident in the sight of the Lord of all knowledge. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto service and been honored by the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. This remembrance hath a station that transcendeth description. By the life of our Goal and your Goal, our Beloved and your Beloved, immortality itself is ashamed to be associated with it. In truth, the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, hath a station that understanding cannot reach and human comprehension cannot grasp, except through His aid, blessed and exalted be He. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to all, and beseecheth God to cause all to attain unto that which beseemeth His days.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding the Huquq, after being submitted before the Divine Throne, these resplendent words shone forth from the horizon of the divine heaven - exalted be His utterance: “O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory! Today the payment of Huquq is obligatory and binding upon everyone. We have commanded its collection provided it is done in a spirit of joy and radiance - that is, that the servants of the All-Merciful pay it of their own accord with utmost happiness and gladness. If it is not paid in this manner, its collection is not permissible. For several years We forbade the trustees from collecting it. Later, in view of the requirements of wisdom, necessity demanded that We command its collection, subject to the aforementioned conditions. Blessed is the one who hath succeeded in paying it. By the life of God! Its benefit returneth to the souls themselves, would that they knew. It must be collected and spent according to God’s command. All must act in accordance with what hath been mentioned. None may dispose of it without permission. The purpose of these utterances is that disorder may not prevail and affairs may not transgress the divine law. The Hands of the Cause must strive diligently to execute the law and fundamental ordinances of God so that all may become aware and informed of God’s commandments. That which his honor ’Azim, upon him be My glory, hath given hath been accepted. Blessed is he, again blessed is he. We have forgiven him and purified him as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>That which hath been done regarding him hath been accepted before the Divine Countenance. Give him the glad-tidings of this wise remembrance. What was received hath been counted as Huquq, and this service hath been recorded in the Book by the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>This is a Day wherein no deed is lost, nor shall be lost. If one were to reflect upon that which hath been revealed concerning the deed of his honor ’Azim, one would attain to the recognition of this Day, the recognition of God’s friends, and the station of deeds. That which they have spent regarding that spiritual friend hath been counted as Huquq. Praise be to God Who hath assisted him to pay His dues and to obey His binding command in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>And as to what was written regarding the sister, upon her be the Glory of God, she hath indeed achieved a mighty matter. Praise be to God Who hath assisted her and enabled her to accomplish that which is celebrated by the Supreme Concourse, the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise, and those who circle round the mighty Throne. Mention of the sister hath been revealed in numerous Tablets. A robe was sent specifically for her. She hath been and is mentioned before the presence of the Ancient Beauty. Blessed is she, and blessed is any woman who hath done in the path of God that which the Most Exalted Pen hath mentioned from its exalted station. Praise be to God! This time all the brothers of his honor have been blessed with special favors. I beseech and implore God to assist and enable them all to serve His Cause.</p>
<p>The following was written concerning the matter of the meeting: After these lofty words were submitted, this was revealed from the heaven of divine will - exalted be His glory: “In these days new circumstances have arisen in this land, therefore We have withheld permission, and afterwards action will be taken according to the requirements of divine wisdom. Convey My greetings anew to all, that joy and gladness may draw them to a station where the deeds of the aggressors, the oppression of the tyrants, and the barking of the atheists will not sadden them. Whoso is for God, God is for him.” This blessed word was written that the loved ones may know with clear certitude that the truth has been and is with them, and if outwardly some are not granted the meeting, their reward has been recorded and revealed in the Book by the All-Bountiful Pen. This word is glad-tidings for those souls who have acted and continue to act for God’s sake.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about the loved ones in the land of ?a and Alif and Shin and other lands - upon them be the glory of God and His favors, mercy and bounties - these details were submitted to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of grandeur and power - glorified be His majesty:</p>
<p>“O people of God in [?a]! Ye have heard the Call when it was raised between earth and heaven. Hearken unto it once again from this Most Glorious Station, round which circle the Concourse on High at morn and eventide. That which hath caused the Spirit to lament and the Most Exalted Pen to cry out hath come to pass in a spot sanctified by God above all description. The dwellers of Paradise and the most exalted Garden, and they that abide in the Mansion at eve and at dawn give you glad tidings. O ‘Ali before Akbar! Glorify them on My behalf and remind them of that which hath been sent down for them from the Kingdom of the utterance of thy Lord, the Chosen One. Say: Beware lest ye be frightened by the might of those who enter their houses at eve and at dawn - the angels of punishment drive them to a most evil destination. Ye are they who have heard the taunts of the enemies and that which caused the Spirit and the Sovereign of the Messengers to lament in the most exalted chambers. Ye have attained in My path that which the Lord of Names hath revealed from His Most Exalted Pen - rejoice therefore, O ye who are endued with understanding. Thus have We sent down the verses unto you as a grace from Our presence, that they may attract you to a station where the intimations of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of Lords will not sadden you. Glory be upon you and upon whoso hath attained unto this Cause, whereby all things have proclaimed: ’The Kingdom belongeth to God, the One, the All-Forgiving.’”</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed from the heaven of the favors of our Exalted Lord for the people of ?a - exalted be His majesty and sublime be His utterance:</p>
<p>He is the Speaker, the Answerer […]</p>
<p>O people of gold! Upon you be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High! The Wronged One of the world hath, from the Most Great Prison, turned toward you out of pure grace. All princes, divines, religious doctors and men of letters have yearned for this Day, beseeching God night and day for His presence. Yet when the Most Great Luminary arose from the horizon of the heaven of manifestation, shining and resplendent, and the One Who conversed on Sinai spoke forth and made mention, all remained veiled save a few souls. By the life of God! He uttered a Word whereby all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck, save a handful of letters. The Face of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, shall endure. Praise be to God that ye have attained unto this most great bounty and supreme gift. Now beseech ye God that ye may be assisted to remain steadfast with supreme steadfastness. Reflect upon the Shiite divines and that party. They all would say “hasten, O God,” yet when the rain of knowledge and wisdom poured down from the clouds of the grace of the Lord of Revelation, they all turned back, incurring God’s wrath. Reflect upon the deeds of that wicked band, that ye may henceforth remain preserved and not be deprived anew by such utterances from the straight path and the manifest, clear way. The Glory and mercy of God be upon you and upon those who are with you.</p>
<p>This was revealed for the people of Alif and Shin.</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who ruleth over all names!</p>
<p>O party of God in Alif and Shin! The honored Amin, upon him be My Glory, mentioned you before, and again the honored Ali-Qabl-i-Akbar, upon him be My Glory, who was imprisoned for My Name, hath mentioned you thereafter. Therefore hath the Supreme Pen engaged in your mention. We beseech God that He may assist all to achieve that which hath been revealed in God’s Book from the Eternal Pen. The days are passing, and ere long all that is on earth shall return to nothingness. What hath been revealed for you shall endure and shall testify for you in all the worlds of your Lord. Be thankful unto God for this great bounty. God’s tender mercies have encompassed you and His grace shall be with you. Strive that ye may achieve deeds that extinction shall not overtake and that shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endure. The mention of all hath been and shall be in the Most Holy Court. The Glory be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you.</p>
<p>And this was revealed for his honor Muhammad.</p>
<p>O Muhammad, reflect upon what hath come to pass, that thou mayest become aware of what the modern idolaters intend. The Shi’ih sect, who considered themselves the most ancient of peoples, the most exalted of servants, and the most refined of souls, were mentioned before the Divine Countenance as the most abject of people and the most wretched of servants. At times they were deluded by mention of the Successor, and at others preoccupied with mention of the Guardian, sometimes boasting of Jabulqa and Jabulsa and the realm of falsehood. How many souls were slain by these vain imaginings, and the Lord of the world was martyred by the swords of falsehood of those souls. Now too a group hath appeared in the land of Kaf and Ra, who have adorned the steed of idle fancies with the saddle of passion and have intended Jabulqa and Jabulsa. God protect us and you, O concourse of the sincere ones! In brief, those falsehoods have emerged anew, for they have not yet realized that today is the Day of God and no mention is beloved except His mention. What fruit did that heedless party reap from their former utterances, that these souls should again intend thus? Fie upon them and upon what their hands have wrought! Hold fast unto Him, exalted be His glory, and be free and detached from all else. Today the books of the world provide no salvation except through this perspicuous Book. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the people of that land, that perchance they may drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness and detach themselves from all save God. The Command is in His grasp; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning the people of Mim, as well as the prisoners, all are mentioned before the Divine Throne and have attained the grace of God, exalted be His glory. Give thou glad-tidings unto them all and assure them of divine grace. And as for what thou didst mention regarding the people of Sin and Shin, after being presented before the Most Great Scene, these manifest verses were sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Destiny - exalted be His mention and His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the Manifest Book</p>
<p>He verily speaketh in this hour that which the Tongue of Grandeur spoke before the creation of the heavens and earths: He is God; there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Sin (China)! Hearken unto My call from the precincts of My prison, then call to mind what hath befallen Me and My loved ones at the hands of them that cast the Truth behind their backs, turning unto every doubting polytheist. The divines have prevented the people of creation from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all names, when He came from heaven with great sovereignty. Thus did their souls entice them. They are indeed among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. The Most Great Ocean hath surged, and the horizon of utterance hath been illumined by the sun of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We counsel you with that whereby the Cause will be exalted, and with the trustworthiness which We have mentioned aforetime - a command from Us, and I am the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing. Say: O people! Fear God, and deny not the Truth through what ye possess. By the life of God! Neither the books of the world nor the scriptures of the nations shall profit you. Fear God, O concourse of earth, and be not of the heedless. He Who was hidden in the presence of knowledge and inscribed in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised, hath been made manifest. The croaking hath been raised, and that whereof We informed you aforetime hath appeared. He is, verily, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Soon will a croaker come unto you with the book of the wicked, to debar you from My straight path - at one time showing humility, at another with great deceit. We counseled all beforehand and gave tidings of the croaker. Blessed is the soul from whom the croakers perceive the fragrance of supreme steadfastness, such that the limbs of polytheism tremble and the hearts of the hypocrites are troubled. Whosoever uttereth any word today save the mention of God hath been and shall be rejected in God’s sight. After manifold tribulations, bearing hardships, and exile from land to land, the Sun of Manifestation did at last shine forth and Its effulgences encompassed all. Certain ones emerged from behind the veil of concealment and firmly girded themselves to lead God’s loved ones astray. Whoso pondereth the fruits of the deeds of the Islamic sect, and likewise the false traditions whereby they have barred the hapless people from the straight path, will in no wise draw nigh unto such souls, nor will he deem their vain imaginings worthy of attention. We beseech God to aid you, draw you nigh, and grant you the good of this world and the next. He, verily, hath power over whatsoever He willeth. O people of Sin! Know ye the worth of the divine mention and inscribe it upon the tablet of the heart with the pen of steadfastness, that it may not vanish from sight and that thieves and traitors may find no way unto it.</p>
<p>Thus endeth what was revealed for the friends of God in Shin (China).</p>
<p>He is the True Speaker, the Trustworthy One.</p>
<p>O people of Shin! The Beloved of the world confirmed you in your devotion and turning unto Him, and blessed you with the recognition of a Cause which the Prophets and Messengers yearned and hoped to recognize and attain unto. This is a supreme bounty and an exalted station that requires diligent effort to preserve. This is the Day which We heralded to Abraham, made known to Moses, and to which We guided Isaiah, John and Christ, and about whose greatness the Seal of the Prophets informed all. Were one to take its description from the divine Books, no word would remain, yet those possessed of true knowledge are well aware of this station. From the beginning of the Cause until now, We have accepted all earthly tribulations for the sake of God. By night and day the Supreme Pen has been in motion and the waters of mercy have flowed from the right hand of the Throne. When the world was adorned with this wondrous and new ornament, the hypocrites, with the utmost deceit and craft, strove to lead souls astray. The counsel of the Supreme Pen to His loved ones is to fix their gaze solely on the highest horizon and to purify their ears from tales of the past and future, that they may attain true hearing. We beseech God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, to assist you, draw you nigh, and grant you the Kawthar of steadfastness. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>This lowly one beseeches the Eternal Truth not to deprive the people of that land from the sealed wine and the favors of the Self-Subsisting Lord, and to confirm them in the most great steadfastness, until all the treacherous ones, the deceitful ones, and the cawing ones find themselves powerless to prevent them. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The mention of greetings and salutations to all is entrusted to your honor.</p>
<p>The mention of the handmaiden of God, Maryam, was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for her from the heaven of the bounty of her Lord, the All-Forgiving:</p>
<p>He is the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! We make mention in this station of him who is named Yahya and give him glad tidings of the favors of his Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. We have remembered those who have turned to the highest horizon and have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Generous. O Yahya! Blessed art thou for having taken hold of the Book with strength from thy Lord. We counsel thee at this time to preserve this mighty station. We also make mention of My handmaiden whom We have adorned with the ornament of My love and given to drink of the Kawthar of My beautiful remembrance. She remembered her Lord at the time of her ascension, and We remembered her as a grace from Us and caused her to enter beneath the shade of My Lote-Tree, whose leaves proclaim: “There is none other God but Me, the Single One, the All-Informed.” We have forgiven her as a mercy from Us, and We are the Forgiver, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Concerning what was written requesting permission to journey to the Land of Mim to console the friends in that land, this matter was presented. His blessed and exalted Word states: This matter is most praiseworthy. It is essential that someone arise to perform this great service and illumine the oppressed ones in the valley of tyranny with the light of justice, console them, and shower upon those wronged ones, from the presence of Truth, an ocean of mercy that cannot be contained within the garment of words. O Ali, all have attained the grace of God and the word of pardon has been revealed for all. Some were seized with fear and the might of oppression made them anxious. The tribulation was great and the fire of tyranny was ablaze. The transgressors acted with such hardness of heart that the Pen is ashamed to recount it. However, the life of this world is brief. Let them not be sorrowful, for whatsoever occurred was for God’s sake and was encountered in His path. This tribulation was and is sweet to the taste of the lovers. However, your honor should consult with others in that land and act accordingly. Great wisdom is needed lest what happened before should happen again. One must move with perfect wisdom. The ignorant people have been and are waiting to cause turmoil. However, God protects His servants. He is, verily, powerful over all things. After consultation, if you decide to proceed, spend that sum in His path. Thus do We command thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>A Tablet was previously revealed and sent especially for your honor, and likewise another Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed but its dispatch was delayed. Now, according to the command, that too has been sent. God willing, may you drink and give others to drink from the ocean of inner meanings hidden in the revealed verses and blessed Tablets. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who drinks from thy hand the cup of thy Lord’s and my Lord’s bounty. The two mentioned Tablets were revealed from the heaven of grace during the days when you were in prison. In truth, no one can enumerate His bounties and favors. His is the praise in all conditions. The Most Great Branch and likewise the Greater Branch, may my spirit be sacrificed for them both, convey their greetings and manifest their past and present kindness. They shared in the grief and they share in the joy. All the members of the pavilion of grandeur and infallibility convey their greetings to your honor and to the Leaf, your wife, your sister, and your male and female relatives, and express their love. In truth, this new imprisonment was different from previous imprisonments, for it was the dawning-place of the greatest sorrow and likewise the greatest joy. Praise and gratitude be to God for all that He does. He brings low and He raises up, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Exalted is He Who is praised in His actions and obeyed in His command, and He is the Mighty, the Wise. Peace and greetings and glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who have drunk the wine of revelation, detached from those who disbelieved and were heedless and associated partners with God and turned away from God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>As commanded, convey My greetings to the son of the Most Holy A?daq. The delay in answering his petitions was due to the upheaval in this land. From the time of the upheaval in the land of ?a until now, discussions have arisen concerning every matter […]. Likewise, the answer to the petitions of Mirza Asadu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, will arrive, God willing, in these days. Again convey greetings from this Wronged One to the people of the Letter ’Ayn and likewise to the companions in that land, and give them the glad-tidings of the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Say: Your righteousness has become as evident and manifest as the sun, for until this day - that is, from the beginning of creation until now - what has befallen you has befallen the people of truth. They are witnesses unto you and you are witnesses unto them, and God is witness unto both. O ’Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. All must act with wisdom and hold fast unto it. Impart the meaning of wisdom that all may act in accordance with that which God hath ordained. This is a great good. Glory and praise be upon them and upon the steadfast servants of God.</p>

<p>This is the Tablet of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the ocean of divine knowledge surged within all possibility</p>
<p>Exalted is the All-Merciful Who sent down the Torah, the Gospel, and the Furqan, then the Bayan, and revealed the Mother Book when the Hidden Secret was established upon the throne of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, and proclaimed in the most exalted call: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all return!” When the call was raised, hearts were stirred with longing to hearken unto the verses of God, the Lord of lords. We have sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs, yet the people are in strange doubt.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Hear the call from the direction of ’Akka. We have made mention of thee, before and after, with that which neither the treasures of earth nor its riches can equal. The Book of God in its most exalted station beareth witness to this. We have expounded the Point and interpreted the Books of God. Blessed is he who hath recognized and attained, and woe unto every idolatrous infidel. We heard thy call and addressed thee from the side of the Mount, casting unto thee that whereby the hearts of the servants were attracted. Thou art he who hath drunk the choice sealed wine through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and hast guided the servants to the straight path.</p>
<p>O Haydar! Roll up the sleeve of endeavor, then gird up thy loins to make mention of this Most Great Announcement, whereby the parties have fled when the Lord of all men established Himself upon the throne of wisdom and utterance. We have been with thee in all conditions and heard thy call and the call of those who were present with thee, and We have mentioned each one of them with that whereby the luminary of My loving-kindness and mercy, which hath preceded all created things, hath shone forth.</p>
<p>And We make mention at this time once again of the party of God whose names thou didst mention, as a grace from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O My servant, O Thabit! There hath been sent down for thee aforetime that from which lights have shone forth, and We saw thy mention in the book of one who loved Me. We have mentioned thee time and again that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Manifest of clear proofs. We heard thy call and addressed thee from the direction of the Ancient One, the seat of thy Lord’s throne, the Lord of all peoples. Verily thy Lord doeth what He willeth, and He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We desired to answer him whose letter was present before the Wronged One, that the verses might attract him to the Dayspring of divine knowledge.</p>
<p>Jinab-i-Aqa Kuchik</p>
<p>In My Name, the Guardian over all names</p>
<p>O Aqa Kuchik! As thou hast turned to the lights of the Sun of Truth, thou art great in the presence of the Wronged One. Whosoever today hath attained unto the supreme horizon and acknowledged the traces of the Most Exalted Pen, he is recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen as of the people of God in the Crimson Tablet. Blessed is the soul that hath not been prevented by the veils of glory from turning unto Him, nor held back by the doubts of the divines and the objections of the mystics from the ultimate goal and the supreme summit. Today the ocean of truth is surging and the sun of revelation is shining. Blessed is the eye that hath seen and the ear that hath heard. We beseech God to assist thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest remain steadfast in the Cause of God and drink from the ocean of utterance at all times. He is the Compassionate, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>’Ali, servant of H</p>
<p>He is the Hearing, the Answering</p>
<p>O Ali! Your letter was received and attained unto the presence of the Desired One of all the worlds. Your service is accepted and mention of you hath been heard. Blessed is the soul whom the vicissitudes of days withheld not from the Lord of all names, nor deprived thereof, and blessed is the servant whom neither the doubts of the dubious nor the might of the aggressive prevented from turning unto the Truth. Praise be to God that thy call hath been heard and thy mention hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty. We beseech God to assist His party to remember and praise Him and to serve His Cause, and to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>Aqa Mirza Ali: O Haydar! We have desired to make mention of him who is named Ali, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. From My Most Exalted Pen hath flowed the river of wisdom and utterance. Blessed is he who hath drunk therefrom, and woe unto the heedless. By the life of God! In every letter of My Book are treasured sciences which none hath discovered save God, the Single, the All-Informed. O Ali! Thou hast heard My call and attained unto My days. Praise thy Lord and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens, for having remembered me while I was in the hands of the oppressors.</p>
<p>Mashhadi Hasan-Ali Khayyat: We make mention of him who is named Hasan-Ali and counsel him to observe justice and that whereby the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be exalted. We have mentioned him before and at this hour We beseech God to assist him in that which will draw him nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Bountiful. O servants of God! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and be not of the heedless. Take the chalice of recognition in the name of your Lord, the Merciful, and be not of the patient ones. He hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in knowledge. To this testifieth every fair-minded and informed one.</p>
<p>Haji Mirza Shukrullah: We desire to make mention of him who is named Shukrullah and remind him of My verses and give him the glad-tidings of My tender mercy, that he may arise to serve My mighty and glorious Cause. Thou didst attain aforetime and We revealed for thee that which caused the hearts of the hearers to soar. When the wine of My utterance did intoxicate thee and the fragrances of My verses did attract thee, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou art He through Whose Name the ocean of utterance surged before the eyes of all mankind and the fragrance of Thy mercy was wafted throughout all lands. I beseech Thee by the penetrating influence of Thy Will and the power of Thy Purpose and the movement and sound of Thy Most Exalted Pen and by Thy Most Glorious Horizon and its light, to make me in all conditions well-pleased with Thee and holding fast unto Thee, in such wise that the tempests of the intimations of them that croak, who have turned away from Thee and Thy verses and have taken for themselves a lord besides Thee from their own idle fancies, may not move me. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee and holding fast unto Thee. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the ocean of Thy utterance nor from the sun of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty, and worthy to grant this prayer.</p>
<p>We make mention of your two sons and give them glad tidings of the favors of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech Him to ordain for them that which shall profit them and draw them nearer unto Him. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>We make mention of My handmaiden and My leaf who hath heard, responded, and turned with her heart to the horizon of God, the Goal of them that have knowledge. O My handmaiden! Most of the servants’ ears have not been honored with the words “O My servant,” yet thou hast been honored with “O My handmaiden.” Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest favor. We have heard thy call and that which proceeded from thy mouth in praise of God, the Lord of the worlds. We made mention of thee before in a Tablet which proclaimed that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say: “Thine be the praise, O Lord of the world, and Thine be the glory, O Thou the Goal of the hearts of the Messengers!”</p>
<p>Aqa Muhammad Hasan, the Cloth Merchant:</p>
<p>O Muhammad Hasan! We have desired to make mention of thee that My remembrance may draw thee to My Kingdom and strengthen thee to praise God, glorify Him, and serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. The call hath been raised from the right hand of the Throne, yet most of the people are asleep. Heedlessness hath so seized them that they have turned away from Him Who hath come from the horizon of might with clear authority.</p>
<p>Muhammad Hasan:</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad Hasan that he may give thanks unto his Lord and be of them that are steadfast. Say: “Withhold not your ears from hearkening to the call of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.” Blessed art thou for having attained unto My verses and for having been mentioned in My mighty prison.</p>
<p>’Ali Aqa:</p>
<p>We make mention of ’Ali before Aqa, and I am the best of them that make mention. My mention equals not the mentions of the world, nor My call the call of the nations. To this beareth witness the Most Great Name in this exalted station. Thus have We mentioned thee that thou mayest rejoice and arise to serve thy Lord Who hath come with a clear Book.</p>
<p>O Haydar before ’Ali! Thou art he who heard My call, turned to My direction, stood before the door of My grandeur, beheld My horizon, attained unto My verses, and drank the choice wine of My favor and the Kawthar of My wondrous utterance. My Tablets have testified to My favor unto thee and My bounty upon thee. Art thou able to thank thy Lord, or dost thou find thyself among the impotent?</p>
<p>Thou hast made mention of My Afnan, upon them be My glory and My favor. We have mentioned them with that which no mention can equal and have raised them to a station whose description defieth every knowledgeable rememberer. We beseech God to aid them to preserve this mighty and sublime station. Remember them on My behalf, and greet their faces from My side, and give them glad tidings of My mercy, and illumine them with that which hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of My Most Exalted Pen. Thus doth He command thee, with Whom is the knowledge of the heavens and earth. We have mentioned each one of them in various Tablets and adorned them with My kinship, and I am the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Mirza Ja’far:</p>
<p>O Ja’far! The Hour hath come, yet most of the people are heedless. The Resurrection hath appeared, yet they remain far from understanding. Blessed is he who hath recognized and preserved the Faith; he is among those who are nigh unto God in His mighty and great Book.</p>
<p>Aqa Abu’l-Qasim:</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! We have sent down from the fountain of My Most Exalted Pen the waters of utterance, that there might grow in the hearts of the servants the plants of wisdom and knowledge. Blessed is the soul that hath testified to that which God hath testified and hath attained unto that which hath been sent down from Him. Such a one is among the unitarians in the sight of God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Aqa Muhammad Karim, the Hat-maker […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Karim! Hast thou heard the Call and beheld My Most Exalted Horizon, and hast thou arisen in My days to serve My loved ones? Tell Me what We have asked of thee, for I am the All-Knowing Narrator. We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee. Blessed is he who hath arisen to serve Me, he who was named Haydar-’Ali. He mentioned thee, and We mentioned thee, by a command from My presence, and I am the Ancient Commander.</p>
<p>Aqa Muhammad-Rida-i-Qullati! O Muhammad-Rida! We mentioned thee before and at this time, that the fragrances of utterance may seize thee and draw thee to a station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower!”</p>
<p>Mirza Aqa-yi-Naqqash! O Painter! Upon thee be My Glory! Hath thy pen succeeded in portraying My loved ones, and hath it moved to draw those who were martyred in My path? Blessed is the face that hath turned toward the lights of the Countenance, and the heart that hath turned to the Most Exalted Station. We mentioned thee before with that which caused the breeze of utterance to waft over all possibility. Thank thy Lord and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world, and glorification be unto Thee, O Lord of lords!”</p>
<p>Haji Mulla Muhammad-i-Hakkak! O Muhammad! That which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books and Tablets hath appeared. He Who was promised in the books of old hath come, and He with Whom God, the One, the Chosen, gave glad tidings in His Books, hath been made manifest. Yet when the verses were sent down and the clear proofs appeared, the people turned away and denied God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the trace of My Pen at this time which God, the Lord of all ages, hath ordained.</p>
<p>Mashhadi ’Ali-Akbar! O ’Ali-before-Akbar! The Remembered One hath remembered thee while He was in the hands of the wicked. He hath sent down that which the pens are powerless to reckon, and revealed that which those possessed of insight were prevented from understanding. Blessed art thou, for thy mention hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen, as a bounty from God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>’Ali Bey! O ’Ali! The Wronged One hath come with the truth and hath called all to God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Calling, and hath given them glad tidings of that which God, the Cleaver of the Dawn, hath ordained for those near unto Him. Among the people are those who denied, those who turned toward Him, and those who pronounced sentence to shed My blood without any proof or book.</p>
<p>Mashhadi ’Abbas! O ’Abbas! The Lord of mankind hath turned toward thee from the prison quarter and remembereth thee with that whose fragrance shall never cease. Preserve this Most Exalted Station in the name of thy Lord, the Subduer of the winds.</p>
<p>Muhibb-’Ali! O Muhibb-’Ali! Blessed is the ear that hath attained unto hearing My call, the eye that hath beheld My signs, the tongue that hath spoken My praise, the heart that hath turned to My horizon, and the foot that hath arisen to serve mankind. Glorify the name of thy Lord! He hath remembered thee with that which shall not change throughout ages and centuries, and hath built for thee, with the hand of power, a house from the verses of utterance, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Lord of all religions. We beseech God to assist thee to preserve this Most Exalted Station, which hath flowed from a Pen through whose movement all created things were set in motion. O Thou Who art wronged throughout the horizons! Remember him who hath held fast to the Covenant when the people of discord and hypocrisy turned away from God, the Illuminator of the horizons.</p>
<p>Aqa Buzurg!</p>
<p>O Bozorg! The Wronged One makes mention of thee - He Whom the servants in all regions have denied, speaking that which caused the Maid of Paradise in the all-highest Heaven to strike her face in anguish. Thus was the matter decreed, yet the people are in strange delusion. When thou hast attained unto the traces of My Most Exalted Pen and drunk the choice wine of utterance from the cup of thy Lord’s bounty, the Lord of all names, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having remembered me, and glory be to Thee for having turned toward me, and thanksgiving be to Thee for having guided me, and splendor be to Thee for having taught me that which the possessors of wisdom have failed to comprehend.</p>
<p>MIRZA KAZEM: O Kazem! Hear the call from the direction of eternity through the Most Exalted Pen. Verily He makes mention of thee in such wise as nothing in the world can equal, as attested by the Mother Book which is with Him. Thou hast attained unto the traces of My Pen and My loving-kindness which hath encompassed all regions.</p>
<p>QASEM ALI: We have desired to make mention of him who was named Qasem before Ali, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. My mercy hath preceded and My grace hath encompassed all. Blessed is he who hath recognized, and woe unto every denying infidel.</p>
<p>AGHA ALI: O Ali! The Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward the city of My Herald. By the life of God! The sincere ones shall perceive from its dust the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of lords. We have remembered Our loved ones there and given them glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for them by the Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. The mention of him who turned toward Ta hath come before Us - We saw him and were with him until he departed therefrom, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Then he who turned toward Sad, then he who left his place, advancing toward the Most Sublime Horizon until he entered and was present and heard and saw what had been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of God, the Lord of all men. O My loved ones there! We have remembered you with such remembrance that when it appeared, all remembrances cried out: By God! He Who is the Remembered One hath come with power and sovereignty. We have not mentioned the names of Our loved ones out of wisdom from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who is named Haji Agha with such remembrance that through it the thirsty shall find the waters of life, the lovers the choice wine of reunion, and the yearning ones the pure stream of attainment. Thus have the nightingales of proof warbled upon the highest branches. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and the eye that hath beheld the signs of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Mirza Muhammad Bazzaz</p>
<p>We make mention of those who heard the call and responded to their Lord, the All-Merciful, with spirit and fragrance. Among them is he who is named Muhammad. The Most Exalted Pen hath spoken in his remembrance that which hath caused the sweet savors of the All-Merciful to waft throughout all creation. Hear the call of the Wronged One, then thank Him for having sent down unto thee that whose fragrance shall never cease throughout the centuries and ages. Thus hath the Dove of the Throne warbled while the Wronged One was in the hands of the wicked ones.</p>
<p>Mashhadi Haydar Masjidi</p>
<p>O Haydar! The Lord of Destiny hath made mention of thee from the Most Great Scene that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Verily He seeth His servants and heareth their remembrance, and He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Nothing whatsoever preventeth Him from anything, nor is anything hidden from His knowledge. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in His presence. When thou hast attained unto My verses and heard My call, say: All praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and all thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>Shaykh Muhammad Husayn</p>
<p>O Muhammad Husayn! Hear the call from the Wronged One. He counseleth thee and those who have believed in that which shall exalt your station among the righteous. Hold fast unto justice and equity. This is what ye have been commanded in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. They who have turned away from that which they were commanded, they are assuredly among the people of the fire in the sight of God, the One, the Single, the Peerless, the Almighty, the Compelling. Take what hath been sent down unto thee as a command from Us, and I am the Mighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>A clear Book sent down from the Trustworthy One unto him who hath believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. They who have attained unto My Most Exalted Word, they are the companions of Baha. Their names have been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Aqa ’Ali Muhammad</p>
<p>O ’Ali Muhammad! Behold then make mention when We sent the Primal Point with the hosts of revelation and inspiration. How the factions spoke concerning Him - among them were those who denied Him, those who turned away from Him, and those who pronounced sentence of death against Him. By this did the denizens of earth and heaven lament, as did My Most Exalted Pen in this spot which hath been named the Most Great Prison, and in the Land of Mystery, and in Zawra, and before that in Ta. To this doth the Tongue of Grandeur bear witness from His luminous horizon. Hear the lamentation of My Pen in the evening and at sunrise, at eventide and at dawn. By God’s life! It weepeth even as weep the bereaved at what befell My Herald Who sacrificed His soul for My sake and gave the glad-tidings unto the servants of My advent and My mighty announcement. Say: O people of the Bayan! He hath come from the horizon of might concerning Whom the Primal Point declared “I, verily, am the first of them that worship Him.” By God’s life! His joy was naught but for My manifestation and His sorrow naught but for My tribulation. To this doth bear witness every fair-minded one possessed of knowledge who hath read the Bayan and hath been just in the Cause of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Aqa ’Ali Rida […]</p>
<p>O Ali-Rida! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the Lord of all names. He, verily, draweth thee nigh unto Him and guideth thee unto a glorious station. O peoples of the earth! He Who was promised in the Books of God hath come, He Whose remembrance was treasured in the hearts of the Messengers. He hath come to reform the world and to refine the nations. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, and woe betide him whom the world hath deluded and kept back from this manifest grace. We beseech God to aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for thee what He hath ordained for His sincere servants.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Hearken unto the call of God, the One, the Single. Beware lest anything prevent thee from hearkening unto the Word of God, the One, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. This is the Day wherein necks have bowed before the Lord of Lords, and the Tongue of Revelation hath spoken forth and warbled. Take thou the Book of God by Our command, and follow not him who hath disbelieved and turned aside. I am, verily, the Kaaba of God amidst mankind. Turn ye unto Him with radiant faces. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of that which hath been ordained for you and follow him who hath turned away from God. Leave the people to their vain imaginings, and hold ye fast unto the Cord of God, the One, the Powerful, the Trust-worthy. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, and borne witness that there is none other God but Him. Blessed is he who hath testified to that whereunto God hath testified, and hath striven in His Cause and made effort.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rida, son of the sister! The Ancient Countenance hath turned towards thee and revealed for thee that which hath caused the Orb of Bounty to shine forth from the horizon of the world. When thou hearest the Call, arise and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings, for having sent down unto me the verses from the heaven of Thy Most Great Name.” Blessed is he who hath turned unto the Supreme Horizon, and heard My most sweet call, and won the fruits of the Pen. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged, revealing its pearls in the days of its Lord, the Ancient of Days. O people of Baha! By God, this Day is your day. Leave ye the people and what they possess, turning unto the station wherein the Tongue of Grandeur hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of all nations.” This is the Day whereon that which was hidden from eternity of eternities hath been revealed, and the fragrance of glory and bounty hath wafted over the world.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabli-Hasan! He Who soareth in Mine atmosphere hath remembered thee. We make mention of thee with that which shall draw thee nigh unto Mine horizon, that thou mayest witness what My Pen hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou hast attained unto My remembrance and unto that which My glorious and wondrous tongue hath uttered. Nothing in the world shall profit thee today save this Cause, before which, when it was made manifest, every discerning one bowed down. We have revealed the Cause and sent down the verses, yet the people are in evident doubt. They have denied the right of God and His signs, and have followed every froward sinner. Give thanks unto God for this supreme bounty and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know.”</p>
<p>O Sayfu’llah! The law of the sword hath been annulled, and the law of the Bayan hath been revealed. It is sharper than the sword, as the tongue of My grandeur doth testify in this exalted station. We have ordained victory and triumph through the fear of God, and through deeds and character, as witnesseth he who hath attained the presence of the Face and heard the call of God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest ye spread corruption in the earth after its reformation, and beware lest ye oppose those who have opposed you. Leave them to themselves, turning unto God, your Lord, the Commander, the All-Wise. We have enjoined upon you love and unity. Blessed is he who acteth in accordance with that which hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Aqa Buzurg […]</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Buzurg. Say: The Truth hath come, and on His right is the dominion of verses and on His left the kingdom of evidences, while before His face standeth the Manifestation of names and attributes, addressing the servants and pointing to His countenance: “This is what ye were promised in the Books of God aforetime, and in the Bayan, the Qur’an, the Torah and the Gospel.” Beware, O people of the earth, lest ye deprive yourselves of the Revelation of God and His sovereignty, and beware lest ye deny God’s favor after its descent. Draw nigh with illumined hearts and be not among the wrongdoers. The signs have appeared, the appointed time hath come, and the Hidden One hath been made manifest through a clear command. Beware lest ye reject the truth through your idle fancies. Cast away vain imaginings, holding fast to that which hath dawned and shone forth from the horizon of your Lord’s tender mercy, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! We have sent down for thee in the prison that which hath brought delight to the eyes of the Concourse on high and the exalted Paradise. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this supreme favor. Once We revealed verses unto thee in a clear Arabic tongue, and another time We changed it to the luminous language, and We mentioned thee in a wondrous Persian tongue. Once We sent thee the Water of Life in remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, and another time the breezes of revelation whereby the realms of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised, were perfumed. Canst thou reckon up that which hath shone forth from the lights of My dominion and My kingdom, and that which hath appeared from the horizon of My wondrous utterance?</p>
<p>While We were contemplating Our Revelation, Our power and Our sovereignty, and the heaven of Our Will and the kingdom of Our Purpose, there came before the Greatest Vision the Most Great Branch, who drew forth from his pocket a letter wherein mention was made of My loved ones who had turned toward My horizon, who had held fast to My cord, who had clung to the hem of My bounty, who had soared in My atmosphere, and who had spoken My praise. When We heard mention of them, We opened the gate of utterance with the key of Our grace and revealed for each one that which would attract the hearts of the sincere. We saw mention of him who was named Muhammad-Qabli-Hashim, whose letter had previously been presented before the Wronged One Who was imprisoned for having called all to God, the One, the All-Informed. We read his letter and revealed for him that which cannot be equaled by all that is witnessed and seen. To this beareth witness He Who at this moment speaketh: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Make mention of him on My behalf, remind him of My verses, and give him the glad-tidings of My grace. We counsel him to manifest supreme steadfastness in this Cause whereby the hearts of all beings were troubled, the company of the divines lamented, and the feet of the mystics slipped.</p>
<p>Take My Book with a power from Me. Let not the swords of the world and the hosts of the nations frighten thee. By the life of the Most Merciful! There hath been ordained for thee that which minds cannot reckon and thoughts cannot encompass. Verily thy Lord is the True One, the Speaker, the Trustworthy. Preserve this most exalted station. Let nothing whatsoever hinder thee. Cast aside the world and all that is therein, turning with thy heart to My glorious horizon. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the Wronged One was seated upon His mighty throne. Give thanks unto God and say […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! My limbs tremble in my separation from Thee, my heart is troubled in my remoteness from Thee, and my soul laments in my distance from the court of Thy glory. I know not, O my Desire, my Adored One, my Hope and my Trust, whether Thou hast ordained for me to attain the presence of Thy countenance, to stand before the gate of Thy grandeur, to hearken to the scratching of Thy Pen, and to witness the lights of Thy Throne, or whether Thy irrevocable decree hath debarred me from this and from the wonders of Thy grace, O Thou Lord of all worlds. I beseech Thee by Thy perspicuous Book, by Thy mighty Prison, by the rustling of Thy Lote-Tree, and by the light of Thy Cause, to make me one of those whose feet have not slipped and whose hearts have not wavered, who have arisen and proclaimed: “O concourse of the world! The Most Great Name hath come with a sovereignty that neither the veils of the learned nor the clouds of the mystics could prevent. He calleth before all faces and summoneth all unto God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.”</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have seen in thy letter mention of him who was named Kazim in the Book of Names. We have remembered him in such wise as to cause the mountains, let alone the spirits, to soar. Verily, I am the All-Powerful, the Almighty. O Kazim! Hear the call of the Wronged One, then remember when the Promised One came with a manifest Book, how the people denied Him, turned away from Him, and disputed His verses, His proof, and His evidence, until they pronounced against Him a judgment at which the Supreme Pen was thunderstruck and the Lord of creation did lament. Thus was the matter decreed, and I am the All-Knowing Witness. O Kazim! Arise to serve My Cause with wisdom and utterance, and remind My servants of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My utterance, and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Say: Deprive not yourselves of the bounty of My days, nor your ears from hearkening to My verses, nor your hearts from My wondrous love. Say: This is the Day of proof, did ye but know it, and this is the Day whereon the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh, did ye but hear it. By God! The Treasure hath appeared and the Hidden One hath come with manifest sovereignty. Say: O people of the Bayan! Come ye, come ye! By what proof did ye believe in the Primal Point? Bring it forth, then read what hath been sent down from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. If ye deny the Revelation of God, His Cause, and the effects and influence of the Supreme Pen, by what cause was that which ye possess established? Be fair, and be not of the wrongdoers. Thus have We revealed unto thee the ocean of utterance with its waves, and the sun of proof with its lights, that thou mayest be of the thankful ones. If thou hast drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty and hast attained unto the lights of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! From Thy most sweet call my heart hath taken flight, and from the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen my limbs have trembled, and from the lights of Thy Most Great Throne and Thy mighty News my senses have been transformed, and the eyes of my outer and inner being have shed tears. I beseech Thee by the blood of Thy lovers and the sighing of those who long for Thee, and by the cry of those who have sought the supreme heights and the ultimate goal but have not attained them, to assist Thy servants to turn unto Thee and to behold that which Thou hast manifested through Thy power and Thy might. Then write down for them, O God of the world and Creator of the nations, that which shall profit them in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Most Great Book! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad before Rahim, and remind him of Thy verses whereby every moldered bone was quickened, by which the dwellers of the graves arose, the mountains were moved, the Cry was raised, the Trump was blown, and all who are in the heavens and on earth were thunderstruck. O Rahim! Verily mercy hath encompassed and preceded existence, yet the people comprehend not. The Self-Subsisting hath come, yet the people know not. That which was hidden in the treasuries of God’s protection, thy Lord, hath been made manifest, yet the people turn away therefrom. Say: Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye commit what the people of the Furqan committed. Cast away your vain imaginings; the Sun of Certitude hath risen with lights that have illumined the horizons. Fear God, then be fair in this Cause at whose appearance the Dove warbled upon the highest branches. He Who was hidden hath come with a sovereignty that neither ranks nor multitudes can withstand. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto those who have turned with their hearts unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Aqa Rida: O Rida! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord and arise to aid His Cause, the irrevocable, the forbidden. The Self-Subsisting hath come, yet the people have cast behind their backs His covenant and testament. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they know not. Blessed is the face that hath turned unto the lights of the Countenance, and the heart that hath turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Aqa Siyyid Muhammad Khurasani: O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad, that the remembrance and utterance may attract him to the horizon of the All-Merciful and cause him to remember his Lord, the Possessor of all existence. O Muhammad! Behold and remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, how He was treated by those who denied God’s right and His verses, following every rejected learned one. The divines of idols and the doctors of the Torah and Gospel denied Him, and there befell Him that which caused the sacred vale and the Concourse on High to weep. Thus was the matter decreed aforetime, yet the people know not. Remember thy Lord amongst His servants, then aid Him with the hosts of utterance. This is what We have commanded all in Our inscribed Tablet.</p>
<p>Aqa Siyyid Abdul-Rahim: O Abdul-Rahim! The Great Announcement hath come and maketh mention of thee from this exalted station, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. When the Promised One came, idolatrous servants denied Him and arose in opposition until they pronounced judgment against Him with such injustice as caused those nigh unto God to lament. Blessed is he who hath fulfilled God’s covenant and testament, and woe unto him who hath turned away from His extended path.</p>
<p>Mulla Ali Dhakir: O Ali, O Dhakir! Hearken unto the call of the Remembered One. He remembereth thee with that which cannot be equaled by treasures and riches. By My remembrance all things were attracted, and by My call the near ones sought My glorious station. When My sweetest call attracteth thee and the rustling of My Most Exalted Pen seizeth thee, arise, turning toward My Most Glorious Horizon, and say:</p>
<p>O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven! I beseech Thee by the breathings of Thy revelation, by the manifestations of Thy power and sovereignty, by the dawning-places of Thy knowledge and the daysprings of Thy wisdom, and by the Most Exalted Word whereby Thou hast subdued the kingdom of earth and heaven, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause, and speaking in Thy praise in such wise that neither the neighing of steeds nor the clashing of swords shall deter me. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Compassionate.</p>
<p>=== END BH00100 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00101 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of Our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise of those who praise, thanksgiving of those who give thanks, and glorification of those who glorify - how can these be attributed to Him Who is sanctified and exalted above creation, knowledge and comprehension? The inability of all things to reach Him testifies to His sanctity, and the confession and acknowledgment of both the visible and hidden tongues of all created things and beings bears eloquent witness to His transcendence. Who can describe Him as He deserves to be described? Who can mention Him as He deserves to be mentioned? The remembrances of those who remember are bounded by limitations, and the comprehension of those who comprehend falls short and is veiled.</p>
<p>O God, O Self-Sufficient One! By what utterance shall I make mention of Thee, and with what tongue shall I praise Thee? The Prophets and Chosen Ones have confessed their powerlessness, and likewise both the distant and the near, the obedient and the rebellious - all acknowledge their impotence and shortcoming. The essence of expression is mute in the arena of Thy praise, and the reality of speech is dumb in the court of Thy mention. Yet the ocean of Thy generosity has given hope to the realm of utterance, and the banner of Thy bounty has confirmed existence, that they might not remain utterly deprived of Thy mention according to their capacity. For were the door of Thy remembrance and praise to be shut, hope would vanish and the sword of despair would cut down and uproot the saplings of existence.</p>
<p>O Merciful One! We beseech from the ocean of Thy mercy. O Generous One! We implore from the sun of Thy generosity. Look not upon our weakness and lowliness; consider rather Thine exaltation, transcendence, grace and power. Perchance Thou wilt transform this handful of dust into a precious jewel, and set this cold world ablaze with the fire of Thy Tree. Thou art the Powerful. There is no God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the Most High.</p>
<p>And then, O beloved of my heart! The noble pages thou didst send, each one a volume from the world of inner meanings, arrived. Their words refreshed the soul, and the fire of their mention transformed languor and stillness into attraction and motion, for each letter was adorned with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and spoke His praise. Blessed art thou! It was not passion that made thee speak, but rather divine guidance. Were the servants to be fair and to see and hear with penetrating eyes and attentive ears, disputes and contentions would disappear, and “Our Cause is but one” would unveil its countenance and become manifest. But the servants have been reared on vain imaginings and have drunk from the pool of idle fancies; therefore they are deprived of the four, nay the nine rivers. Leave them to their devices. In any case, after reading the letter and becoming aware of it, the spirit ascended on the wings of detachment until it reached the presence of God’s throne, the Lord of all worlds. And after attaining the presence and receiving permission, thy letter was presented in its entirety, and these verses were revealed from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of all men, exalted be His blessed and transcendent utterance:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaks in the Kingdom of Utterance […]</p>
<p>Praise be befitting and worthy of the Lord of the Worlds Who, through the Dayspring of His signs and the Manifestation of His clear tokens, alone summoned all the peoples of the world to the choice sealed wine. His irrevocable Decree remained unhidden by doubts and untainted by idle fancies. From the horizon of each of His words shineth forth the light of certitude and blazeth the fire of true knowledge. These light and fire outwardly differ yet inwardly are united. Blessed is he who hath attained unto them both. Today, attentive ears hear from the Blessed Tree that which Moses heard on the Mount of Certitude, and perceiving eyes behold that which the Prophets and Messengers sought after. Exalted is this Day and exalted is He Who hath appeared therein. The former cannot be compared with previous cycles and ages, nor can the latter be likened to any previous revelation of God’s Word, the Dayspring of lights.</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be My glory! The Wronged One hath heard thy call and answered thee time and again with that wherewith God hath illumined the cities of knowledge and wisdom and the horizons of hearts and minds, and through which the river of mercy hath flowed amongst all created things. O Muhammad, hearken once again unto the Call from the precincts of ’Akka, from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He remembereth him who remembereth Him, nay rather, He remembereth him who wisheth to remember Him, for His remembrance preceded the world even as His mercy preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Most Great Announcement remembereth thee from this supreme horizon, which God hath made a prison for the Dayspring of His signs and the Dawning-place of His clear tokens, and for such of His servants, drawn nigh unto Him, as were not hindered by veils from the Lord of all beings, nor were they frightened by the hosts of the oppressors. We were walking in the house on a dark night when the servant present entered with thy letter and presented it before the Wronged One. We have answered thee with this clear Book which speaketh before the faces of all mankind. By God! The Most Great Name hath come with a sovereignty before which the power of kings and rulers cannot stand, and He desireth to purify the hearts of all peoples from rancor and hatred. For this He hath borne in the world of creation such afflictions and hardships as none knoweth save God, the Lord of all worlds. He counseleth the princes of the earth to justice and equity and to that whereby their stations shall be made manifest before the faces of the servants. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call and acted according to that which he was commanded by an All-Knowing Commander.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Remind the people of God’s verses with joy and fragrance. Verily they attract them, draw them near, make them know, and guide them to this Straight Path. The wolves have surrounded God’s sheep, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. The son of the wolf hath devoured sheep from My flock in the land of ?ad on this Day whereon the Caller proclaimeth from the highest horizon of the world: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.” Were ye to count the martyrs in My path, ye could not number them. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this, yet most of the people are among the deniers. They have denied God’s proof and evidence and cast His Book behind their backs. Lo! They are among the transgressors. This is a Day wherein the heaven hath come with manifest smoke, and the people have been prevented from turning to My most glorious horizon and from drawing nigh unto this resplendent station. By God! The smoke hath appeared as a recompense for their deeds. Lo! They are among the abased ones. Say: On the first day when the Most Exalted Pen moved, the Most Glorious Paradise trembled with joy, and the tribes of the earth who cast away God’s Covenant and His Command were shaken, having followed every remote pretender. Thus hath the Pen revealed its secrets and that which was treasured therein, that it might give the people glad tidings of this mighty and wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His favors! Verses have been revealed of such magnitude that none can encompass them - they have encircled the world. Yet most remain veiled until now. The words of old have not departed from the view of those who turn away among the people of the Bayan - they speak with fabricated words of the past and cling to manifestations of vain imaginings. How far is the glory, loftiness and greatness of this Cause from the understanding of those heedless souls! They are deprived of the heavenly waters of divine mercy, and are content with bitter hatred. Such is the condition of these people. Calumnies have arisen such that the world’s hearing has recoiled from its power to listen. Any person of justice and fairness who contemplates the verses revealed in this Most Great Manifestation will know with absolute certainty that the Hidden Being has been granted authority. The polytheists and transgressors strive with utmost effort to extinguish the divine light and quench the heavenly fire. But the Word of God has not been and will not be prevented from penetrating. Assuredly those possessed of vision, hearing and utterance will arise and summon humanity to the supreme horizon with the most exalted call. Indeed, nearness and remoteness, acceptance and rejection, death and life, ignorance and knowledge are all dependent upon and connected to the recompense of the deeds of the servants. Thus at the beginning of the Manifestation of the Herald, that is the Point of the Bayan, not one of the renowned divines of Persia attained to the light of recognition. The cause and reason was the recompense of deeds which became a barrier and deprived all. Would that they had held fast to repentance and return! They utter the blessed words “There is no power nor strength save in God,” yet they turn away from its appearance and meaning. They say “O Imam!” while issuing decrees against His Creator. In truth, astonishment itself is astounded at the deeds and words of this group. Say: O my God, my God! I testify that through Thy Most Great Name the ocean of generosity has surged, and through Thy binding command the sun of bounty has shone forth from the horizon of the world. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity and Sovereign of nations, by the mysteries hidden in all things, by the breaths of Thy most great verses, and by Thy sovereignty which has encompassed earth and heaven, to assist those who turn away to turn towards Thee, the deniers to confess, the oppressors to justice and fairness, and the rebellious to return to the ocean of Thy forgiveness and the heaven of Thy bestowals. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. That which was hidden from hearts and eyes has in this Manifestation become manifest and evident. Can the whisperings of corrupt souls now prevent the servants from reaching the shore of the sea of oneness? From the deeds and behavior of the Shi’ih on the Day of Judgment was revealed that which had been concealed for twelve hundred years. Until now they have not ceased - continuously from pulpits they revile and kill the Truth and His loved ones. Glory be to God! In these days an event has occurred that has caused astonishment. One of those who turned away from the Bayan, Mirza Hadi Dawlat-Abadi, merely upon hearing that in the land of Sad he had been called a Babi, that unjust one ascended the pulpit and, like the Shi’ih, uttered curses, revilement and abuse - first against his own guide in Cyprus and those in Cyprus, and then from the beginning until now against all. Glory be to God! What that unjust one has done for the sake of two days of life! But he is content with the foolish ones of the world who accept whatever he says. For example, if he mentions that his purpose in cursing […]</p>
<p>From the beginning until now they have reviled all. Glory be to God! What hath that unjust one wrought for the sake of two days of mortal life! Yet he is confident of the world’s foolish ones, who will accept whatsoever he sayeth. For instance, should he state that his purpose in cursing and reviling was something else, those possessed of vain imaginings would accept it. Say: O ye objectors to the Bayan, what is the distinction between truth and falsehood? Judge fairly. In that land how many martyrs have sacrificed their lives in the name of the Goal of the worlds, and ye have all heard of them. The twin resplendent lights, that is, the two Husayns - upon them be the most glorious of all glory - of whom ye have heard, despite their wealth, glory and fortune, sacrificed their lives in the path of the Friend. And though the wicked ones strove mightily that they might utter but one word to save themselves, they would not consent. They forsook creation and all that pertaineth unto it, but forsook not the truth. Likewise before them, Mulla Kazim and other souls - upon them be the most glorious glory of God - all freely sacrificed their lives at the threshold of the Friend. And several months ago His Holiness Ashraf - upon him be the glory of God and His grace - attained the most great martyrdom. His martyrdom is proof of certitude, steadfastness and confession, while the life of Hadi is evidence of wavering and denial. Judge fairly, O people of the Bayan, and speak with pure truthfulness, and conceal not the truth through your idle fancies. Until now it hath never happened that a Babi would confess and yet remain alive, while the unjust Hadi preferred mortal life to eternal life. Yet assuredly with one lie he will quiet those possessed of vain imaginings. Alas, alas, for their lack of fairness, their tyranny and their oppression! By the life of our Beloved and our Goal! Today it would be fitting to establish a house of mourning in the arena of the world and, in lamentation for justice and fairness, to recite those exalted verses which have been sent down from the heaven of will specifically for the dead. O people of ?ad! Hearken unto the counsel of this servant. Take for yourselves a path unto God. Ye have not been and are not informed of matters. Now ye have become entangled with souls who in the earliest days were occupied in building the cities of idle fancy with the hands of vain imaginings. Fear God, O people, and be not among the transgressors.</p>
<p>As for the mention that was made of ’Ali Pasha KH-A - upon him be the glory of God - last week a most mighty and holy Tablet was revealed and sent specifically for him, that it might reach that loved one through those who would deliver it. Now too is he mentioned in the Most Holy Court, and the tongue of grandeur speaketh these exalted words - glorified and exalted be His utterance: “O ’Ali! Upon thee be My glory! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One and arise with wisdom to aid the Cause. By the life of God! There hath been ordained for the helper that which the treasures of the earth cannot equal. Say: O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee to assist me in that which will abide with me in every world of Thy worlds and by which the cities of Thy justice will be illumined. O my Lord! Thou seest Thy servant who hath turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee, and who testifieth to his servitude unto Thee. I beseech Thee not to withhold him from the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy generosity. Thou art verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.” Thus was it ended.</p>
<p>O Rustam, upon thee be My greetings! Ponder upon that which hath been aforetime and that which hath appeared thereafter, and behold with the eye of insight, purely for the sake of God. The decline of true knowledge and wisdom hath ever been caused by the divines. Reflect upon the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. Though He proclaimed the blessed Word of Divine Unity, they issued the decree for His death. All peoples arose in opposition, and ponder thou the cause of their opposition. When thou discoverest this, thou wilt hold fast unto this Most Great Revelation with such firmness that all the earth shall be powerless to deter thee. Likewise consider the Manifestation of the Friend of the All-Merciful in ancient times, and thereafter the appearance of the Spirit, and before Him the Interlocutor. One they called a sorcerer, and another they named an impostor. Examine what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Never came there unto them a Messenger but they did mock Him.” After reflecting upon what hath been mentioned, arise and turn towards the Kaaba of God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O my God, my God! Thou seest how I have cast aside all else but Thee and have taken hold of Thy Cause, have forsaken all save Thee, turning unto the court of Thy grace and the sanctuary of Thy glory. I beseech Thee to assist me in rending asunder the veils and dispelling the mists. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. O Lord! Illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and my sight with the radiance of the Day-Star of Thy Revelation. O Lord! Withhold me not from the ocean of Thy verses and the sun of Thy grace. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>[The remainder of the text appears to be about various administrative matters and individual tablets being sent to different believers, and does not appear to be part of the main revelation.]</p>
<p>O Mirza Aqa! With manifest certitude the foundation of vain imaginings hath this day been rolled up by the command of the Lord of Days, and the carpet of certitude hath been spread. Strive thou that perchance with utmost joy and delight thou mayest illumine with the lights of certitude those who have lost their way in the valley of doubt and conjecture. The tongue was created for mention and praise, and these days are in truth the springtime of utterance. We beseech God to aid thee to purify hearts and souls from vain imaginings and idle fancies. Vain imaginings have debarred and deprived the world from the Lord of all beings. Whenever a light appeared, they strove to extinguish it, and whenever the Sun of Justice shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of grace, they endeavored like clouds and mists to conceal it. Most of the verses of the divine Books have testified and do testify to that which hath been mentioned. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One and with the finger of detachment rend asunder the veils and shrouds of the people - yet with wisdom and utterance, for the decree of the sword and spear hath been lifted. By the life of God! The utterance that proceedeth from the tongues of them that are detached is sharper than the sword and more penetrating than the spear. Say: O my God, my God! I testify that Thou didst remember me in Thy Most Great Prison when I was silent in Thy remembrance. I beseech Thee to aid me to serve Thy Cause. O my Lord! Illumine my sight, strengthen my heart, and reinforce my hearing and my limbs to that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. Thou art verily the All-Powerful, the Almighty, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Asadabad. His exalted Word: Should God will it, He would change its name to Nurabad. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the friends of that land. Praise be to God, they have been and are among the triumphant ones. That which is the cause of eternal life and everlasting existence was specially revealed for them before and after.</p>
<p>This servant hath also mentioned this to His Holiness the Name of Bounty, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God. Let them investigate and send copies of whatever was revealed concerning them and has been lost. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Haji Fadlu’llah and Kaka Khan, upon them be the Glory of God, and likewise of Haji’s love for the prayer of Salat. In truth, were all the world to attain unto a drop from the ocean of fairness, they would sacrifice their wealth and lives to obtain it. Today the taste of the servants hath changed and their power of comprehension hath been altered, therefore they are deprived of understanding that which hath descended from the heaven of bounty. O my brother and my true friend! The diverse winds of the world and its colors have stirred up impediments and deprived the sense of smell from perceiving the fragrances of revelation. We beseech God to assist His loved ones to educate mankind, that through the hosts of refined and noble utterances and praiseworthy deeds and character they may guide people to the divine law. Verily He is the Near One, verily He is the Watchful, verily He is the Helper.</p>
<p>Concerning Aqa Siyyid Aziz-i-Quli and those with him, upon them be the Glory of God, mention was made. After being presented before His face, these exalted words were specially revealed for them. His blessed and exalted Word: He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing[…]</p>
<p>O dear one! Every soul that hath in this day attained unto the recognition of this Most Great Announcement hath attained unto the glory of God and is illumined by the light of God. The glory of this world hath been and ever will be ephemeral, and likewise the clamor and differences of the peoples. But this most exalted and blessed Word, which hath in this hour dawned from the horizon of the Supreme Pen, is everlasting and enduring. Neither shall obliteration seize it, nor shall extinction find it. Give thanks unto the Peerless Beloved that He hath remembered thee in the Most Great Prison and adorned thee with the tokens of the Supreme Pen. He Who loved Me hath mentioned thee; We have remembered thee in this Clear Tablet. Convey My greetings to the loved ones in that land and its surroundings, both those related and others, and say: I swear by the effulgences of the lights of the Sun of Truth that this blessed Day hath no peer or likeness. Strive ye, and through unity illuminate all regions. Beware lest the darkness of the world prevent you from drawing nigh unto the Light, or tyranny from justice, or oppression from equity. The loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, must, with pure and holy hearts, sanctified from all directions, beseech and implore from God that which is the cause of the return of all and the means of salvation for all. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful and the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth. There is none other God but Him, the King, the Just, the Manifest Truth.</p>
<p>And as for the mention that was made of Dawlatabad and the loved ones of that land, upon them be the Glory of God, and likewise their steadfastness and attraction - mention of each and every one was made in the most exalted heights in the presence of the Lord of all beings, and these wondrous and blessed verses were revealed from the heaven of bounty and mercy. His word, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that place! Your names have been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, whereupon the ocean of My loving-kindness surged, the fragrances of My grace were wafted, and the sun of My utterance shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty. We have remembered you with such remembrance that through it the call of all things was raised: “God, there is none other God but Him, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, the Master of the Day of Judgment.” Blessed are ye, and again blessed are ye, for having turned towards Him from Whom all on earth have turned away, save those whom God, the Lord of all worlds, has willed. Ye have attained unto the traces of God from aforetime, which nothing can equal. We beseech God to strengthen you in that which will cause your deeds, your remembrances, and your character to endure in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. We have heard your call and have answered you, and We have shone upon you with the lights of utterance that ye may draw near, under all conditions, unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O friends of God! Hearken in the Persian tongue: Hold fast to unity and harmony. Great is this Day, and the Cause of God hath appeared like the sun from its horizon and is manifest. Hold fast to consultation and occupy yourselves with teaching. This is the assistance that hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Tablets of the past and future. Hold fast unto it and be of them that render assistance.</p>
<p>O friends of God and His party! Hear the call from the direction of Akka, from the Sublime Tree upraised in truth. Verily it illumineth your hearts, strengtheneth your frames, confirmeth you and aideth you with the hosts of utterance. He, verily, is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>We beseech God to grant strength that all may arise with supreme steadfastness and firm certitude to turn towards the cities of hearts and minds. Let not time slip away, and hearken unto the sincere counsels of them that are detached. Should any differences appear among you, strive to remove and efface them, that ye may attain true unity and be numbered among the helpers. The handmaidens of God have been mentioned at this time in the Crimson Book by the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to preserve the leaves of the Tree from the various winds of the world and to illumine each one with the light of steadfastness and the radiance of detachment. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Him, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>[The letter continues with mention of various individuals and specific counsel to them…]</p>
<p>The Most Exalted Pen has willed to make mention of the elevated Nowruz Ali. Today is Nowruz and in truth it is the sight of all days, nay the sight by which the world is illumined. The realm of time cannot equal a single hour thereof. O Nowruz! Thou art in the highest companionship, inasmuch as the Lord of all beings hath made mention of thee. We made mention of thee before thy ascension and after thy ascension, that the grace and favors might encompass thee from all directions. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing Rememberer. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who have ascended unto God, holding fast to the cord of love and recognition. He is verily the Compassionate, the Generous. We make mention of the children in this exalted station. We beseech God to aid them to remain steadfast with such constancy that neither the opposition of the opposers nor the hosts of the oppressors shall deter them. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Mahmud! Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and We have mentioned thee with these sublime words. For divine mention there have been and are infinite degrees and stations. Among these, when a single word proceedeth from the Most Exalted Pen specifically for someone, at that moment there appear in the most exalted Paradise and the supreme Heaven lofty and transcendent stations consisting of mansions, dwellings, chambers and endless new bounties, to such an extent that those who enumerate, remember and record are unable to count them. Consider the grace and favors of God and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the hearts of the sincere ones and those near unto God! We beseech God to set thee ablaze with the fire of His love, that through the warmth of love thou mayest ignite the souls in that land. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Each of the souls mentioned attained unto that which had been the hope of the world from time immemorial. The divine Books speak of this Day, and all the Prophets and Messengers held fast unto it, beseeching and hoping from God the meeting of this blessed Day. Blessed is the soul that hath turned unto Him and attained unto steadfastness.</p>
<p>Now, for each of the petitioners specifically, a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent in reply, including those of his honor V.Z., his honor Haji Mirza Hassan, his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Ali Sar, his honor Aqa Siyyid Sharif, and his honor Sulayman Kh.A., upon them be the glory of God, as well as the other loved ones upon whom be the glory of God who were mentioned before. Praise be to God, all have received their portion from the ocean of utterance of the Goal of all worlds, and there was revealed specifically for each that which all on earth cannot equal. God willing, may the loved ones drink from the chalices of words that which bestoweth eternal life. Verily our Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And as for the mention they made of his honor Haji Kazim, upon him be the glory of God, and the mention of his house which has become a gathering place for the friends of God, and likewise the mention of his vision - these matters were presented before the throne of God, exalted be His glory, and one Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent from the heaven of utterance of the Goal of all worlds specifically for him. We beseech God to exalt him among His servants through His Name. Verily He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And likewise they wrote mentioning his honor Siyyid Bahlul, upon him be the glory of God. After being presented before His presence, these sublime words were revealed from the treasury of divine knowledge concerning him. His word, mighty is His utterance and manifest His proof:</p>
<p>He is the Speaker […]</p>
<p>O Muhammad, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Single, the One! All the friends have been and are mentioned before the Wronged One. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make them the banners of His remembrance, the standards of His guidance, the rivers of His mercy, and the trees of His loving-kindness amongst His servants and His creation, that all may partake of the fruits of the Divine Lote-Tree and attain unto that which they are heedless of today. On this day, every created thing doth proclaim with eloquent tongue and giveth glad-tidings unto all of the appearance of the Most Great Light. Blessed are they that hear, and woe unto the heedless!</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honour Siyyid B.H. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to give him to drink from the chalice of the Water of Life, that he may arise among the servants, speaking His praise, turning unto His horizon, standing firm in service to His Cause, and directing himself toward the lights of His countenance. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Say: This day is the Lord of days, with which neither years nor months, nay, neither centuries nor ages can compare. God willing, they will guide the servants through wisdom and utterance to the stream of the All-Merciful, that all may not be deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord in His days. His mercy hath preceded and His grace hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>This servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, to assist him in that which beseemeth His Day, that he may be a cup-bearer among the people through His Name, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Exalted is this mighty and sublime station!</p>
<p>Thus far doth the discourse end, and mention is concluded here for now, that God willing, the response to the remainder of the august letter may be sent later, as time is wanting at this moment and the bearer of news is departing. I convey greetings, peace, praise and glory to all the friends in that land and its surroundings, and I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to illumine all with the light of deeds and character, which are the cause of the order of the world and the progress of nations. Verily, He is the Illuminator Who illumineth whomsoever He willeth among His servants, and He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you and who hearken unto your words in praise of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O Heydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>In His Name Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance!</p>
<p>The Book of God speaketh the truth in this Most Great Prison and guideth the servants unto God, the Lord of all men. Not an atom escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Choosing. The Call hath never ceased from the Most Exalted Horizon, yet the people remain in strange heedlessness. They have cast the Truth behind their backs, clinging to the dawning-places of idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>O Heydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon thee be My everlasting Glory! That which thou didst send hath attained the ears of the Wronged One, and We have answered thee with that which hath caused the hearts of them who are endued with understanding to soar. Say: This is a Day wherein none save Him is to be mentioned. Fear God, O ye parties! The Tree of the Furthermost Boundary speaketh before your faces, and the Euphrates of Utterance floweth from the Pen of God, the Lord of lords. Neither the might of the world hath weakened Him, nor have the swords of the nations frightened Him. He hath arisen before all with such steadfastness as hath caused feet to slip.</p>
<p>Say: This is a Call round which circle the essences of existence, and this is a Tablet which God hath made the point of circumambulation for all scriptures and tablets. Say: Fear God, O peoples of the earth, and withhold not yourselves from the Most Great Ocean, nor follow every heedless doubter. This is a Day wherein the ocean surgeth and the fragrance wafteth. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of God, the Lord of mankind. This is a Day wherein the Ancient Beauty hath established Himself upon the Most Great Throne and the Herald hath proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>Verily, in the midst of tribulations, We call unto Our loved ones who heard the Call and said: “Yea, yea, O Lord of earth and heaven!” Blessed art thou for having traveled throughout the lands to spread the signs of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. We heard thy mention when thou wast in the Verdant Land, in a house wherein My remembrance and praise were raised by those who took hold of the Book of God with such power as the might of the world could not frustrate, and with such strength as all the hosts of the earth combined could not withstand. To this doth the Lord of the world bear witness from His most exalted station.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in the Verdant Land! Ye have attained unto acceptance on a Day wherein most of the servants have turned away, and ye have found the breezes of revelation whilst the people were wrapped in heedlessness and error. We have mentioned you aforetime through clear verses and have revealed unto you that which hath attracted the hearts and gladdened the eyes. Blessed are ye for having fulfilled My Covenant, attained unto My testimonies, and drunk the choice wine of utterance from the chalice of My bounty. We beseech God to assist you with the hosts of the seen and the unseen, to send down upon you from the clouds of grace the rains of blessing and bounty, and to ordain for you from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall profit you in every world of His worlds. Verily, He knoweth you better than ye know yourselves. He is the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Convey My remembrance to him who was named Muhammad before Husayn. We testify that he attained to what was mentioned in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. We found him steadfast in this Cause which hath caused all regions to be seized with perturbation. He hath drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My utterance. We have remembered him in diverse Tablets and We beseech God to exalt him through His Name amongst His servants, to make him a champion of His Cause, firm in His service, and to manifest through him that which shall endure as long as His names endure. Give him glad-tidings from Me, remind him of My verses, and illumine him with the lights of the Kingdom of My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Khidra, inasmuch as God hath made thee a repository of the pearls of His love and the arena for the steeds of His might and power. Thus hath the Kawthar of utterance flowed from the Pen of God, the Lord of all worlds. God hath adorned Khidra with him who loved Me and who arose in the early days to make mention of Me, to praise Me, and to serve My firm and wise Cause. We have aided him, confirmed him, illumined him with the light of My knowledge, and adorned him with the ornament of My Name whereby the hearts of the Concourse on High were attracted and the limbs of the idolaters trembled.</p>
<p>We wish to make mention at this time of him who was named Muhammad after Mirza and give him the glad-tidings of My attention to him and My remembrance of him, that supreme joy may seize him through this Great News. The Wronged One in prison remembers thee with that whereby thy name shall endure in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Muhammad! Be thou assured that the world and all that is therein cannot equal the Word of God, for it shall remain immortalized in His mighty and wise Book. Arise, then turn to the Kaaba of divine knowledge and say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having remembered me when I was among the heedless ones. We heard thy call and answered thee, and when We saw the warmth of thy love, We revealed to thee what the Tree of Utterance revealed unto the Son of Imran on the Mount of Knowledge. Be grateful and say: Praise be to Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Cling not to names as did the people before you. Fear God and be not of the idolaters. This is the Day of God wherein none save Him is mentioned. Have mercy upon yourselves and be not of the wrongdoers. The ocean of divine knowledge surgeth before your faces. Turn to it with illumined hearts and radiant faces. This is what ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We testify that thou hast drunk the milk of divine knowledge from the breast of utterance and believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed. We make mention of thy brethren who responded when they heard My sweetest call and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered for My Self, which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who heard, hastened, and responded when the call was raised between earth and heaven. These are the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark, mention of which was sent down in the Book of Names by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>In this station We make mention of him who was named Mirza Aqa in the Most Exalted Horizon, as a favor from God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, that the breezes of revelation may attract him and bring him nigh unto the station adorned with supreme steadfastness in this Great Announcement. Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of the Prison of Akka, which hath been raised to such heights that the denizens of the Kingdom and above them the Concourse of Glory - whom the tempests of the calumnies of those who turned away from this luminous Horizon could not move - have heard it. Arise to serve the Cause with a power that the hosts of the oppressors cannot weaken. We have made mention of thee and those who believed before and at this time with this clear remembrance. Convey My greetings to thy brethren and illumine them with the lights of the Sun of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to assist them as befitteth His glorious and wondrous Day. Grieve not at the vicissitudes of the world, its conditions and changes. Take hold of the hem of thy Lord’s mercy and say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having adorned me with the ornament of turning unto Thee and for having illumined me with the light of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and the manifestations of Thy power amongst all beings to aid me and my brethren to serve Thy Cause with wisdom and utterance. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the Bestower. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>This is the Manifest Book that speaketh at this time. This is a Day wherein the Call calleth out, the Word speaketh, and the Book uttereth, yet most of the people are heedless. The sleep of heedlessness hath overtaken them such that this most sweet Call, raised from the Most Exalted Horizon in the Prison of Akka, hath not awakened them. Blessed is he who hath heard and recognized, who hath seen and witnessed, and who hath stood firm in this Great Announcement. Say: This is an Announcement the like of which the eye of creation hath not seen, nor the ear of invention heard. He is the Incomparable One of the heavens and earth. To this beareth witness His Revealer and His Manifestation in this exalted station.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Hearken unto the Call of the Eternal God. Verily it hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon that His servants in the kingdom of creation might hear it, yet the people turned away until they denied God’s proof and evidence, and disbelieved in His favor which He sent down from the heaven of His bounty and the kingdom of His mercy that embraceth all in the heavens and earth. He who loved Me and soared in My atmosphere hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee with that which all the treasures of the world and all the riches of the earth cannot equal. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and insight-possessing one. Hear My call and arise to serve My Cause with a steadfastness whereby the feet of the servants shall stand firm. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Knowing. Cause My servants to enter, in My name, the paradise of My good-pleasure and the garden of My knowledge. Verily thy Lord is the All-Explaining, the All-Wise. The clamor hath been raised in all regions, and this is what the Supreme Pen foretold when it moved in Zawra and in this Great Prison. Arise to serve the Cause, then guide the people to the path of God Who walketh and speaketh in this palace which was built for this Most Luminous and Great Manifestation.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory! It hath dawned from the horizon of utterance, speaking and making mention of this Name at Whose appearance the limbs of the tribes trembled, save those whom God, thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, willed. Beware lest the oppression of tyrants frighten thee or the might of Pharaohs prevent thee. The world shall perish, and that which hath been sent down to thee from My Most Exalted Pen at this glorious and wondrous time shall endure. Take My Book with My strength, then read it among My servants who have not broken My covenant and My testament, and among those who have sought the ultimate goal and the highest summit, that the fragrances of revelation may guide them to the purpose of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When thou hast drunk the choice wine of My utterance and found the fragrance of My pure wine, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Aid me in that which beseemeth Thee and Thy days. Then reinforce me with Thy exalted hosts whom Thou hast created for the triumph of Thy Cause, the diffusion of Thy signs, and the manifestation of that which draweth them nigh unto Thee in all conditions. O Lord! Thou beholdest me clinging to Thy Most Great Handle and holding fast to the hem of Thy mercy, O Lord of all beings. I beseech Thee to assist me to manifest that which Thou hast commanded me with spirit and joy. Then ordain for me the reward of those who have circled round Thy Sacred House and acted in accordance with that which they were bidden in Thy Mighty Book. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee to manifest through me the pearls of Thy love and knowledge which lay hidden within my innermost being by Thy command and will. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have desired at this moment to make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Ja’far, brother of the one who ascended unto the horizon of My loving-kindness, that he may rejoice and be of those who are thankful. We have made mention of those who have turned, on the Day of God, unto His luminous horizon, and We counsel all with that which We counseled Our chosen ones and loved ones aforetime who neither denied My proof and My testimony, nor turned away from My Cause, the manifest, the shining, the wondrous. Let not the deeds of those who have denied God grieve thee, nor the utterances of any heedless and remote one. Turn with thy whole being to the Kaaba of God and say:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! All glory be unto Thee for having manifested Thy Cause amongst Thy servants, and all praise be unto Thee for having guided them to the horizon of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy Sacred Tree whereby the hearts of Thy servants have been drawn to the horizon of Thy manifestation, and by the light of Thy countenance whereby all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth have been illumined, to enable me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee amongst Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Strong, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Lord! Withhold not Thy servants from turning unto the court of Thy nearness, and deprive them not of the outpourings of Thy days. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and in Thy grasp are the reins of every clear command.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon Mine horizon and standeth before My face! We have desired to make mention of Our loved ones in Nishabur, whom thou didst mention before and whose names thou didst send to the Most Great Prison before the face of thy Lord, the All-Knowing Remembrancer. By the life of God! The Wronged One hath sent down for His loved ones that which no books in the world can equal, whereunto every fair-minded and perceiving one doth testify. O My loved ones in that place! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One Who mentioned you before through clear verses, and at this time through that which hath attracted the hearts of the sincere ones. Be not grieved by the happenings of the world and what hath befallen you in your love for God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. In the Persian tongue hear ye the divine call. Ye have ever been remembered and still are. Today the Sun of Revelation is shining and manifest before all faces, and the ocean of utterance is visible and evident with countless waves. All must, with wisdom and utterance, bestow a portion from the sea of awareness upon them that slumber and guide them to the supreme horizon. I beseech God to aid the loved ones of that land in that which leadeth to salvation and nearness. Each one of the friends hath in truth borne in God’s path that which hath caused the Concourse on High to marvel. They must preserve this most exalted and most high station in the name of the Lord of all humanity. The barking ones, the idolaters and the thieves stand ready at their posts of ambush, and have had and have no purpose save to lead the servants astray. The counsels of the Point, and His lamentations and expressions of grief, had no effect upon the people of the Bayan. By the life of God! They have risen in opposition in a manner without likeness or peer, as witnessed by that which hath issued from their mouths on this blessed, holy and luminous Day. In these days the opposers and deniers have desired to obliterate the Bayan. Glory be to God! All that was revealed by His Holiness and sent down from the heaven of will was and is circling round the Bayan. It is the perspicuous Book and the proof of God unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. In that Book mention hath been made of the return and the revelation and the mysteries of resurrection and the signs of the Hour. This Wronged One hath shown forth before the heedless deniers that which would prevent this reprehensible deed. We beseech God to aid His servants to uphold His signs and obliterate their signs. Verily He is powerful over all things. We send Our glorification and prayers upon Our loved ones there, and We beseech God to send down upon them from the heaven of grace and bounty that which will draw them nigh unto His all-glorious horizon and assist them to stand firm in this Cause, whereby the hearts of the heedless were troubled and the feet of the barking ones did slip. O Haydar-’Ali! Thou didst mention the seven brothers in the land of Kaf. Today the doors of divine favor have been opened through the key of the Most Great Name and the river of the All-Merciful’s mercy is flowing. Each of the loved ones mentioned in thy letter hath been blessed with special favors, as witnessed by the waves of the ocean of My bounty and the effulgences of the sun of My loving-kindness. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this clear utterance and this great bounty. The deed which today taketh precedence over all deeds is steadfastness in the Cause of God - this hath been and still is so. Implore God that He may aid all to achieve this deed, which hath no equal. Verily He is the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! In My Name, the All-Glorious, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. This word hath been revealed and sent forth: O My Name! Dost thou weep for what hath befallen Me at the hands of the heedless ones, or do I weep for Mine own Self? By the life of God! The waves have encompassed the Ark of God, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting, and the winds have beset the Lamp of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. There hath befallen Me at the hands of those who claim to love Me worse than what hath befallen Me from Mine enemies. My lamentation, My outcry, My yearning, and My wailing bear witness to this.</p>
<p>Some have imagined that We sent you specifically to collect the Huquq in those regions. Glory be to God! No Huquq worthy of mention from the land of Kha has ever been presented before the face of this Wronged One. Previously, My Name Jamal, at the request of the King of Martyrs, upon him be My most glorious glory, proceeded to the land of Kha to collect the Huquq, and received one thousand, but it was not accepted. The Book of God, the Lord of the mighty throne, beareth witness to this. And it was ordained that the aforementioned one should return whatever funds he had received to their owners. Thereafter, the lamentation and sighing of My Name Jamal was raised. Thus, purely out of grace and favor, the funds from the land of Kha were accepted and bestowed upon the people of that region and other regions, and its record is presently with the servant.</p>
<p>Indeed, from Bushruyih and its surroundings, they have each year prepared and sent excellent leaves, which were truly adorned with the ornament of acceptance and illumined with the glory of His good-pleasure. If anything was or is accepted, it is through the favor of God, exalted be His glory. How blessed are those souls whose Huquq and gifts have been accepted! Sometimes some would mention funds they wished to send, but they were directed to distribute these among the poor themselves.</p>
<p>During this last journey when the Most Exalted Afnan and Amin set out for the Most Great Goal and the Supreme Summit, one of the loved ones, upon him be My glory, sent a sum specifically for the restoration of the House, but it was not accepted and its return was ordered. However, there was delay in this matter. Last year when Amin attained the presence, he mentioned that modesty prevented him from returning it, as the giver had sent the sum with utmost humility, submissiveness and love. For this reason, there was delay in its return. Thereafter, he besought forgiveness from the ocean of His Ancient Grace, and his prayer was answered. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist all to manifest pure sincerity and that which beseemeth His holy, mighty and wondrous Day.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! In these days the pilgrim house and the well-known gardens have all become the place, abode and dwelling of emigrants and travelers. This year, such gatherings have occurred that perhaps the government may object, though until now His Majesty the Sultan hath shown special consideration. We beseech God to exalt him through His Name among His servants and to aid him to uplift His Word in His earth. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>You mentioned the loved ones of Furugh. We beseech God once again to unite their hearts and assist them to achieve unity and harmony. It behooveth Mahmud to aid his Lord through the hosts of wisdom and utterance and to make known to them His straight path. We have previously made mention of him through verses that have set the world ablaze and by which the hearts of those who have turned unto God have been attracted.</p>
<p>O Mohsen! Thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One. Blessed art thou and blessed is he that is with thee. We beseech God to assist you to serve His Cause and to manifest from you that which will diffuse the fragrance of love and fellowship amongst His servants, and to gather you and My loved ones there around the table that hath been sent down unto you from the heaven of the bounty of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that land! Should anyone ask you about the Wronged One, say: Verily, He is under the claws of hatred, as attesteth to this He in Whose possession is the perspicuous Book. We desire naught but your unity and agreement concerning this Announcement at whose appearance the rustling of the Sidrat’ul-Muntaha was raised, crying out and saying: “He Who was hidden hath appeared, and He Who was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of lords, hath been made manifest.” Then the murmuring of the Kawthar of utterance was raised throughout all possibility: “The Kingdom and the Dominion belong to God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.” And the whispering of the breezes of the Dawn of Revelation: “The Sovereign hath come! The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of all men.” And the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen: “Glory and greatness, power and might belong to God, the Commander, from beginning to end.”</p>
<p>Verily this Day is great, great indeed, and this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. This hath been repeatedly uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur, yet some have manifested such opposition as caused the Lote-Tree to lament and the Eye of Justice to weep.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Forugh! Blessed are ye and blessed is he who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We counsel you to be patient and steadfast, and to that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Loving. All that hath befallen you hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet before God. Not an atom escapeth His knowledge, despite those who have denied this evident grace.</p>
<p>What have some souls understood from the all-embracing, decisive word “He doeth whatsoever He willeth”? The Point saith: “Were He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, or heaven to be earth, none hath the right to question why or wherefore.” And likewise He saith: “The entire Bayan is but a leaf among the leaves of His Paradise. Should He accept it, verily He is to be loved in His command, and should He reject it, verily He is to be obeyed in His decree.” In brief, the waves of this ocean are beyond reckoning.</p>
<p>Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Rida hath dwelt in this land for some time. We testify that he hath taken for himself a station beneath the canopies of grandeur. We send Our greetings upon him and those with him, and We beseech God to give them to drink from the cup of the Greater Steadfastness and to ordain for them that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure through the eternity of His names and attributes. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>You have mentioned the soil of Turbat [in your letter]. We beseech God to bless it and to manifest therein that which will draw its people nigh unto the precincts of holiness, nearness and glory. Verily, He is powerful to do what He willeth through His binding and irrevocable command. O My loved ones in Turbat! He who loveth Me hath made mention of you, and We make mention of you in this Tablet at an hour when the Day-Star of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s will, the Lord of the worlds. Time and again ye have heard the call, and this is yet another time, a mercy from Us, for verily I am the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have heard and turned towards Him, and have attained unto that which most of mankind hath been debarred from. To this beareth witness the Most Great Pen of God on this manifest Day. We counsel you to observe trustworthiness, which God hath made the supreme adornment of the temple of His servants, and to observe religion, without which no deed is acceptable. Thus hath the matter been decreed in My mighty Book. Let not the affairs of men and the happenings of the world grieve you. Cast away what the people possess and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Lord of the mighty Throne. We counsel you and Our loved ones again and again to be wise in speech and to perform such deeds as God hath made the hosts of victory and triumph in this mighty and impregnable Revelation. Hold fast unto wisdom, and likewise unto goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. These shall protect you and deliver you from every heedless one that is remote and every oppressor that is obstinate. This is the Day of God and great is His Cause. All must fix their gaze upon the horizon of His Manifestation alone, detached and freed from all else. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto this Most Great Remembrance and clung to the hem of God’s commandments, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. It is incumbent, nay obligatory, upon every soul to protect the servants, in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, from former vain imaginings, lest they be afflicted anew with that which would cause loss in this world and the next. Soon will the hidden mysteries that have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen become as manifest as the sun. Then shall the heedless be seen in manifest loss.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be the everlasting glory of God. Blessed be thy tongue for having uttered the mention of My loved ones, and thine ear for having heard their call and mention, and thy heart for having turned unto the One, the All-Informed. The loved ones of Zavih have ever been and continue to be remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. However, in these days sorrows from all directions have encompassed the blessed and eternal Tree, and from both parties there hath come to pass that which pen and ink are powerless to describe. This Wronged One, in all conditions, beseecheth God to guide all and adorn them with the ornament of truthfulness. This people have all been commanded to teach God’s Cause. This matter hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen in most Tablets, yet some have imagined that which hath caused the realm of assurance to lament and weep. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to purify His loved ones from idle fancies and vain imaginings, to draw them nigh unto Him, and to adorn them with that which will exalt them amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful. The men of those regions are all remembered and have attained the infinite bounties of God, exalted be His glory. I beseech Him to aid them all to stand firm with such constancy that neither the doubts of the doubtful nor the calumnies of the slanderers shall keep them back from the truth and the manifest light. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O esteemed one, upon whom be the Glory of God and His bounty! Thou didst make mention of certain loved ones who dwell in various cities and regions. We have made mention of some of these souls, and We beseech God to remove all hindering causes, that all may attain unto divine remembrance and celestial grace. The letter of that cherished friend proved most affecting; verily, every word thereof testified to manifest sincerity. We beseech God to aid and assist him in that which He loveth and is pleased with. From recent events may be gleaned somewhat of the grief of this Wronged One, and awareness may be gained thereof. Blessed are they who perceive and who reflect. Convey on behalf of this Wronged One greetings and glorification unto him, and say: O cherished one! Upon thee be the glory of God, His light, His might and His bounty. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee from His Most Exalted Pen every good thing that He hath revealed in His Perspicuous Book. We testify that thou hast attained unto the service of the Cause and hast attained His presence and hearkened unto the call of God, the Lord of all worlds, when He was imprisoned in the prison of Akka and wronged at the hands of the heedless.</p>
<p>Mention was made by thy pen of the loved ones of Faran. We testify that they have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon, detached from all that existeth in the world of creation, and hastened and traversed land and sea until they stood before the gate that was opened through this Most Great Name unto all who dwell on earth, and drank the choice wine of revelation from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. And We testify that they heard that for which ears were created to hear, and reached a station that God hath made the point of adoration for them that are nigh and them that are sincere. In these days there hath been specially sent down from the heaven of divine Will for each one that which draweth the servants nigh. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make them among those whom He hath described in His Perspicuous Book with His words: “honored servants who speak not until He hath spoken, and who do His bidding.”</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. Thy namesake, that is, he who standeth in service to the Cause, is occupied night and day in the remembrance and praise of God and in His service. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to preserve him through His bounty, to guard him with His hosts, to assist him with His sovereignty, and to exalt him through His Name amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things. We ask and beseech the True One to protect him from the whisperings of the polytheists, the liars, and the proud ones, for some have uttered that which testifieth to the heedlessness of the speaker. The very same delusions of the former sect have arisen; the difference is that with that sect it was after the passing of centuries and ages, while this sect desired to afflict the servants at the beginning of days. Verily, We were with him who spoke in delusion, and We concealed it. Verily, thy Lord is the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We hope that thy namesake and those who are with him, upon them be My glory, will protect the servants through the Name of the True One. This is not difficult for God. One of his services was that he sent the aforementioned expected countenance to the Most Holy Court, and for this deed there is ordained and recorded with God a great reward.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! Mention of thee and thy utterances reached Ba and Shin and the Best of Cities. The loved ones and leaves of that land have each year been blessed with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and specifically for each one there was sent down from the heaven of bounty that which neither time can erase nor change alter. Some time ago, from the heaven of the Will of the Ancient King and the Desire of the nations, holy and luminous tablets were revealed and sent for the loved ones and leaves of that land, and more shall be sent hereafter. They have ever been and continue to be beneath the glances of loving-kindness. Give them glad tidings from Me and illumine them with the lights of the kingdom of My wondrous utterance.</p>
<p>His honor Mir, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - all that he hath mentioned, both past and present, hath been illumined with the light of acceptance. In truth, he standeth firm in service to the Cause and is adorned with the light of steadfastness. The loved ones and leaves in the land of Ba and Shin and the Best of Cities have attained unto that which the treasures of earth and heaven cannot equal. Blessed are they that are certain, and blessed are they that act.</p>
<p>O thou who speakest in My Name! The petition of Hasan-i-Furughi, upon him be My glory, hath attained unto presence and hearing. Proclaim “God is Most Great” on My behalf before his face. Let him arise, turning toward the Supreme Horizon, and say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! Thou seest me advancing toward Thy Most Great Name, through which the limbs of the nations who denied Thy proof and Thy evidence, and turned away from Thy Manifestation and Thy signs, have trembled. I beseech Thee, O Originator of all created things and Quickener of all contingent beings, by the splendors of the Orb of Thy utterance and the outpourings of the ocean of Thy grace, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen the good of the Hereafter and of this world. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one knocking at the door of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him of that which Thou hast ordained for the near ones among Thy servants and the sincere ones among Thy creation. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.”</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabli-Haydar! They who have sought permission to attain Our presence from the ocean of divine bounty are all remembered at this time and are blessed with the effulgences of the Luminary of utterance, the Goal of all the worlds. However, granting permission in these days would be contrary to wisdom, for the gathering of the loved ones in the Desired Land has exceeded the bounds of moderation this year. The lovers and manifestations of longing must be calmed and made patient through kindly counsels and wise exhortations. God knows that this Wronged One has ever loved and continues to love the presence of His loved ones, yet obstacles have appeared from every direction. Therefore, purely out of grace and kindness, We have suspended permission until God brings about His decree. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Convey My greetings to My handmaiden who has lamented from separation and remoteness. We beseech God to aid her to be patient and steadfast, and to do what the wisdom of these days requires. Verily, He is the Munificent, the Generous.</p>
<p>O thou who drinkest the choice wine of My utterance! The mention of his honor Abdullah, upon whom rest My glory and loving-kindness, is the cause of greatest sorrow, for he was not treated with forbearance. Ask God to guide the commanding souls and confirm them in that which befits the days of God. In brief, there befell him that which caused sorrow to this Wronged One. That honored one has been with the Wronged One and has witnessed the waves of the ocean of knowledge, forbearance, patience and steadfastness. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to make souls aware of their station and rank, and to aid them to do what befits this blessed, mighty and wondrous Day. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those with thee, and upon those who have heard the call, have turned towards it and have said: “Here am I! Here am I! O Lord of all beings, Lord of the throne on high and of earth below, and Master of the last and the first!”</p>
<p>=== END BH00102 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00103 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise, glory, gratitude and honor befit the Lord of the Kingdom of Names, Who through His grace and bounty brought the world from nothingness into being, adorned it with the ornament of existence, and bestowed the gift of knowledge that all might attain to His recognition, which was the purpose of creation. Whosoever has attained to this station is adorned with such deeds and character as conduce to the reformation of the world and the tranquility of nations. Blessed are they whom the affairs of the world and its vicissitudes have not withheld from the Truth nor debarred from the divine path. These are the flowing rivers and the enduring stars; these are the dawning-places of goodness and the daysprings of benevolence. The servant beseecheth his Lord to strengthen them with His hosts, to protect them by His sovereignty, and to aid them through the signs of His victory. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>My God, my God! The servant beseecheth Thee, by the mysteries of Thy Divinity and the manifestations of Thy Lordship, and by Thy Command through which the flowers of Thy grace and bounty have sprung forth from the gardens of Thy glorious Oneness, that Thou protect Thy loved ones from the evil of every clamourer, every idolator, and every heedless one who hath turned away from Thy proof and evidence and violated Thy Covenant and Testament. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And then, O beloved of my heart! Thy exalted letters arrived one after another, each a straight path, a truthful and manifest proof, and for His Holiness the Trustworthy One a clear testimony and an eloquent witness. Through the grace of God he hath received and hath been granted the outward and inward bounty. A hundred thousand thanks to the Goal of all the worlds Who hath made His loved ones the manifestations of grace and favor, that they may not withhold from His servants love and mercy. In any case, after observing the first letter dated the ninth of the sacred month of Dhi’l-Qa’dah, numbered 2, We repaired to the Most Exalted Station and Supreme Summit, attaining the presence before the face of the Lord of all beings. This is what was sent down from the heaven of the grace of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. His blessed and exalted Word: “O Amin! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds! We have heard thy call and whatsoever thou didst mention hath attained the honor of being heard. The Supreme Pen hath ever mentioned and continueth to mention His loved ones. Know thou with evident certitude that none among the peoples of the earth except His loved ones are capable of hearing this Call which hath been raised from the Most Exalted Horizon. These heedless ones have been seized by the slumber of negligence to such extent that in the Mother Book they are accounted as dead. The world hath never witnessed itself adorned and illumined as in these days. O Amin! This is the Day concerning which He saith: ‘The whole earth shall be but His handful on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens shall be rolled together in His right hand.’ Do they appear worthy of recognition of this Most Exalted Station and Supreme Summit? The Primal Point declared ‘I am the first to worship Him,’ yet behold what they have said and what hath come to pass. Beseech God that He deprive not His servants of the lights of the Most Great Luminary. Glory be to God! Some of the handmaidens have appeared with the might of men, adorned with the ornament of knowledge and blessed with supreme steadfastness. He is the All-Bountiful and He is the Generous. Should a dried leaf from among the trees take precedence, it is, in the sight of God, preferred above those who sit upon the thrones of ordinances and recline upon the couches of commandments - that is, the divines of the earth and its jurisprudents. Alas! Alas! The wolf hath devoured and the serpent hath struck. Give thanks to the Goal of the world Who hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison and maketh mention of thee. This mention cannot be equaled by the pearls of all the seas nor matched by the jewels of kings. The ornaments of the world are not worthy of mention before Him. Blessed is My mention for which one hath sacrificed his life in My path. This is that mention concerning which He saith ‘The remembrance of God is the greatest.’ In all days and nights he uttereth mention of this Wronged One and is aware and informed of the tribulations that have befallen Him from the people of the Bayan and others. By the life of God! He hath lamented and wailed in the Garden of the Bayan and beseeched that perchance the people of the Bayan might not be sullied with the dust of idle fancies and might not cause grief to come upon the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen. Say: O ye who have turned away from the Face of God! Look with fairness and speak with justice. They have turned away from Him Who from the beginning of the Cause until now hath arisen before the faces of all and summoned all without any veil, and have turned to the dawning-place of vain imaginings. They are indeed in evident loss. Nevertheless, we beseech God, exalted be His glory, for the salvation of these people. What a pity that ears should be deprived of hearing.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! Thou hast spoken the truth. We have mentioned thee in another place with such praise as to cause bodies, let alone spirits, to soar. And this is yet another time. Give thanks unto God for this great bounty. We beseech Him to aid thee to manifest such steadfastness that neither the treasures of the world nor the ranks of nations shall deter thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. He hath come from the heaven of utterance with proof and clear evidence, yet the people have turned away from Him, following every ignorant doubter.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of the Wronged One and give thanks unto his Lord, the All-Bountiful. O Muhammad! Muhammad hath come, yet the people denied Him. And before Him came the Spirit (Christ), from Whom the people turned away, breaking God’s covenant and His testament - verily they are in manifest error. And before Him came Moses with clear signs, yet the people rose against Him and committed that which causeth every fair-minded person to lament. Behold what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “There came not unto them a Messenger but they did mock at him.” Blessed is he who hath cast away the people, clinging fast to His Name, the Self-Subsisting. He is indeed of them that occupy this exalted station.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Muhammad Ja’far! The Truth is manifest, and He hath commanded His servants to that which is the cause of the exaltation of being, glory and benefit. He hath repeatedly revealed in scriptures and tablets the path that leadeth unto Him, and hath counselled justice, fairness, trustworthiness and godliness. Blessed are they who have hearkened unto the voice of the Self-Sufficing and acted according to His bidding. After godliness, trustworthiness is mentioned as the first ornament and is inscribed as the primal word. Its light hath dominated and continueth to dominate all other lights even as the light of the sun. Blessed is the one who hath been illumined by its light and hath recognized its station. Be not grieved by the vicissitudes of time. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the tokens of the Most Exalted Pen. Preserve this station through His Name, the Truth, and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and Lord of all nations, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know.” That which hath befallen thee in the path of God - its recompense is preserved and treasured with the Trustworthy One, that is, with God, exalted be His glory. Rejoice and be of them that render thanks.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Muhammad before Mahdi and give him the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. His honor the Trustworthy One, upon him be My glory, made mention of you. Therefore have We brought forth from the treasured pearls of utterance that which lay hidden in the treasuries of the Most Exalted Pen, that thou mayest with the utmost assurance and certitude fix thy gaze upon the Most Sublime Horizon, detached and free from aught else. There is no harm in the loss of material possessions. However, should that which causeth the elevation of existence and is the source of human stations be lost, it would be a cause for a hundred thousand regrets. We beseech God to assist thee and ordain for thee that which conduceth to the good of this world and the next. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings to him. His letter was received some time ago and truly caused grief. God, exalted be His glory, hath ever counselled His servants to goodly deeds and to that which attracteth the people of the world. Without doubt trustworthiness, godliness, praiseworthy character and goodly deeds are the cause of attraction, while their opposites are the cause of aversion. This exalted word was previously uttered by the Lord of all being. Blessed and exalted be His word: “God, exalted be His glory, hath come for the manifestation of the gems of inner meanings from the mine of man.” Throughout nights and days there hath been sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness that which is the cause of the glory of existence. This evanescent servant beseecheth God to assist His servants and enable them to achieve that which is befitting. Verily He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. This much is submitted: nothing hath been or is hidden from God, exalted be His glory, and the recompense of every deed is clear and evident. Were it not for His mercy that hath preceded all, most of the people of the world would assuredly have been seized by the scourges of His wrath. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, by His ancient forgiveness, to enable His servants to be truthful, just and fair. He is the Powerful, and He is the Mighty.</p>
<p>That they have written that they gave four tumans to Jinab-i-Aqa Shaykh Hasan, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and likewise nineteen qirans to the emigrants of the land of Sad, upon them be Baha’u’llah’s glory, and similar instances - after being presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, He said: “Whatever is given to the friends of God is acceptable and approved. Permission has already been given to assist the companions to the extent possible. Would that nineteen tumans had been given instead of nineteen qirans.” Although that beloved of hearts is aware and informed of the details of that land, nevertheless the poor ones of those regions have ever been and continue to be in the sight of the True One, exalted be His glory. It is beloved that they show consideration to the extent of their ability. The command is in His hands and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>At this moment the Supreme Pen makes mention of the friends of Qamsar and Mazgan. His blessed and exalted Word: “O My loved ones! Hear the call of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. Praise be to God, ye are all mentioned in the presence and have attained a special bounty. We have, out of wisdom, concealed the names. God acts according to the requirements of His wisdom and has likewise commanded all to do the same. Praise be to God, in the Most Great Prison repeatedly have the glances of favor been directed to those regions and He has made mention and continues to make mention of His friends. Jinab-i-Amin, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, has mentioned you and has sought special favors from the Wronged One for all. We beseech God to aid you in that which He loves and is pleased with, to draw you nigh unto Him, and to ordain for you the reward of those who soared in the atmosphere of His love, hearkened unto His call, turned toward His horizon, stood before the door of His grandeur, and offered up their souls in His path. Rejoice, O My loved ones! Be glad, O My friends, in what hath flowed from My Pen concerning you in this station which hath been named the Most Great Prison through that which the hands of the heedless have wrought. The glory from Us be upon you and upon those who have cast behind their backs what the people possess, turning unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding the son of the Martyr, upon them both be Baha’u’llah’s glory, it was presented and was honored with acceptance in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and mention was made of each one from the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed are they who have been enabled to give and who spend to the extent of their ability in the path of God. Give to all the glad-tidings of this mighty blessing. This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist those who give in carrying out what they have undertaken. Verily He is the Helper, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>On this blessed night the Tongue of Grandeur utters these exalted words, His blessed and exalted Word: “O Amin! This time thou didst not make mention of Jinab-i-Navvab, upon him be My glory. In consideration of his demonstration of faithfulness, We make mention of him and We beseech God, exalted be His glory, on his behalf for that which shall make his reward everlasting and his mention eternal. O Navvab! The All-Giving says: The world is transient. At every moment its changes are manifest and its evanescence evident. Praise be to God that thou hast attained unto that which is mentioned in the Divine Kingdom. Preserve this most mighty, most exalted station and say:</p>
<p>“O my God, my Lord, O Gracious One, O Merciful One, O Self-Sufficient One! Thou hast shown favor, Thou hast bestowed grace. Thou hast drawn me from the left hand of idle fancies to the right hand of certitude, and from the crooked path of the people to Thy straight path and mighty announcement. No thanksgiving or praise can adequately meet Thy gifts or compare with them. I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the rain-showers of Thy Most Merciful grace and to preserve me through Thy mighty hand. Thou art the Hearer and Thou art the Powerful.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveys greetings to them and beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to inflame him with the heat generated by His love and to grant him eternal life from the Kawthar of utterance that flows from His Pen, that there may appear from him that which shall endure throughout the duration of His earthly and heavenly dominion.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention made of the spiritual friend, His honor Haji Siyyid Nasru’llah, upon him be the glory of God, and his father and his wife, the leaf who is the daughter of his paternal uncle, and the honored aunt, upon them be the glory of God - and likewise concerning the mention of their troubles and services and their acts of hospitality that were recorded - all were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and there was revealed specifically for each one that which this servant is unable and powerless to enumerate. The waves of the ocean of His bounty have not been and never shall be counted. Who is able to mention or enumerate that which hath appeared from a station that cannot be indicated by any indication, nor described by any description, nor mentioned by any mention? In truth, the souls mentioned have attained unto that of which the peoples of the world are deprived, save whom our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne hath willed.</p>
<p>To each one I convey greetings and salutations. The troubles of the spiritual friend, His honor Haji Siyyid Nasru’llah, upon him be the glory of God and His favors - which in truth are the cause of eternal rest and everlasting favor - are evident and manifest from the garden. Praise be to God that mention of them hath been and continueth to be made in the Most Holy Court. Blessed is he and happy is he.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention made of Hakim Reyhan and his son, and likewise their feast, after being submitted before the Throne of the Lord, these exalted words were revealed, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O Abu’l-Hasan! Make mention of each one on behalf of the Wronged One and say: The desire of this Wronged One is that the horizons be illumined with the light of unity, and that the rancor and hatred in the hearts of the various peoples be transformed into love and concord. We have mentioned that which conduceth to the refinement of souls, the betterment of the world, and the elevation and advancement of nations. We beseech God to aid all to act in accordance with that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen in the Tablets. Verily, He is the Helper, the All-Bountiful.” All the souls mentioned have been honored with divine remembrance and adorned with His favors. Which tongue can adequately render thanks, and which soul can befittingly hold fast unto what is meet? All are seen to be wanting and deficient, save those souls who are adorned with His remembrance, confirmed in His praise, and steadfast in service to His Cause. Blessed are they that act, and blessed are they that are firm.</p>
<p>As to what was written that “Today I am a guest at the home of Aqa Muhammad Husayn (Uncle Zaynal), upon him be the Glory of God,” and a request was made for mention of those gathered in that assembly - this was granted, and after being submitted, these verses dawned from the Dayspring of favors, blessed and exalted be His utterance: “O Mirza Hasan! Thy faithful mention hath caused Us to make mention of thee with that which shall never lose its fragrance throughout the duration of the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the worlds. Preserve this most exalted station through My Name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. O Ali (Aqa Hasan)! Ali came as the Creator; the Ali-worshippers cursed Him and finally martyred Him. We beseech God not to afflict the peoples of the world with the vain imaginings of the Shi’ih sect. He is verily the Powerful, the Almighty. O Mihraban! The Light is manifest, the Sun is shining, the Fire is speaking, the Manifestation is evident, yet the people remain heedless and veiled. Blessed is the soul that hath recognized the station of the Day of God and hath arisen as behooveth it. O Ali (Isma’il)! Ask the Shi’ihs: What was the fruit of your deeds on the Day of Reckoning and what became of them? They perpetrated that which no other sect in the world hath done. Woe unto them and unto those who led them astray.</p>
<p>O Jamshid! From the fire of divine love the light appeareth. This is the Day of attainment. The Mount hath attained unto its Interlocutor and the Tree unto its Fire. Blessed are they who have seen and recognized, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Husayn! Thy name was present at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, therefore have We turned unto thee and made mention of thee. Know thou the station of this mention and through the Name of God conceal it from the eyes of the heedless.</p>
<p>O Ali-Akbar! The Lord of Power hath made mention of thee from the Most Great Scene, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Praise be to God, thou wast present, thou didst attain, and thou didst drink from the cups of the world’s Sovereign. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bounteous, the Mighty, the Great.”</p>
<p>O Husayn (Uncle Zaynal) Amin, upon him be the Glory of God! Mention hath been made of thee and of thy household. Blessed is the house wherein My loved ones gather and from which My remembrance and praise are raised! We beseech God to protect thee, draw thee nigh unto Him, and ordain for thee the good of this world and of the world to come. We implore Him to make thee steadfast in His Cause, to enable thee to speak His praise, and to aid thee to serve His loved ones. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Answerer of prayers.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Each one hath been blessed with infinite bounties. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, hath encompassed the world. Today even the pebbles are engaged in remembrance and praise, yet souls remain deprived and forbidden. Glory be to our Lord! What a strange talisman - with eyes they see not, with ears they hear not. The Command is in God’s hands, the Possessor of Destiny.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Ghulam-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. The Supreme Pen hath repeatedly made mention of him. Specifically, one day at the farm, a Tablet was revealed in his name, wherein mention was also made of his son. I beseech God to deliver it and grant him attainment.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of Aqa Muhammad-Hashim and Aqa Muhammad, sons of Aqa Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented before Him, these verses were specifically revealed for them: “O My loved ones! The Wronged One remembereth you from the prison and giveth you glad tidings of God’s favor, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The gate of heaven hath been opened, and its Creator hath come with a clear command. He maketh mention of those who have turned unto Him, attained His presence, and quaffed the choice wine of recognition from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous. Take hold of that which hath been sent down unto you with power from God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Powerful. Glory be upon you both and upon those who have cast the idols behind them, hastening unto the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of Haji Nabil-i-Qa’ini, upon him be the Glory of God, favor hath been and continueth to be shown unto him. They said that from the earliest days he hath arisen to serve. God willing, until the end of his days he will remain focused on the Most Exalted Horizon, holding fast to the cord of grace and clinging to the hem of bounty. At the time of departure from the Land of Purpose, We specifically commanded his protection. Praise be to God, he attained unto the ocean of divine forgiveness. The glances of favor have been and are with him. We beseech God to assist him and ordain for him the good of this world and of the world to come.</p>
<p>As for the mention of the nephew of the one who turned away, after being presented before Him, these verses were revealed:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! In the letter of Amin, mention was made of thee; therefore, the glance of the Wronged One’s favor was directed towards thee. We beseech God to aid thee in such wise that the doubts and intimations of the people of the world may not hold thee back from thy goal. Throughout ages and centuries, the Shi’ihs sought after the Truth and searched for Him; yet when He appeared, they martyred Him. Give thanks unto the Desired One of the world, Who aided thee and guided thee to the straight path and the Great Announcement. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I have turned toward Thee, detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy verses and the heaven of Thy clear signs, and by the hearts which have soared unto Thee in their longing to attain Thy presence, to render me steadfast in Thy remembrance and successful in serving Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the world and the Sovereign of eternity, seated upon the Most Great Throne. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Ali! Blessed art thou and blessed is thy father who was named Hasan. We beseech God to grant from the chalice of steadfastness in such wise that the world shall be powerless to hinder. Take thou the Book of God with the hand of submission and resignation and preserve it through His might and power. Whosoever attaineth thereunto this day is mentioned as one of those who are nigh unto God. Verily He is the Protector of the sincere ones. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The second letter from that beloved one was dated the twenty-fifth of Dhi’l-Hajjih, number 3, and the last letter was dated the twenty-ninth of Dhi’l-Hajjih, number 4. It transformed the cottage into a palace and the eye into an ocean, and attained to hearing in the most exalted horizon. However, mention of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of bounty is beyond this evanescent one’s power to describe. That beloved of the heart hath himself witnessed and knoweth the waves of the ocean of bounty. A hundred thousand blessings be upon those souls who in this spiritual springtime have been blessed by the rain of the All-Merciful’s utterance.</p>
<p>Mention was made of arrival in the Land of Y and before that, proceeding to A and R. Likewise mention was made of Mirza R.F. and Mirza M.H., upon them be the Glory of God, and the friends of God in that land, upon them be the Glory of God. These matters were presented before His presence. This is what was revealed from the heaven of our Lord’s will, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He saith, exalted be His glory: “O Amin! Upon thee be My glory. Those related to the Most Great Victory, upon them be My glory and My bounty, and likewise the friends in that land have ever been and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court, especially Rafi’, upon him be My glory, and Muhammad, upon him be My bounty.” Two Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s mercy and were sent. God willing, they shall drink from the ocean of utterance and be illumined by the lights of the Sun of meanings.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, there hath been revealed for them that which would resurrect decayed bones and adorn the world of heedlessness with the ornament of awareness. Likewise there hath been revealed especially for the friends of that land, both men and women generally, that with which nothing in the world can compare. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant joy supreme to all.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the honored leaf, the mother of Mirza Hasan, upon her be the Glory of God. After being presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, this supreme word was revealed from the highest Kingdom. He saith, blessed and exalted be He: “O My handmaiden! Amin, upon him be My glory, hath mentioned thee, and likewise mentioned Muhammad-i-Qabli-Hasan, and hath beseeched bounty for you. Therefore the Sun of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the Supreme Pen’s heaven with His mention. Ye have been blessed with His mention. God willing, ye shall remain steadfast in His love. The doubts of the peoples have deprived the world from the Lord of eternity. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath turned and attained, and woe unto the heedless ones, both women and men. We counsel you to fear God and to that which leadeth to sanctity and detachment.”</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the wife of his honor the Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God - yes, as commanded, this servant forwarded one hundred and fifty, no more.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Tongue of Utterance in the Kingdom of Divine Knowledge, at this hour when two hours of night have passed, makes mention of thee and turns toward thee from the prison quarters. The treasures of the world and the wealth of nations cannot compare with this exalted Word which hath appeared from the Dayspring of the mouth of the Will of the Lord of all beings. The Command is in His hand and wealth is in the grasp of His power. Fleeting riches became the cause of everlasting mention. By the Sun of Truth! The profit is with thee and the loss with the taker. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. He changes the Command as He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Indeed, after hearing what befell them, boundless grief occurred, but after it was presented in His presence and verses were revealed, an ocean of joy appeared. All the world cannot compare with what hath been revealed. Every truthful and trustworthy one beareth witness to this. The Command is in the hand of God, our Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Amin! We have heard thy call and have repeatedly made mention of thee. The ocean of utterance is ever-surging and the cities of mention and praise are adorned through the will of the Lord of Names. Blessed is the one who possesseth hearing and attaineth unto listening, and likewise possesseth sight. Remind the friends in those regions of the mention, praise, bounty and favors of the Wronged One. Thou didst make mention of Ghulam, upon him be My glory. His name accordeth with his being. He hath attended and drunk the choice wine of utterance from the cup of his Lord’s bounty, the Mighty, the Bestower. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to aid him to attain such a station wherein the conditions of the world–its elevation and abasement, its ugliness and beauty–will not change him. May he remain seated upon the throne of tranquility and repose upon the couch of certitude. He hath attained unto the good from the presence of the Good One. The Lord of all mankind in His days beareth witness to this, and He sufficeth as a witness. We send Our greetings upon him, and peace be upon him from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of M.H. (formerly R.D.), upon him be the glory of God. He hath attained unto the Kawthar of divine mention. We mentioned him before and at this moment the Wronged One giveth him glad-tidings. We beseech God to strengthen him in that which will draw him near unto Him in all His worlds and to ordain for him, through His Most Exalted Pen, the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>O trustee! Each of the souls mentioned in the papers has attained to that which hath no peer or likeness. Give them the glad tidings of such grace and mercy as hath preceded existence itself, both seen and unseen. This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and glorification to the friends, especially to those gentlemen - upon them be the Most Glorious Glory of God - who were present at the aforementioned feast. Blessed are they, and joy be unto them! Praise be to our Lord and thanks be unto Him for having adorned them with His greatest ornament, which is the love of His Exalted Self, and for having aided them, caused them to recognize Him, and enabled them to hear in a Day wherein eyes were blind and ears were deaf. Thus did the grace of our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, encompass all.</p>
<p>I beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to aid each one to guide mankind. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth through His Word “Be” and it is. In this station, responses to the letters of that beloved one were mentioned one after another. The praise and thanksgiving that adorned and illumined the opening of these letters were each as volumes expressing divine bounty and manifesting the mercy of the All-Merciful. Praise be to God that that beloved one hath tasted the sweetness of recognition and acknowledgment, and hath mentioned, by the will of the True One, exalted be His glory, that which is befitting. The purpose is that your words and deeds have been accepted in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court.</p>
<p>We thank God, our Lord and the Lord of earth and heaven, Who created us, caused us to recognize Him, and aided us to mention and praise Him in His glorious and wondrous Day. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you who hearken unto your words in praise of God, our Lord and your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Lord of the Exalted Seat. And praise be to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>22 Rabi’u’l-Avval 1305</p>
<p>=== END BH00103 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00104 ===</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the All-Wise, the All-Eloquent! The world is observed to be in a state of upheaval and transformation. The singing of birds, compared to the Voice of the Speaker on Sinai and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing in the most exalted Paradise, holds no distinction in the eyes of men. The cooing of the doves of the sublime Paradise is, to most, indistinguishable from cawing and clamor. Yet soon shall sanctified eyes grow sharp and purified ears become attentive. We have previously uttered this most exalted Word: God, exalted be His glory, shall bestow the power of hearing, shall inspire understanding, shall grant the power of sight, and shall reveal the signs of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>These are the days of upheaval. Be not grieved by what they say and know. Thy letter was presented at the Most Holy Court and an answer was revealed. Concerning what thou didst mention about the misleading statements: By the life of God! He hath not perceived the fragrance of the divine utterance. How vast is the distance between earthworms and the luminous expanse of the most exalted Paradise! Great are the differences between the divine, luminous springtime and the dark autumn. During these days and nights, be occupied with protecting your own souls.</p>
<p>The source of vain imaginings hath not suffered a single blow in the path of God. He hath ever remained concealed behind veils. From his statements asking what hath become of the Word of the Primal Point and where it hath gone - though he himself wrote “Verily, I am He, the promised Qa’im Whose appearance ye have been promised” - if he believes in the hidden Qa’im, what then does he make of this verse and how does he interpret it? He is like those souls who arranged Jabulqa and established the holy precinct, and whose vain imaginings prevented multitudes from recognizing the truth.</p>
<p>Say: O misleader, fear God and speak with justice. Set aside […] and fix thy gaze upon reality. Today the Most Great Ocean is manifest with its waves, the Sun is shining with its effulgent rays, and the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing is visible with its countless fruits. What seekest thou from a name, and what desirest thou from a title? Were He to take a handful of dust and cause all names to be generated therefrom, verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Would that thou hadst asked him what was achieved and what became of the previous community during these twelve hundred years and more. Now fear God and cease occupying thyself with renewed delusions. Look to thyself, not to others. Listen with thine own ears, not the ears of others. The heaven of vain imaginings hath been rolled up by the hand of power, even as was rolled up the carpet of those who denied the Promised Day.</p>
<p>O Haydar ’Ali! Through the utterances of that ignorant one the world of the Bayan hath been darkened. The station of all things besides God is confirmed through His acceptance, exalted be His glory. The previous community did not inhale the fragrance of divine unity nor comprehend its meaning. Were permission to be granted, that which would cause the treasures of divine knowledge to appear would be revealed.</p>
<p>In the world, the previous community was seen to be divided, each faction cursing the other. They attributed all qualities to the letters of the Qur’an. If anyone were to assert a likeness, similitude, or peer for the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake, such a one would be deprived of true unity. Through His oneness, the sanctification of His Essence, and the exaltation of His Being was established the unity of His exalted Essence and the sanctification of His Self from any likeness or similitude. The Imams were created through His Word, and the foundation of faith depends upon accepting God, exalted be His glory. In all other stations there is proof, love, and friendship. Reflect upon this matter that thou mayest witness the Sun of Unity from the horizon of utterance. Faith is confined to His exalted Being. If a person be among the […]</p>
<p>Reflect upon this passage that thou mayest behold the Sun of Divine Unity from the horizon of utterance. Faith is exclusively in Him, the Most High. Should anyone become heedless of the divine chosen ones or the Letters, he shall be accounted among the transgressors in the sight of God. Know thou this and be of the thankful ones. Would that the heedless ignorant one who mentioned these particulars had said that these matters were specific to you. Even as the Point, out of fear of the turbaned ones, called Himself the Gate - to what depths He condescended out of kindness and due to the lack of understanding of Iran’s divines regarding this Revelation. He states: “He bestoweth Divine authority upon whomsoever He willeth and withholdeth it from whomsoever He desireth.” What have the spiritually immature ones of the world to do with such mentions and such words? This is the mystery of what the late Shaykh said when someone asked him about that word which the Qa’im would utter, which the three hundred and thirteen faithful ones of that day would not be able to bear, and about which the blessed Sadiq made mention of the letter “K” concerning them. After much warning that “thou canst not bear it,” he had said that if the Promised One should appear and say “Abandon belief in the birth of the Commander of the Faithful,” wouldst thou abandon it? Immediately he demurred and refused, saying “God forbid!” It is evident to the people of truth that he heard the word from His blessed tongue, and since he could not bear it, he became an unbeliever, though he perceived it not. This is because he looked not to the Source of the Cause. O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. One must look to the Source of the Cause. Similarly in the Bayan He states that the bodies of the Letters of the Living in this Revelation occupy the station of the spirits of the previous Letters. All are His servants and all act by His command. Such malevolent souls are the cause and source of volumes of vain imaginings, as they have written and continue to write. In one place He states that that Day is not a day for caution - at the mere hearing they must turn to Him. Now observe where He stands and where the understanding of those souls stands. One must lament. Beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, not to afflict later souls with previous vain imaginings. Say: O ignorant one! Thou who art at such stations, what fruit wouldst thou gain from the world’s prostration before thee? Turn unto God Who created thee and sustained thee. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Forgiver of sins for those who repent. And likewise He states that if anyone should speak a single verse, none should oppose him. Had this Revelation not been true, He would not have uttered such words. In any case, now they have turned away and denied myriad verses the like of which the world’s ears have never heard. O Haydar-’Ali! The Lord of Revelation was never and is not encompassed, rather He encompasses all. None save His own Self is fully aware of the manner of His Revelation. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Thou didst mention Haydar. A most mighty and holy Tablet, adorned with the seal, was sent. God willing, he will attain unto it. In truth he stands firm in service, and God, exalted be His glory, is aware. He sees him standing in His service and speaking His praise. We beseech God to aid him with the hosts of utterance, that he may conquer all who dwell in the realm of possibility through God’s compelling Word. We cried out today, turning toward the Bayan, and when […]</p>
<p>We beseech God to aid him with the hosts of utterance, that he may conquer all who dwell in the realm of contingent being through God’s sovereign Word. Today We turned toward utterance, and when We arrived and were established upon the throne of utterance, We revealed unto him who was named Most Noble. Every letter of his words testifieth to God’s loving-kindness and bounty. We made mention therein of how the Lord of all beings was opposed by vain imaginings which caused the people of the past to stumble when the Truth came with manifest sovereignty. By God’s life! They are the most lost of all factions, they who broke God’s covenant and His testament, who denied His proof and His evidence, and who spoke that which none before had spoken. As for what was mentioned concerning Haydar, We made mention of him from the direction of Our Most Great Scene that he might know and be among the thankful. We make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Qabli-Isma’il and give him glad tidings of God’s grace and mercy, that he may be steadfast in His Cause, firm in His love and unwavering in His service. Thy Lord speaketh the truth, but most people comprehend not.</p>
<p>Ask of God that He may guide souls aright. Meaningless names and tales cause people to waver. The chains of idle fancy have bound all save whom God willeth. However, God, exalted be His glory, hath servants who have transcended the names that exist among the people and have set their faces toward the highest horizon. No matter can prevent them, and they have passed like lightning beyond all save God, fixing their gaze upon the Horizon of Revelation, detached from all else but Him. Thy Lord, verily, aideth whom He willeth through His sovereignty, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Aqa Ghulam-’Ali, verily We have mentioned him before and will mention him again, and We mention him at this hour with a mention whereby the servants shall remember. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bestowing. Some time ago his letter written in the name of Allah-Mahdi reached the Most Holy Court. His words bore witness to his humility, submissiveness and devotion. The tongue giveth thanks to God and praiseth Him for having enabled him to make mention of Him and to arise to serve His conclusive and manifest Cause. Magnified be His face! By God’s life, My Most Exalted Pen loveth to make mention of His loved ones in the cities and lands, and to aid them to champion His Cause through wisdom and utterance. He is verily the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>We make mention of his son and those whose names were mentioned in his letter. By God’s life, each one of them hath attained unto the verses of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The gate of heaven hath been opened by Him Who is the Dawning-Place of gifts and favors, with a sovereignty that hath conquered all things and with a light that hath illumined all horizons. O youth! Rejoice thou in My mention of thee, then recall when thou wert in the presence of the Countenance and didst hear the voice of the Wronged One as He spoke before the faces of the servants. Forget not God’s favor unto thee when thou wert seated before His face, and He counseleth thee as God counseled His near servants who were not deterred by armies from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all beings. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy son and upon those who have taken the cup of steadfastness in the name of the Lord of creation and have drunk therefrom through the mention of God, the Revealer of verses. We make mention of him who was named Mahdi, who was mentioned in thy letter, that he may be assured that the reward of them that proclaim the Message shall not be lost. He hath been mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen with a mention that shall be preserved eternally in the protected treasury of God, the Lord of lords. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the traces of My Pen.</p>
<p>I testify that these souls have, from the dawn of days until now, been occupied with praise and remembrance and have been enabled to spend in His path, exalted be He. Today is the day of deeds, not words, and their deeds are a truthful witness and faithful testimony to their proof, detachment and service. They were created by God’s prevailing will and are related to Him. Happy are they and blessed are they. And regarding what you wrote about some of the friends, praise be to God that you are confirmed in what God has revealed in the Book. The reward of your deeds is with your Lord - God has made it a treasure for you with Him. Verily He is the Protector, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Especially for those related to His Holiness ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, including his son and wife and others, wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed and previously sent. Verily he has a station with your Lord - give him the glad tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which has preceded existence. And regarding what you wrote about permission for His Holiness ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God, after hearing this matter the luminary of permission shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of divine will. However this depends on wisdom - if wisdom requires it then movement is beloved, otherwise patience is necessary and the reward of attainment is specially reserved for him. Repeatedly from the heaven of the Supreme Being’s loving-kindness it was revealed that in this case their service in that place is a mighty matter and a great service. The Mother Book testifies to this in this station.</p>
<p>What you wrote about the unity and agreement of the friends - the least word that the Truth, exalted be His glory, has spoken regarding the order of the world was the word of unity and agreement. Ask of God that those few who have arisen to serve the divine Cause and have been honored with special distinction may unitedly and harmoniously engage in spreading and exalting the Word. By the life of God, great is the station of those who are humble before God! If assured, content and tranquil souls would show humility to one another […]</p>
<p>By My life! The station of those who show humility before God is great. If assured, contented and well-pleased souls were to vie with each other in humility and lowliness, this would be the cause of their exaltation, glory and loftiness of station before God. He verily commands His loved ones and the Hands of His Cause to do that which draws them nearer to Him and elevates their stations. He is, verily, powerful over all things.</p>
<p>At this moment the Supreme Pen desires to mention all those who were present at that gathering and to favor them with the outpourings of the Pen of Grace. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Asmi-Jamal! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness, My mercy and My grace. We beseech God to assist My loved ones to hearken unto thy words concerning this Most Great Announcement and the Straight Path of God.</p>
<p>O ’Ayn before Ta! Upon thee be the glory of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thou hast attained the presence and heard the Call and beheld the Horizon. Thy Lord verily aids His loved ones and He is the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Buzurg! Hear thou the Call again and again. Verily it hath been raised from the Fire kindled in the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Blessed is he who hath succeeded in hearing it and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of mankind!”</p>
<p>O Abdullah! The Sun hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison, saying: “Blessed art thou for having turned toward the Spot round which circle the Concourse on High and for having heard the Call of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Return.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>By My life, O Haydar-’Ali! The Wronged One, in an ocean of fire, makes mention of those who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of the Lord of creation. Were His loved ones to become aware of what has befallen Me at the hands of the oppressors among His creatures, they would weep both morn and eve. We have concealed most matters lest My loved ones in all lands be saddened thereby. We make mention of him who was named Yusif, who attained to that which most of mankind have failed to attain, and We have remembered him time and again. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We beseech God to aid him to do that which befitteth the people of Baha among His servants.</p>
<p>Say: O My loved ones! Take hold of that which We have commanded you. It will draw you nigh unto the most exalted station and will ordain for you, through His grace, that which will delight your eyes. Blessed is he whom the clamor of the ignorant hath not deterred, and steadfast is he whom the might of the powerful hath not made to falter.</p>
<p>O Ayyub! Upon thee be My glory. Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We have sent down upon thee from the heaven of bounty the rains of wisdom and utterance. Thy Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the One Who doeth as He pleaseth. Neither the happenings of the world nor the croaking of those who have denied the Beginning and the End can hinder Him. We beseech God to strengthen thee and sanctify thee through the Kawthar of utterance that thou mayest arise with all thy being to manifest the Cause among men.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy brother who attained Our presence in days when every doubting learned one was debarred therefrom. We also make mention of thy brother Akbar and give him the glad tidings of My mercy which hath encompassed all things. We beseech God to grant you success and ordain for you the best of this world and of the next. He, verily, is the Almighty, the One Who doeth what He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Karim! The All-Merciful maketh mention of thee from the prison quarter, that thou mayest be thankful and be of those who give thanks. We have mentioned thee before in such wise that the river of utterance hath flowed throughout all regions. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless. Thou hast attained unto My remembrance and the traces of My Pen. Thy Lord is, verily, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Verily he who stood before the Face was taken by the idolaters for themselves. We have revealed concerning them in My perspicuous Book that they are among the most lost. And among the people is he who hath said that he speaketh the verses of the Point. Say: Woe unto thee, O thou idolatrous disbeliever! Present thyself before the Face that thou mayest hear what no ear in the world hath heard and see what the eyes of the near ones have not beheld. Were the Primal Point alive, He would circle round Me and transcribe My verses which have been sent down from the heaven of the Will of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Fear God. Adorn your heads with the crown of detachment and your temples with the fear of God, the Mighty, the Praised. Consider the divines and jurisconsults of Persia and what they have committed on the Day of Reckoning. He verily aideth all to recognize this Most Great Announcement. They denied God’s proof and testimony and uttered that which caused the hearts of those near unto God to tremble.</p>
<p>We make mention of him whom We made a son to one who was martyred in My path and gave up his spirit in My love, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We have mentioned him before and counseled him with that which would exalt the station of man in the contingent world. We are, verily, the Counselor, the All-Knowing. We send greetings upon his face and enjoin upon him virtues from which the fragrances of God’s loving-kindness, the Goal of the mystics, may be diffused.</p>
<p>O My Pen! How is it that I see thee at all times in motion, speaking, remembering - at one time I see thee prostrate upon the dust, and at another time I see thee in manifest sorrow. How many nights in the early dawn hours have I heard thy sighs […]</p>
<p>Yet another has perceived manifest grief. How many nights have I heard your sighs, your cries and your lamentations in the early hours! Tell Me what has befallen thee, for verily I am the All-Powerful, the Almighty. He cried out saying: “O my Lord! With Thee is the knowledge of all things. Thou knowest and art aware, Thou hearest and seest, for Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. By Thy might and Thy majesty, I complain to Thee of those who have changed Thy blessing, denied Thy bounty, disbelieved in Thy signs, turned away from Thy face, and cast behind them that which Thou didst send down from the heaven of Thy utterance, attributing it to one who is powerless to open his mouth in the court of Thy glory. Alas! Alas! for this wrong that hath befallen me in Thy days. I beseech Thee by Thy Self and by the mysteries of Thy knowledge and power, O Lord of the worlds and Purpose of the nations, to place between me and Thy servants a barrier mightier than mountains, lest mine ears hear that which hath caused the hearts of Thy chosen ones in the Most Exalted Paradise and Thy honored servants to lament.”</p>
<p>Glory be to Thee, O my Purpose and my Beloved! Thy knowledge hath grieved me, and Thy patience and forbearance after Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Nasru’llah, who was mentioned in Thy Book, and We give him glad tidings of the signs of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. We beseech the Most High to make him steadfast in His Cause and firm in His love with such steadfastness as shall shake the foundations of the polytheists.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who was named ’Ali-Muhammad, that he may rejoice in My remembrance and be of the thankful ones. O ’Ali before Muhammad! One of My loved ones hath mentioned thee before, and We have sent down for thee a tablet that thine eyes may be consoled and thou mayest be of those who render thanks.</p>
<p>We make mention of My handmaiden and My leaf, My aunt. We have indeed mentioned her and given her the glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, His bounty, His generosity and His gifts. In truth, from the beginning until now she hath been occupied with remembrance, praise and service to the Cause.</p>
<p>We make mention of My handmaiden in Kaf who attained the presence at a time when the learned ones, the mystics, the wise ones, the men of letters and the ignorant ones were debarred therefrom. She hath attained unto that which the dwellers of Paradise have attained. Blessed is she and happy is she. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid her in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Strong, the Mighty.</p>
<p>We make mention of My leaf, My aunt’s daughter. We testify that she attained the presence before others attained it in the prison, and her deeds were accepted. From the beginning of the Cause until now they have been mentioned before the Wronged One and have rejoiced in His verses. The glance of favor hath been and is directed towards them. We beseech God to strengthen her and aid her in that which will draw her near in all conditions. Verily, He is the Protector of devoted men and women.</p>
<p>O Hoopoe! We have mentioned thee before and in this Clear Tablet. Thou art the one who attained the presence of My sister who was wronged in the land of Ta by reason of the fire of hatred which was kindled in the hearts of the oppressive men and women.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention the handmaiden of God, Fatimah, and her daughter. Praise be to God, they have been and are remembered by God. They have drunk from the cup of meeting and witnessed the waves of the ocean of divine utterance. They attained unto the blessed words “O My leaf” and “O My handmaiden.” We beseech God to strengthen them in steadfastness in His mighty Cause.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write regarding the chief, the purpose is that wisdom should be observed in dealing with persons of prominence in the government, for the people in authority must be protected from the envious […]</p>
<p>O My handmaiden! They have attained. We beseech God to assist them to remain steadfast in His Great Cause. Concerning what you wrote about the chief, the intention is that one should deal wisely with prominent government officials, for those in authority must be protected from the envious and the malicious. This is stated outwardly. Verily, He is the All-Knowing Protector. O Haydar-’Ali! The people of Iran have been and continue to be much attached to vain imaginings, such that even now some who claim knowledge have not freed themselves from such fancies and remain deprived of the light of the Sun of certitude. The Primal Point - may our souls be a sacrifice for His sake - with a hundred thousand verses trained the servants that perchance they would not remain deprived as before, and clearly forewarned of the wickedness of the people of the Bayan. His exalted Word states that if someone appears with but a single verse, reject him not, and so forth. Now they deny and reject millions upon millions of verses revealed without any veil or covering. A fancied name is mentioned while they remain veiled and deprived from their Creator, Protector and Sovereign. In truth, the existing ears and visible eyes were not and are not worthy of hearing and capable of seeing. Until now the deluded ones have not understood the cause of the former people’s veiling, and have not perceived the fragrance of the Day of God. We mention the names of those whom thou didst mention in thy letter. O Na’im! Upon thee be the Glory of God, His mercy, His grace and His bounty. He who loved Me and arose to serve Me hath mentioned thee. We have remembered thee in this Mighty Tablet. Give thanks unto thy Lord that He hath aided thee to turn towards Him when the pharaohs and tyrants of the earth turned away. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Let not the events of the world sadden thee, nor the affairs of those who denied the Day of Judgment prevent thee. Thou hast attained unto faith in days wherein the limbs of the polytheists trembled. We beseech God to aid thee and grant thee steadfastness in this Wise Remembrance. And We mention him who was named Mirza Abu’l-Qasim that the Remembrance may make him steadfast in this Great News. Steadfastness in this Cause is not achieved nor manifested except through detachment from the tales of old and what is with the people. This Book beareth witness to that in this exalted station. The true wings of the servants have been soiled with the clay of vain imaginings and are not capable of flight in the atmosphere of love for the Desired One of the worlds. The deniers of the Bayan, like unto the Shi’ih sect, wish to dispute and argue about vicegerency and leadership and shaykhi matters for a thousand years, and in the end their predicament shall be superior and better than the former people - they once again curse the Truth from the pulpits, even as that party is now engaged in this. O thou who hast turned towards God! Reflect on what We have revealed before and after, that thou mayest know the station of those who have denied God’s verses in this Mighty Revelation whereby the hearts of the polytheists have melted. We make mention of him who was named Fadlu’llah that he may find the fragrance of revelation and be among the firmly rooted ones. O Fadl! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness. By God’s life! The Wronged One hath come with that wherewith the Messengers of God, before and after, have come. But most of the people are among the deniers. Their vain imaginings have prevented them from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. They worship idols and perceive not […]</p>
<p>O people! How long will ye wander in the paths of ignorance and cleave to vain imaginings, devoid of understanding! Ye have rejected the Proof whereby ye claim to have believed in the Messengers of God, Lord of the Glorious Throne. Say: By God! The deeds of no one are accepted save through this manifest Cause, nor doth any supplication ascend to the heaven of acceptance - to this testifieth a hidden Tablet in His possession. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away what the people possess, hoping for that which is with God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Take hold of the Book with the power We have given thee, such that all the books of the world shall not prevent thee from this manifest Book. Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon - verily there is no God but Him, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Blessed is the servant who hath shown justice in this Most Great Cause, and woe unto the heedless ones.</p>
<p>Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, for having aided me to turn unto Thee and made me of those who are certain. I beseech Thee to assist me to be steadfast in this wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Horizon - verily there is no God but Him, the True One, Knower of the unseen. Thou hast been mentioned by him who appeared before Our presence and attained the honor of circumambulation during the Feast of Sacrifice, and who stood at the gate which was opened unto all who are in earth and heaven - he who was named Ali-before-Akbar at the scene of God, the Mighty, the Loving. We have mentioned thee before and at this time that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We beseech God to assist thee through His bounty and strengthen thee through His signs and draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>O Jew! Praise be to the Goal of the worlds Who hath aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Source of inspiration. Even as the pivot of the divines of Persia, namely Shaykh Muhammad Hasan, slipped from the path and returned to his former station. Glory be to God! Each day the blessed words “He maketh your highest to be lowest and your lowest to be highest” are evident and manifest. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to recognition and been adorned with the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Now what remaineth is the matter of steadfastness in the love of God. Many are the apostates, numberless the barking ones, the treacherous ones exist and the thieves are manifest. We beseech God to protect thee and His loved ones from the evil of these people. They have denied the signs of God, His sovereignty, His grandeur and His power, and are among the most lost in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Abdul-Husayn - upon him be the Glory of God. He hath attained to that which was denied to the parties except whom God, the Goal of the mystics, wished. We have sent down from the heaven of Our wisdom that whereby his mention shall endure through the endurance of the attributes of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Give him the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness and mercy. Then send unto him what hath been revealed in this mighty stronghold. He verily openeth before his face the gate of bestowal. He is, verily, powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned unto thee, heard thy call and thy rustling, and spoken of thy remembrance and praise among such servants as heard but recognized not their Lord, the All-Informed Speaker. He arose in the earliest days to serve the Cause and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken before the creation of the heavens and earths. We have mentioned him time and again and revealed for him that which hath diffused the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. His letter hath reached Us and We found from it the sweet savors of steadfastness and faithfulness in this manifest News. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those who have heard[…]</p>
<p>And upon those who heard and said “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that are near!”, O Haydar-’Ali, upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of this luminous Day. We have desired to make mention at the end of him who was named Lion in the Book of God, the Lord of all beings. We testify that he hastened and hearkened and attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. The verses so attracted him that he soared on wings of inner meanings unto God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, the All-Wise. Give him glad tidings of that which God hath sent down from this exalted station. Glory be from Us upon thee and upon him and upon those who have drunk the choice wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. O thou who drinkest the choice wine of My love! The matter of the Prison is momentous, and the correspondence abundant, and the petitions countless, and the names beyond reckoning. Night and day the Pen moveth and the Tongue speaketh. Ask thou of God that He may cause the immature ones of the world to attain true maturity, and bestow upon the ignorant among the peoples the knowledge of inner meaning. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but He, the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>
<p>=== END BH00104 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00106 ===</p>
<p>All praise, sanctified beyond the mention and recognition of the human world, befitteth and beseemeth the threshold of the sanctified nearness of the Lord of Oneness, Who hath caused the drop to surge as waves of an ocean and hath bestowed upon the atom the effulgences of a sun. His complete power hath subdued the world through one of His names, and His all-encompassing knowledge hath revealed countless books from a single point. The might of the world standeth confessed in powerlessness before His might, and the dominion of all who dwell in existence beareth witness to its weakness before the manifestations of His power. Exalted be His grandeur and glorified be His power! Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him! Through a single revelation of His Most Great Name He hath illumined the world, and through the blessed word “The Hidden Mystery hath appeared” hath He caused all things to speak. Through His hand of power the new heaven hath been raised up, and through His transcendent grace the gates of all good have been opened.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through the light of Whose countenance all created things have been illumined, and through the movement of the finger of Whose will all beings have been set in motion! That which lay hidden in the treasuries of Thy knowledge and stored in the repositories of Thy wisdom hath appeared and been made manifest. I beseech Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world and Lord of all nations, by the choice Wine whose seal was loosened by the finger of Thy might, and by the Kawthar which hath flowed forth by Thy command from the kingdom of Thine utterance, to assist Thy chosen ones to celebrate Thy praise and glory and to observe that which Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou art He to Whose power and might all things have testified. The machinations of Thy servants cannot frustrate Thee, nor can the opposition of them that dwell in Thy realm hinder Thee. Through Thy name the horizon of the heaven of recognition hath been made to shine, and through Thy will there have been sent down from Thy Most Exalted Pen the laws of all religions. O Lord! Aid Thy loved ones to recognize that which proceedeth from Thee, and teach them through Thy bounty from the sea of Thy knowledge that which will cause them to acknowledge Thy choosing and that Thou art the One Who hath power to do what He pleaseth and to ordain what He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Thereafter, this servant received thy letter which spoke in praise and glorification of God. When I read and understood it, I supplicated God - my Beloved and thy Beloved and the Beloved of all worlds - to assist thee in that which beseemeth His days and to make known unto thee that which had been concealed from most of the servants concerning the manifestations of the ocean of His power and His decree. After I had become acquainted with its contents, I repaired to the Most Great Scene until I attained the presence of the Lord of Destiny and presented that which was in thy letter. When thy words were honored to be heard by the Lord of Verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs, the Ancient Beauty turned to me and spoke, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious[…]</p>
<p>This is a mention from Our presence to those in the world, that it may draw them to the Most Great Name, which calleth aloud between earth and heaven and summoneth all who are in creation to the most exalted Horizon. Blessed is he who heareth and findeth the sweetness of the Most Great Sign, and blessed is he who seeth the dawning-places of the Lord of Names. Woe betide him who hath denied and disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. The atoms have testified to the Revealer of verses, yet most of the people remain heedless. They hear the call, yet deny it - verily they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord, the Mighty, the Generous. O Muhammad! The servant who was present hath come with thy letter and read it before the Wronged One in this mighty prison. When he gained the honor of hearing it, We answered thee with these verses that all the treasuries of the heavens and earth cannot equal. We make mention of thee and those who believed before. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Beware lest the affairs of creation hold thee back from the Truth. Leave them and what they possess and put thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We make mention of thee and those who have turned to the most exalted Horizon. To this testifieth the Kingdom of creation and he who hath with him a perspicuous Book. Say: O concourse of the earth! Rejoice in that the Most Great Joy hath appeared. Beware of following your divines who have turned away from God and pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as hath caused the Concourse on High to lament and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise to weep. To this testifieth every knowing, perceiving one. This is the Day that hath adorned the books of old with its mention and concerning which the Prophets and Messengers gave glad-tidings. Blessed is the strong one whom the veils of earth did not withhold nor whom the hosts of those who are heedless of this shining Horizon did frighten. Give thanks unto God for having remembered thee and revealed unto thee that which hath brought solace to the eyes of them who are nigh. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen once again addresses the friends in that land in Persian, that all may be illumined and gladdened by the effulgent rays of the Sun of Bounty. By the Sun of inner meaning, which hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of truth, this Wronged One hath in most times been occupied with the remembrance of the friends. From the Ancient Pen hath been sent down especially for each one that which is the cause and means of salvation in all divine worlds. Today is the day of mention and praise. All must hold fast unto wisdom and cleave unto it and fix their gaze upon it, for if anyone should exceed the bounds of wisdom in making mention, in speaking, or in teaching the Cause of the All-Merciful, his work shall not be accepted in the sight of the Truth. Strive ye to enable the dead to partake of the living waters through wisdom and utterance, that perchance the earth of true knowledge may be cleansed from unseemly fancies and imaginings and be illumined with the lights of the sun of certitude. Through God’s grace may ye succeed in preserving that which hath been bestowed upon you. The beginning of the Cause was the knowledge of God, and its end is steadfastness. How excellent is the state of him who hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness, in such wise that all else besides God is powerless to deter him. Most mighty is this Cause, and the manifestations of evil whispers lie in ambush. Beseech ye God to enable all to attain unto that which He loveth and pleaseth, and to deprive them not of the sweet-scented fragrances of His garment. He is your Beloved and your Goal, and hath been with you in all conditions. There is none other God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>From the utterances of Him from Whom verses are revealed - may the spirit of all who are in the kingdom of Command and Creation be a sacrifice unto Him - His marks of loving-kindness, affection and mercy toward the friends are evident and manifest. This servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He deprive not the peoples of the earth of the choice wine of His utterance, and that He cause the friends at all times to drink from the nine rivers, and enable them to mention Him, to praise Him and to serve His Cause. Were the souls in the world to become aware of the station and rank of this blessed Day, all would detach themselves from whatsoever is not of God and would hold fast unto the Most Strong Cord. But what profit is there when thick veils have prevented eyes from beholding the lights, and dark coverings have withheld hearts from the ornament of His love - save for those souls who have rent asunder veils and coverings through His Name, and whom the wine of the Salsabil of the All-Merciful’s utterance hath so affected that they have detached themselves from all else but God, and have turned with their entire being - soul, spirit, sight and heart - toward the Most Exalted Horizon. These veils and coverings that are mentioned refer to the allusions and doubts of the turban-wearing folk who are known among men as divines. They are the sources of idle fancies and the dawning-places of vain imaginings, and they are the idols of the people. Where is one possessed of power and might who could, through the strength of certitude, cast down these idols of fancy? The Cause is in His hands; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. The purpose of these words that have been submitted is not contention, dispute or corruption. What is meant by power, might and strength is steadfastness in the Cause of God; likewise, mention and utterance is a fire that consumeth the hearts of the idolaters and a light that illumineth the world of true knowledge. All the friends must at all times be mindful of wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom is a light that illuminates the world of knowledge. The friends must at all times observe wisdom and drink from its fountainhead. With utmost forbearance and through goodly utterances, they should lead people from the left hand of doubt to the right hand of certitude. Such counsels have repeatedly been heard from the Ancient Tongue. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto the heedless! Murder, plunder, treachery, persecution, corruption and conflict have been and will continue to be the way of the oppressors. God and His loved ones are sanctified, holy and pure from all such things.</p>
<p>In your letter there were complaints, but God is my witness that whenever letters from divine friends have arrived, this evanescent servant has, to the extent possible, not been remiss or negligent in replying. I do not recall receiving your letter except this once. And if at times a letter from one of the friends arrives and there is a delay in response, one should not be perturbed by such delay and should know with certainty that this delay was due to lack of time, not lack of love. This evanescent servant is occupied day and night in transcribing revealed verses before the face of the World’s Desired One, and this is a most mighty and momentous task. I beseech God - exalted be His glory, abundant His favors, and great His station - for support and confirmation to fulfill this duty. Nevertheless, whenever this evanescent one has found opportunity and time, he has not forgotten to mention the friends and has commemorated each one before the Throne. God is sufficient witness to this.</p>
<p>In this case, you should arise in thanksgiving and praise to the Beloved of the worlds and seek from God - exalted be His glory - confirmation for this servant. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Near, the Responding One, and He is the Hearing, the Witnessing, the Watchful One. The names of the friends mentioned in your letter were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. Wondrous and sublime verses were revealed from the heaven of grace specifically for each one. God willing, may all attain unto them and act according to what befits the Days of God.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad-Taqi, upon him be 96 [Baha]:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! He Who was hidden behind the veils of the Unseen and inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, maketh mention of thee. Give thanks unto God for this Most Great Remembrance. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We have mentioned thee before with a mention whose fragrance will never cease to persist throughout the eternity of My Best Names. To this testifieth every knowing one who is aware.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad-Rafi’, upon him be 96 [Baha]:</p>
<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the Kingdom</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Rafi’! My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee before, and at this moment also, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. That which was hidden from eternity hath appeared, and He hath revealed what He desired through His Name, the Powerful. Act thou according to what thou hast been commanded in the Book by the All-Knowing Commander. Beware lest the affairs of the world hold thee back from what the Lord of Names hath intended for thee. Leave the world and hold fast unto the Most Great Name, which speaketh among the nations: “There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Trustworthy.”</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Ba before Ba, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of eternity […]</p>
<p>O Ba before Ba! Hearken unto the call of the Lord of Names Who summoneth thee while sorrows encompass Him from all directions. Bear thou witness to that which God did testify before the creation of the heavens and earth - that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, and created thee and aided thee to recognize this Cause whereby the learned, the mystics and the princes have stumbled, save whom God, the Lord of all men, hath willed. God willing, thou shouldst arise to serve the Cause with the utmost joy and fragrance. Thy mention and name have flowed from the Supreme Pen, both before and after. Know thou the worth of this most great station and preserve it in the name of the Lord of existence. Ere long will the diverse conditions and colors of the world return to nothingness, while that which appeareth in the path of God hath been and shall ever be adorned with the ornament of immortality. Know thou the value of this most great station and this mighty rank. Beseech thou God, exalted be His glory, that He may aid thee in that which pleaseth Him, and that thou mayest not be deprived of that which would cause thee grief and regret. He is with thee under all conditions. Place thy trust in Him in all matters. He hath protected thee time and again and ordained for thee what He desired. He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Nasru’llah that he may rejoice in My remembrance and be of the thankful ones. O people of Baha! Hearken unto the call of Him Who created the heaven, which hath been raised in the luminous spot - the place which was recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Books of the Prophets and Messengers. We bid thee to act with righteousness and that whereby the station of man may be made manifest amongst the peoples of all religions. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The glory rest upon thee, upon thy father and upon those who have hearkened unto the counsel of God and followed that which they were bidden in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>That which was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the Rememberer and the Remembered One</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Thy mention hath been made in the presence of the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee this remembrance which cannot be equaled by all the treasures. We have turned from the direction of Our Most Great Prison toward those who have believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and We counsel them to perform pure deeds and to show forth the greatest steadfastness among the people. Verily thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His command “Be” and it is. Take thou the Book of God with a strength from Him, then read it at all times. By My life! Through it the fragrance of the garment hath been diffused and hearts have been attracted. O Muhammad! We love to see thee sanctified from all idle fancies. Thus doth thy Lord, the King of Kings, command thee.</p>
<p>That which was revealed for his honor Abu-Badi’ who was martyred in the path of God:</p>
<p>In My Name which is sanctified above all mention and names […]</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! We have desired to make mention of him who was martyred in My path, who expended all he possessed for love of My Beauty, and who detached himself from the world in his longing to attain My presence. He departed from his home, turning his face toward the splendors of My countenance, and traversed paths by land and sea until he reached the Most Great Scene - the Spot whereon the Lord of Destiny was established upon the Most Great Throne. When he presented himself at the gate, We caused him to hear Our most sweet call and showed him Our most glorious countenance. We bear witness that he attained the presence of his Lord, drank from the ocean of reunion, and was adorned with that which was recorded in the Books of God and celebrated in the Concourse on High. He is of them who rent asunder the veils and hastened unto the All-Glorious, the All-Bestowing. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all who are in earth and heaven, and the mercy of God and the mercy that hath preceded all who dwell in the kingdom of creation. We testify that he achieved the Most Great Steadfastness, whereby the backs of the discerning were broken among the peoples. Blessed art thou, O Majid, in that thou hast drunk the choice wine of My love, the Kawthar of My revelation, and the Salsabil of My grace. We bear witness that thou didst turn toward My horizon when My servants and My creatures turned away from Me, that thou didst hear My call and acknowledge that which My tongue hath acknowledged, and didst speak that which was sent down from the kingdom of Mine utterance, and wert steadfast in serving My Cause amidst My creation. Thou art he who heard the taunts of the enemies in My path, and now in this hour thou hearest thy praise and glorification from the tongue of My majesty and the kingdom of Mine utterance and the Pen of My Cause. Thou didst witness the wrath of the people in their hatred of Me; now in this hour We show thee the ocean of My mercy, the heaven of My bounty, and the sun of My loving-kindness. O Majid! Blessed art thou in that thou hast attained unto this remembrance through which the Daysprings of names and attributes, nay all atoms, make mention of thee. Blessed be thy tongue for having uttered My praise, thine eye for having beheld My proof, thine ear for having heard My verses, thy hand for having been raised to the heaven of My mercy and My grace, and thy foot for having stood firm in the service of My Cause. We make mention in this station of thy son, through whom the horizon of power was illumined and the might of God was made manifest among His servants. By My life! He was ablaze when he turned toward the place of sacrifice with a fire that enkindled the hearts and minds. He it is whom the Concourse on High welcomed in spirit, and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Kingdom of Names. We bear witness that he took the Sealed Wine from the hand of the Self-Subsisting and drank in His Name, through which the kingdom and the realm were attracted and the tongue spoke forth in the kingdom of utterance. Blessed be the All-Merciful Who sent forth this steadfast, firm, humble, submissive, mighty and wondrous servant. O Majid! Convey My greetings to the countenance of thy son and say: The glory shining forth from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, O thou through whom the limbs of them that turned away from God, the Creator of heaven, did quake, and the hearts of the mighty who cast the truth behind their backs in following vain imaginings were troubled. Blessed art thou, and he, and thy family who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. We counsel them with that which beseemeth them and with that which hath been sent down in the Book. The command is God’s, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bestowing. That which was revealed for His Eminence Mirza Kazim, upon him be the glory of God. He is the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Glorious.</p>
<p>O Kazim! The breezes of revelation have wafted, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful has been diffused, yet most people remain heedless. By the life of God! A single moment of these days cannot be compared with the years of the ancients. This is the Day of God which hath appeared with truth - the One promised in the books of the past. To this testifieth every fair-minded, truthful and discerning one. The world hath been illumined by the lights of His countenance, and the nightingale warbleth upon the branches. The Promise hath come to pass, and the Promised One proclaimeth: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Rejoice thou in My remembrance and say: “Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds!”</p>
<p>That which was revealed for Mirza Abu’l-Hassan, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Speaker, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hassan! The rain of thy Lord’s mercy hath poured down, and Kawthar and Salsabil have flowed, yet most people know it not. The ocean of utterance hath appeared in the contingent world, yet most people comprehend not. The atoms have testified to the Revealer of verses, and the Spirit proclaimeth: “The gate of heaven hath been opened, and the Desired One hath come with a sovereignty that encompasseth both the unseen and the visible.” Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto steadfastness in this Cause, whose greatness hath been attested by the Books of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Thus hath the tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in His hallowed and beloved kingdom.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The Day of God hath appeared, and the Point of the Bayan circleth round the Throne, and the Spirit giveth glad-tidings before His face, and the Sacred Valley proclaimeth: “Thine be the praise, O God of all worlds!” This is the Day whereon [mysteries] have been revealed, and traces made manifest, and the righteous have proclaimed: “The Promise hath come to pass!” And He Who was promised calleth aloud that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Draw nigh, O people, unto the Dayspring of your Lord’s Revelation, the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. Beware lest the hosts of princes prevent you from God, the Goal of them that know. O Muhammad, render thanks unto God for having attained unto this Most Great Remembrance in this Prison, round which circle the Concourse on High with hosts of favored angels.</p>
<p>That which was revealed to Aqa Siyyid Rida, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In the Name of the One God</p>
<p>O Rida! Strive thou that in these divine days thou mayest succeed in such deeds as shall be recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. All the peoples of the world were created for this blessed and wondrous Day. Blessed is the one who hath rent asunder the restraining veils and shattered the idle fancies, and hath turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon, which is the Dayspring of divine light and the Dawning-place of His Revelation. Beseech thou God that He may assist all to attain, and enable them to achieve His good-pleasure which is, in truth, the ultimate purpose of existence. The Herald of My Revelation hath said: “Strive ye that ye may attain unto the word of His good-pleasure.” This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him, yet the people have turned away. Strange that despite countless counsels, the people of the Bayan are seen to be deprived of the ocean of bounty and remote from the Source of nearness. Fie upon them and upon him who led them astray! By God’s life! They are among the most lost in His clear Book.</p>
<p>That which was revealed to Mulla ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>He is the One Manifest, the Speaker, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O ’Ali! We have heard thy mention, have pardoned thee and adorned thee with forgiveness, for We are the Most Generous. We have witnessed the turning of My loved ones and have turned toward them from the direction of the Prison, for We are the All-Kind, the Most Merciful. We have summoned the peoples from the Most Great Prison to this horizon whence have shone forth the suns of wisdom and utterance, for We are the Speaker, the All-Seeing. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord in this Day wherein all things have testified to God, Creator of earth and heaven and Lord of all names, and We are the Witness, the All-Knowing. Beware lest anything hold thee back from God. Say: O peoples of the earth! By God, the gate of grace hath been opened, the ocean of knowledge hath surged, and the fragrance of thy Lord’s bounty, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath been wafted. Beware lest the doubts of the divines or the intimations of those who have denied the Day of Judgment hold you back. O people! That which was recorded in God’s Books hath appeared. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. Reflect upon God’s Revelation and His proof, then judge with fairness and be not of the transgressors who cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed every ignorant remote one. Thus have We mentioned thee out of Our grace, and We counsel thee and those who believe to be steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped.</p>
<p>That which was revealed to Mashhadi Fat?-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God:</p>
<p>In the name of the All-Knowing Speaker […]</p>
<p>O Fath-’Ali! God willing, thou shalt be reckoned among the people of the divine Tabernacle. In the Books of old He maketh mention and giveth glad tidings unto all that dwell on earth of this Manifestation, that on that glorious and wondrous Day His Tabernacle shall be raised up in the most exalted place. Moreover, He giveth the glad tidings that this blessed, hallowed and mighty Tabernacle shall not be moved from place to place, its cords shall not be severed, and its stakes shall endure forever and ever. God willing, may all servants attain unto the recognition of this mighty Tabernacle, turn unto it, and be accounted as belonging to it in the Book of God. Blessed is the soul that hath hearkened unto the call of Truth and discovered its Purpose. Strive thou to attain unto the bounties of His days and to receive thy portion from His boundless ocean of mercy. Verily He is the Munificent, verily He is the Merciful.</p>
<p>Thus far, concerning the loved ones of the Beloved of the worlds whose names were mentioned in thy letter, exalted and glorious verses have been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the Lord of Oneness in that same order. This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, that He may aid them all in whatsoever beseemeth them and give them to drink from the Kawthar of His utterance, that they may be set ablaze with the fire of divine love in such wise that its effects may become manifest, evident and apparent in the hearts and souls of men. When this evanescent servant reached this point, he was summoned into the Most Holy Presence, and after attaining thereunto the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted Word - exalted be His glory: We desire to make mention of the other friends, both men and women, who were not mentioned in the letter, that all may attain unto the supreme honor, the supreme mercy, the most great bounty and the greatest favor. Verily their Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Munificent, the August, the Generous.</p>
<p>He is the One manifest from the horizon of light.</p>
<p>We make mention of the loved ones of the All-Merciful in that land, whom vain imaginings have not prevented from turning towards the countenance of God, the Lord of all worlds, that the attraction of the verses may seize them in such wise that neither the doubts of the people nor the gestures of the opposers may cause them grief. O My loved ones in that land! Rejoice in that the tongue of My loving-kindness hath made mention of you in My Most Great Prison. Give thanks unto God for having aided you to recognize the Dawning-Place of Revelation, through which every wise command hath been made manifest. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My days, soared in My atmosphere, submitted to My sovereignty, and acted in accordance with what is in My perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>This Wronged One conveyeth His greetings to all the friends, both men and women. The names of all are mentioned before His countenance and recorded in the Book by the Most Exalted Pen. Strive ye, that this precious pearl may be preserved from thieves and traitors in the name of the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The cawing of the crows hath become manifest. God willing, may ye drink at all times from the spring of steadfastness through His grace. Today steadfastness is among the greatest of all deeds in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. God willing, may ye be adorned with its ornament and be enabled to speak and act as befitteth. In all conditions be mindful of wisdom, lest anything arise that would cause upheaval and commotion. He, verily, commandeth you to observe what is right, as a token of His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>We, from this spot, send Our greetings upon your faces and upon the faces of My handmaidens who have turned towards Me, hearkened, and believed in the One, the All-Informed. Praise be to God, the King, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to the friends and loved ones, and beseecheth God to keep them all steadfast upon His path, that the lights of the sun of steadfastness may shine forth from the countenance of each one. This is the most great station. To the Seal of the Prophets–may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake–He saith: “Be thou steadfast as thou hast been commanded.” Now ponder upon the greatness of this matter. His Holiness, despite His grandeur of station, majesty of rank, and might and power–nay, all these attributes having appeared through His will–was nevertheless addressed with the blessed words “Be thou steadfast.” In its primary reality, the souls who have turned to God were and are the intended meaning of this verse, for His Holiness standeth in a station wherein all these conditions are but shadows beneath it. In any case, we beseech God–glorified be His majesty–to enable this evanescent one and all others to attain unto this most great adorning and mighty station. Verily our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O friends! Strive ye that ye may receive your portion and share from this blessed Day. Today is the day of service. All must arise to serve the Cause of the Lord of all beings with perfect love and unity, and act in accordance with what the Beloved hath revealed in the Book.</p>
<p>And as to what you wrote concerning your brother who ascended unto God, all are beheld in the Most Holy Court in one spot, in one station, and all the friends are adorned with the ornament of life. Many are they who have apparently ascended, yet most holy and transcendent Tablets were specifically revealed for them from the heaven of the Divine Will. After his ascension, for several years glorious and sublime Tablets were revealed specifically for Rida’u’r-Ru?, upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God, and were sent to that land. In brief, the true and sincere friends are living and alive before God, while others are among the dead even though they walk and eat and speak, as attested in the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Those souls are alive with their Lord while others are dead in the graves of their bodies. Thus has it been in all ages. Blessed are they who possess insight.</p>
<p>One of the apostles was in the presence of the Spirit of God, Jesus Son of Mary - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - when news arrived that his father had died. He said “O Spirit of God, grant me leave to go and bury my father.” He replied: “Let the dead bury their dead.” Implore God that He may quicken all through the Water of Life and deliver them from the abasement of death. Verily He is the Generous Giver.</p>
<p>This matter was also presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. These are the words uttered by the Tongue of the Most Merciful - may the spirit of all possibilities be a sacrifice for His utterance. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O Muhammad! We bid thee once again at this time to convey greetings to thy brother who hath ascended unto Us, from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>The Glory be upon you and upon those who have turned to the Supreme Horizon, and upon the handmaidens of God, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>24 Dhi’l-Hajjih 1298</p>
<p>A further submission: After completing the letter, the Servant sought the Ultimate Goal and Supreme Summit. After arising in the Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered these blessed and decisive words - His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O Present Servant! Write to Muhammad: We counsel thee regarding My loved ones, then We counsel thee regarding My loved ones who have arisen to serve My Cause and have spoken My beautiful praise.”</p>
<p>=== END BH00106 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00107 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be unto Him Who is the Ultimate Goal, for in establishing His Cause He hath sought no other proof besides Himself, and no mention of aught else hath found or findeth access unto Him, inasmuch as He is sanctified above all that is in the world. Great indeed is this Day wherein the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - in the Most Exalted Paradise and the Most Glorious Horizon proclaimeth “Verily, I am the first of them that worship.” We beseech the Most High to preserve His servants from vain imaginings and idle fancies, for the abominable Shi’ih sect hath been and continueth to be deprived of the recognition of the Hidden and Treasured Name through their vain imaginings and idle fancies. They considered themselves the most exalted of creation and the most profitable among the inhabitants of all lands, whereas in the sight of God they are reckoned among the basest of creation and the most lost of servants. For twelve hundred years they cried out “O Vicegerent!” yet on the Day of Reckoning they slew the Creator of a hundred thousand vicegerents. Now again some of the opposers are preventing people from the Lord of all beings through these same means. Time and again this exalted word was heard from the Sovereign of the Kingdom of Names - blessed and exalted be His utterance: “Until they pass beyond the river of names, they shall not attain unto the ocean of inner meanings.” In any case, this servant and that honored one and all others must beseech God to preserve the people of God from these names and former matters and the vain imaginings of that rejected sect. Glory be to God! In the beginning of the Cause the divines of the Shi’ih sect prevented the helpless people from approaching the shore of the sea of oneness, and how many servants did they sentence and execute merely out of selfish desire. To this day they curse the Truth from their pulpits. Indeed, they have committed that which neither Jews nor Christians, nay even the idolaters have committed. In all circumstances we seek preservation and assistance from God, glorified be His majesty, that perchance the servants of God may not hereafter be afflicted with the vain imaginings of that heedless sect. The Command is in God’s hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of my heart, in a previous letter it was promised that the remainder of the answer to your elevated letter would be sent later. Now is the time to fulfill that promise.</p>
<p>In the Name of our All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord!</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Haji Fadlu’llah and his honor Kaka Khan, upon them be the glory of God. The answer to the first name was previously mentioned, and in this station the second one is addressed through these sublime utterances which flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur - blessed and exalted be His word:</p>
<p>He is the One Who hath dominion over what was and what shall be!</p>
<p>O Fadlu’llah! Praise be to God, the grace of God - glorified be His majesty - encompassed thee and circumstances, by the command of the Lord of the Day of Return, assisted thee, and thou didst attain unto that which was revealed in the divine Books of the past and present. Today the blessed word “The Truth hath come” can be heard from the waves of the seas, the leaves of the trees, the rushing of the winds, and the flowing of the rivers. When thou hearest the call from the Most Exalted Horizon, say: […]</p>
<p>All praise be to Thee, O Lord of all being and Master of the Throne on high and of earth below, for having given me to drink from the Kawthar of immortality by Thy bounteous hand, and made known to me Thy Cause, and illumined for me Thy path, and revealed to me Thy proof. I testify before the faces of all mankind that Thy proof hath encompassed the nations and Thy evidence hath appeared by Thy command and shone forth by Thy will. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the seen and unseen worlds, by the station which Thou hast honored with the establishment of Thy throne thereon, and by the city which Thou hast made the footstool of Thy feet, and by the House wherein Thy call was raised, and by the lands which have been blessed by Thy favoring glance, to make me one who speaketh Thy praise and glorification, and who holdeth fast to the cord of Thy grace in such wise that neither the power of men nor the veils of glory shall hold me back. I shall arise in Thy Name to serve Thy Cause and summon the servants through wisdom and utterance to the court of Thy glory. O my Lord! Let me taste a drop from the ocean of Thy knowledge and illumine my heart and my whole being with the dawning lights of the Sun of Thy wisdom. Thou seest me, O my God, turning to Thee and detached from all else but Thee, beseeching from the heaven of Thy bounty the wonders of Thy grace. Would the All-Possessing turn away the poor from His door? Would the All-Knowing cast out the ignorant from His presence? Nay, by Thy glory! I am certain of Thy grace and bounty, Thy power and strength, Thy riches and wealth. I beseech Thee, O my God, to assist me in that which shall waft the fragrances of Thy acceptance and good-pleasure. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Munificent, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Kaka Khan, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the ocean of utterance hath surged!</p>
<p>O Kaka Khan! Upon thee be the Glory of the All-Merciful! This Wronged One mentioneth to everyone that which is easy to understand. Were all the peoples of the world to recognize this single word which now floweth from the Most Exalted Pen, all would exclaim “We believe in Thee, O God of the worlds!” For twelve hundred years and more, among the established and certain beliefs of the Shi’ih sect was the life of the Qa’im and His existence in well-known cities, and whosoever claimed His birth was put to death. Then it became clear and evident to men of insight that this sect had been in error, and throughout these twelve hundred years not one among their divines or others gained any knowledge of the birth of the Manifestation and the manner thereof, wandering instead in the valleys of fancy and imagination. In such circumstance, how can any fair-minded and knowledgeable person confirm other matters that have proceeded from that sect? In brief, the purpose is that one must purify the hearing of heart and conscience from all that hath been heard from this sect, that one may become enabled to hearken unto that which hath been revealed and made manifest from the Most Exalted Pen. Until now God hath concealed, for the world is seen to be deprived of hearing ears. When thou art blessed with My mention, say: “All praise be to Thee, O Lord of the kings of the world, and all glory be to Thee, O Desire of the nations, for having revealed unto me in Thy Most Great Prison that which shall endure as long as Thy names and attributes endure. Verily Thou art the Almighty, doing as Thou pleasest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant is engaged in praise and glorification with both outer and inner tongue, for at all times the waves of His ocean of bounty have encompassed and continue to encompass His loved ones. For every name there hath been revealed that which is a proof for all and an evidence for all, that all may know what hath appeared in the days of God, our Lord and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>In the Name of Him Who speaks before all faces!</p>
<p>Today the Dayspring of divine verses and the Orient of heavenly revelation, the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery, calls out before the faces of princes and divines, giving unto all the glad tidings of that which hath been ordained in the Book of God especially for His chosen ones. O Abu’l-Fadl! The veils of self and passion, and the shrouds of the people of tyranny and transgression, have prevented the Sun of Justice from shining forth and have deprived the servants of this most great bounty. For ages they yearned and longed for the presence of the Lord of Names, yet when the breezes of God wafted in this spiritual morn and luminous dawn, and the Speaker of Sinai was established upon the throne of manifestation, all turned away and assailed the Lord of Names with arrows of hatred and spears of enmity. They wrought that which causeth the Tablet to cry “O the grief!” and the Pen to lament “O the regret!” Rivers of blood flow from the hearts of them that are near and sincere unto this day. The divines of the Shi’ih sect are aflame with the fire of hatred and strive to shed the blood of the chosen ones and pure ones. God is Most Great! Night and day they occupy themselves with building imaginary cities and towns, deprived of the lights of the Sun of certitude. To this day none hath reflected, nor doth reflect, on what were the words of that people and what shall be their recompense on the Day of Retribution. We beseech God to acquaint thee with that which was concealed from eyes and to aid thee in mentioning that which was barred from sight. The waves of the ocean of utterance are manifest at the heart of contingent being, and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth shine forth from the horizon of the prison, yet the heedless servants circle round a shallow pool and worship the idols of vain imaginings. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink of the Kawthar of Thy utterance and guided me to Thy path and shown me the traces of Thy Pen and caused me to hear Thy call. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to aid me in Thy remembrance and to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for his honor Mirza Muhammad Khan, upon him be the glory of God:</p>
<p>In the name of Him Who is supreme over all who are in earth and heaven!</p>
<p>A remembrance from the Wronged One to him who hath believed in God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting, that the fragrances of remembrance and utterance may attract him to the horizon of the manifestation of his Lord, the All-Merciful - the station wherein the atoms proclaim: The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Thy name was mentioned before the Prisoner in His Most Great Prison. We have remembered thee with that which the remembrances of all peoples cannot equal. Verily thy Lord is powerful to do as He pleaseth through His word “Be” and it is. We have made manifest the path and have sent down from the heaven of grace that whereby hearts are illumined and eyes are solaced. Blessed is he who hath drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of the bounty of his Lord and hath attained unto such steadfastness as the hosts of them that have disbelieved in God, the Almighty, the Most Loving, could not prevent. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of utterance from My garment, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me from Thy prison, and for having sent down unto me that from which Thy near ones perceive the fragrance of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy grace and what lieth concealed therein of the pearls of Thy knowledge and wisdom, that Thou mayest ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall be a healing for all ailments and an antidote for the weakness of bodies. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and confessing Thy unity and Thy singleness. I beseech Thee to make me a servant of Thy remembrance amongst Thy servants and a standard of Thy Name in Thy lands. Verily Thou art He to Whose strength and power all created things have testified, and to Whose grandeur and sovereignty all things possible have borne witness. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Today the letters of the Book are each chanting a melody in the Divine gathering, but these chants need pure ears. The Tree of Hope is, praise be to God, present and visible. At one time this exalted word was heard from the Supreme Kingdom - His exalted Word: “O servant in attendance, be not grieved. The True One, glorified be His majesty, bestoweth the ear and causeth to hear.” This is a word from which the sea of glad-tidings hath surged amongst creation. Blessed are they that drink therefrom.</p>
<p>Mention was made of his honor Malik-Husayn-i-Khabbaz, upon him be the Glory of God. After it was presented before the Most Holy Court, the divine ocean of utterance surged and this Tablet shone forth from the Dayspring of grace. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hear the call of the Wronged One. Strive that perchance the servants may not, like the previous party, become ensnared by idle fancies and vain imaginings. For twelve hundred years they were occupied with the mention of the Successor while deprived of the Truth, and when the Sun of Manifestation dawned forth they attacked like the beasts of the earth and visited upon the Lord of existence that which no true seer or spiritual hearer can bear to witness or hear. Now the deniers of the Bayan are again occupied with the same vain imaginings. They have clung to one who was engaged in service beneath the pavilions of grandeur, and yet they remain debarred from the Truth. Although no one was with Us or informed of matters, nevertheless they have resorted to calumnies the like of which have never been heard. Say:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Adorn Thy servants with the ornament of justice and fairness, and enable them to behold Thy signs with Thine eyes and to hear Thy call with Thine ears. Thou seest what hath befallen Thy loved ones and hearest the clamor of the idolaters among Thine enemies. I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Manifest, the Hidden, which calleth out before all faces, to aid them to draw nigh unto Thee and to turn toward the lights of Thy countenance. O Lord! Withhold them not from the revelations of the Sun of Thy knowledge in Thy days. Verily Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word “Be” and it is.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of his honor Rida Khan and his honor Muhammad-’Ali Khan, upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented before the special presence, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace for each one, that they might draw nigh unto God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for his honor Rida Khan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>The Wronged One makes mention of thee for the sake of God and reminds thee of His verses which hold sway over all who are in the heavens and on earth. The light hath dawned from the horizon of the heaven of utterance, whereby the earth hath been illumined, yet the people remain behind an obvious veil. This is a Day wherein atoms proclaim with loudest voice, while most among mankind remain heedless. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One: Raise thy hand and rend asunder therewith the veil of idle fancy, in the name of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting, that thou mayest behold what was hidden from eyes and concealed in the knowledge of God, Lord of all worlds. When thou art attracted by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and art seized by the choice wine of My Most Glorious Name, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me, and glory be to Thee for having honored me, and thanksgiving be to Thee for having strengthened me on a Day wherein the people of Thy realm have turned away from Thee. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, by Thy Most Great Name, to number me among them who have turned towards Thee and hastened until they took the Kawthar of eternity from the hand of Thy bounty and drank in Thy name amongst Thy servants. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to the horizon of Thy Manifestation, the Dayspring of Thy verses, and the Source of Thy commandments and ordinances. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me that which Thou hast ordained for such of Thy servants as are detached. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is no God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And this was revealed for His Honor Muhammad-’Ali Khan, the Minister’s Overseer. Exalted be His utterance and glorious His proof:</p>
<p>In My Name, through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted throughout all contingent being!</p>
<p>This is a Day wherein the Caller hath called out before the faces of all people: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds! The Most Great Ocean hath appeared, and We have brought forth the pearls of wisdom and utterance which lay hidden and treasured within its shells, by the command of God, the Mighty, the Wise. The Promise hath come, and the Promised One hath appeared before the faces of princes and divines. He hath spoken that which We commanded Him from God, the Powerful, the Almighty, such that neither the power of the world could weaken Him, nor could the might of kings and sovereigns prevent Him. We have sent down the verses and manifested the evidences for the guidance of all people, whereunto testifieth His clear Book. We were walking in the prison and swimming in the ocean of utterance. We have turned toward thee and made mention of thee with that which shall never perish, so long as the kingdom of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous, endureth. When thou attainest unto My Tablet and findest the fragrance of thy Lord’s verses, say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! My outward and inward tongue, my limbs and members, my veins and the very hairs of my body bear witness to Thy unity and oneness, and that Thou art the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the breaths of Thy revelation to ordain for me that which will cause me to turn to the light of Thy countenance, to speak in praise of Thy Self, to hearken unto the verses of Thy Most Exalted Pen and Thy sweetest call, and to arise to serve Thy Cause, O Lord of all being! O Lord! Thou seest the weak one clinging to the cord of Thy strength, and the poor one seeking the door of Thy riches. I beseech Thee not to disappoint him in that which he seeketh from the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>How sweet is the fragrance of divine utterance and the diffusion of the musk of the Merciful’s knowledge! We must, in the nights and days, beseech the True One - exalted be His dominion and mighty His proof - to make the people of earth receptive, that they may not be deprived of the special effusions of His days, that they may detach themselves from what they possess and turn to that which is with God. Glory be to God! The various parties of the world each cling to certain proofs and evidences. For example, the followers of the Gospel hold fast to a few pages, and by these limited pages consider themselves superior to and better than all other peoples. And before that, the Torah, which was specific to Moses, consisted of a few books. They have gathered various sayings of the Prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, Solomon, David, Jeremiah, Zechariah and others into one volume, though most parts of it are historical accounts written after Moses. Then came the decree of the Furqan (Qur’an), which in truth distinguishes between right and wrong. Those were the days of the Seal of the Prophets, His was the epoch and His the time. Besides what has been mentioned, none possessed anything else. And now, many equivalents to all these have been revealed and are available and evident. Yet the heedless, ignorant servants remain deprived and forbidden. The servant testifies that this is the recompense of their deeds in turning away from the Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Speaker of Sinai.</p>
<p>In service to the opposers, this servant offers two words: Let some be appointed as representatives by others and come to this land, but on condition that they possess their own eyes and ears, as they are commanded in this Revelation, and witness that which equals all previous books and accept it. And if they desire, another equivalent can be newly revealed, provided all acknowledge that these verses did not exist before and have descended from the heaven of divine nature. Even then, I do not impose the obligation of belief. Let it suffice that they cause no harm nor bring about that which would cause the atoms of creation to lament and wail. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of proof that we are unable to enumerate all that hath been revealed until now, and until now it has not been compiled. O brothers! The Tongue of Grandeur hath repeatedly said and continues to say: O people! The ocean of inner meanings surges before your faces at its utmost height, and its waves are visible to every possessor of sight, and the sun of grace shines resplendent above the heads of all. O servants! Behold and judge with fairness, yet until now ye remain heedless.</p>
<p>Give justice and be fair! Nevertheless, until now they remain heedless, clinging to former traditions - most of which are fabrications of the Shi’ih sect - and have perpetrated against the Truth Itself that which no oppressor has ever perpetrated. O my God, my God! Aid Thy servants to justice and fairness, and enable them to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears. Thou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the friends of God - his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad T. R., his honor Aqa Mirza Ahmad, his honor Aqa ’Ali-Muhammad, his honor Aqa Muhammad ’Allaf, his honor Aqa ’Ali, and their honored mother, upon them be the glory of God. Mention of each was made in the most exalted heights before the face of the Lord of Names, and unto each were specifically revealed wondrous and exalted verses from the heaven of grace. Thus speaks He, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>He is the Answerer from His most glorious horizon.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We sent forth Muhammad with signs that drew unto Him the hearts of those near unto God, and with clear proofs that illumined the horizons of the hearts of the sincere. We commanded him to cast upon mankind the Word of Unity, as a grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Yet the people denied Him, turned away from Him, opposed Him, and committed that which caused every fair-minded and discerning one to cry out. We beseech God to aid thee to rend asunder the veils before the faces of the various peoples, and to strengthen thee in that which befitteth this glorious and radiant Day. Say: O people! The Day of God is come. Hearken unto that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: to lead the people out of darkness into light and to remind them of the Days of God. Thus was it sent down aforetime from the presence of One knowing, wise. Give thanks unto God for that the Wronged One hath remembered thee while confined in a far-off place. In exile, He calleth all to the most exalted homeland; in abasement, He ordaineth for His loved ones supreme glory; in prison, He speaketh in every condition that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Ahmad! By the life of God, the musk of divine knowledge hath perfumed all creation, and the All-Merciful hath come with the kingdom of clear proof, yet most of the people have turned away. The Book speaketh the truth, but they hear not. The heaven proclaimeth, the Sun declareth, yet most of mankind know not. Their desires have held them back from their Lord - nay, they comprehend not. The ornaments of the world with their various hues have occupied them, as witness noble servants. We beseech God the Exalted to strengthen thee to hold fast to His cord and to cling to His robe, such that neither cannons nor armies shall keep thee back from the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal.</p>
<p>O son of Sha’ban! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. It hath been raised from this exalted place, and He hath revealed for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Kind. Thy name was presented before the Wronged One, Who hath remembered thee with verses that all the treasuries of kings cannot equal. When thou hearest the call from the direction of ’Akka, say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy light that is never extinguished, by the fire of Thy love that is never veiled, and by Thy carpet that is never rolled up, to make me steadfast in Thy love, firm in Thy Cause, and upright in acting according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou art verily the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Loving. O Lord! Thou seest me turning unto Thee, with my house serving as an abode and shelter for Thy loved ones. I beseech Thee to adorn it at all times with Thy remembrance and praise, that there may ascend from it, through the tongues of Thy loved ones, mention of that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou art verily the Strong, the Powerful. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Reflect upon the tribulations that have befallen the Wronged One. From the earliest days until now He hath summoned all to the truth, while at all times He hath been afflicted by the tyranny of enemies. At times the abode of the Wronged One was the prison of Ta, at times the prison of Mim, at times the Land of Mystery, and now the Most Great Prison. Nevertheless, in all conditions and circumstances, without any veil or concealment, He gave the peoples of the world glad tidings of the favors of the Lord of Eternity, and there was sent down from the heaven of His Will that which is sanctified above likeness and similitude. Every possessor of justice hath testified to His greatness, and every fair-minded one hath witnessed His power and is well aware. Beseech God that He deprive not His servants, that perchance they may be illumined by the lights of certitude and attain unto the hearing of His call. The days are His days, and the reins of grace and bounty are in the grasp of His power. He is the Omnipotent One Whom the hosts of the world could not hinder from making mention. He stood before all faces and proclaimed: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful!”</p>
<p>O Ali, O son of Ibrahim, upon thee and upon him be My glory! This Wronged One hath turned toward thee in this night and maketh mention of thee, that thou mayest hear and be of them that are thankful. Idle fancies and vain imaginings have debarred the people from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. The proof is evident, the testimony manifest, the path clear, yet the tyranny and rebellion of most have prevented them from turning to the Purpose of the worlds. Today the Tree speaketh for itself, its fruits are manifest in utmost delicacy, the carpet of utterance is spread forth, and the people of Baha are engaged in praise and glorification with the utmost joy, gladness, glory and delight. Blessed is the one whom the calumnies of the Shi’ih party have not prevented from the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness. Say: O friends, take ye the cup of immortality from the hand of bounty! Take it in His Name and drink it in His remembrance. Well is it with you and pleasant it is to you! The glory from Us be upon thy father who hath ascended to the Most Sublime Companion, and upon thee, and upon thy mother, and upon those who have attained unto My mention, My loving providence and My beauteous praise.</p>
<p>And likewise in another letter mention was made of His Holiness Haji Mulla Ali, upon him be Baha’u’llah. His mention was made in the Most Holy Court and a Most Glorious Tablet was sent down from the heaven of grace in answer to his petition. God willing, may he receive his full portion from the bounties of these days. This servant beseecheth God to grant him success, for it would be regrettable if one such as he should remain deprived of the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord in this day. Verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful, and He is the Compassionate, the Generous. Concerning what thou didst write about Aqa Musa, one of the Children of Israel, upon him be the glory of God, after it was presented before Him from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden, these exalted words were revealed from the heaven of loving kindness, the Revealer of verses. He - exalted and sanctified be He - saith: […]</p>
<p>O Moses! There is no harm in your sojourn in Sultan-Abad. In outward affairs hold fast to consultation, then, trusting in God, occupy thyself therein. We beseech God to adorn all His loved ones with the ornament of trustworthiness, piety and chastity. Verily He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. It behooveth the people of Baha to admonish mankind through their goodly character and praiseworthy deeds. We make mention of those who have believed in God in this Revelation wherein the veils have been rent asunder and the signs have appeared. Blessed is he who hath turned with his heart, set his face, hearkened with his ear, witnessed with his eye, and taken hold of the Book of God with the power bestowed by Him and the might conferred by His presence. O Moses! Under all conditions hold fast unto God and place thy trust in Him. We have enjoined wisdom upon all. Blessed is he who hath clung to its hem by the command of God, the Lord of all worlds. We counsel thee to observe justice and equity in all matters. These two are the guides of souls and the guardians of existence from God, the Possessor of the seen and unseen. Blessed are My loved ones in the land of Ha and Mim. We have mentioned those who believed there aforetime with a mention that cannot be equalled by all the gold of the world nor the treasures of the nations. Verily thy Lord is the Helper at all times. There is none other God but Him, the True, the Certain. Rukni dwelleth in that land of H.M. We beseech God to aid him through the means of heaven and earth and enable him to achieve that which will perpetuate his remembrance. Verily We have mentioned his name and the names of My loved ones out of wisdom from Us, and We beseech the Most High to protect them from the evil of the oppressors, the cawing of the ravens, the allusions of the wayward, and the doubts of the deniers. He is the Single, the One, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We make mention of Mahdi and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him. We beseech God to open before his face and the faces of My loved ones the gates of blessing, bounty, glory, wealth and loftiness. He is the Lord of mankind, the Lord of the hereafter and of the former days. We make mention of him who is named Rahim and he who is named ’Ashur. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for them and for His loved ones that which will solace their eyes and gladden their hearts. He is the Helper of those who draw nigh and are sincere. O Shaykh! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. In truth, the Most Clear Book hath been specially revealed for thee in these days, and all the names mentioned have been rendered successful through the waves of the ocean of utterance. Say: O friends! Ye must be enkindled with the fire of the love of God and illumined with the light of His knowledge. Soon will the call “The departure! The departure!” be raised from every house. Strive ye, that haply ye may attain unto that which will endure and abide through the name of the Desired One of all worlds. Ye dwell in your homes while the Lord of the House is imprisoned. He doth witness and see, and He is the Mighty, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand praises and glorifications to the Desired One Who, despite the multitude of tribulations and imprisonment in the fortress of ’Akka, His sacred tongue is occupied with the mention of His loved ones. The trials of the world and the oppression of the nations have not prevented the Lord of existence from His bounty. At all times the waves of the ocean of His grace are manifest and the effulgences of the sun of His generosity are evident. All the loved ones, whether in that land or in other regions, are, praise be to God, remembered and are recipients of His favors. This servant is holding fast to the cord of His bounties and beseecheth for all that which will cause the world of existence to be filled with joy and delight. Furthermore, His honor the Name of God, Jamal, upon him be all the most glorious of the most glorious Baha, hath repeatedly made mention of that spiritual friend. This servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee to serve His Cause in such wise that all tongues may make mention […]</p>
<p>Regarding the honored Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God, who resides in that land - after being presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, these sublime words shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the All-Merciful’s utterance - blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O Leaf! God willing, may you be blessed with divine favors and be ever-gazing toward the Supreme Horizon. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you and those with you the good of both this world and the next, and to give you to drink, under all conditions, from the chalice of steadfastness. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over all things, and He is the Single, the One, the Compassionate, the Generous.”</p>
<p>Her petition reached the dwellers of the Pavilion of Infallibility. They graciously penned a reply which was sent. O beloved of my heart! Despite the countless letters arriving from every direction requiring responses, praise be to God, replies to your letters were sent successively, and all souls mentioned therein were blessed with the waves of the ocean of the All-Merciful’s favors. God willing, may they be assisted to achieve that which befits His days. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who have attained the sealed nectar and acted according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>O Life of the Throne, O Sun of loving-kindness!</p>
<p>None like unto Thee hath the world and all existence brought forth</p>
<p>Were mankind not veiled from Thy countenance</p>
<p>I would speak a word or two of the mystery of immortality</p>
<p>That all souls might be pledged to Thee</p>
<p>That all hearts might be enchanted by Thee</p>
<p>That Thou might behold a world intoxicated and enraptured</p>
<p>With spirits in both hands ready to be scattered in sacrifice</p>
<p>That when Thy command comes, O Pride of the Age</p>
<p>They might freely cast them at Thy feet</p>
<p>Rise like the sun from the mountain of the soul</p>
<p>That all might behold Thee clearly from every side</p>
<p>Show forth that moon-like face</p>
<p>And by Thy grace make verdant and fresh this handful of straw</p>
<p>A drop seeketh from Thy sea a Kawthar</p>
<p>Grant it, for Thou art the sovereign King</p>
<p>An atom beseecheth Thy light</p>
<p>Bestow it through Thy boundless grace</p>
<p>A seed hath opened its mouth toward heaven</p>
<p>That Thy bounty might descend upon it</p>
<p>Drop Thy mercy’s rain upon him,</p>
<p>O King of the Throne and Sovereign of all lands!</p>
<p>Rend asunder this hundred-layered veil,</p>
<p>And grant now sweet contemplation of that Face.</p>
<p>Since in Thy grace there can be no doubt,</p>
<p>Prepare for us a portion from Thy bounty.</p>
<p>Make now this west the dawning-place of all;</p>
<p>Grant now this drink the joy of wine divine.</p>
<p>Give to the heart’s light, light from Light of lights,</p>
<p>That they may witness from Thy face the rays of Sinai.</p>
<p>Come, draw that sword of God that Thou dost wield,</p>
<p>Come, smite these enemies of Thy Faith!</p>
<p>Kindle that fire divine that burns in Thee,</p>
<p>Consume in sweetness this contentious infidel.</p>
<p>All are as bats, O Sun of day!</p>
<p>Arise and burn away all darkness now.</p>
<p>Purify this pain-polluted draught,</p>
<p>Give light unto this night-quenched lamp.</p>
<p>A world stands firm through Thee, as Thou through Spirit live,</p>
<p>That through Thy Command may “Be and it is” appear.</p>
<p>O Thou the worth of my soul! In remembrance of Thy face</p>
<p>I speak unceasingly of Thy nature divine</p>
<p>That I may raise up souls from wisdom’s realm</p>
<p>To witness love’s pearl that wisdom hath found</p>
<p>I shall kindle a fire throughout the world</p>
<p>To burn away the veils of the sanctified ones</p>
<p>I shall draw forth the Maid of Inner Meaning from her chamber</p>
<p>And unveil the Light of the Unseen</p>
<p>A symbol of love’s eternal mysteries</p>
<p>I shall reveal, now that I have returned to life</p>
<p>Come graciously, O Bird of Fire, in utterance</p>
<p>That no trace of existence may remain</p>
<p>Cleanse these hearts filled with envy</p>
<p>And assay these hearts devoid of insight</p>
<p>That the unconscious of Thy covenant, O Gracious One</p>
<p>May awaken through that ancient chalice</p>
<p>Nay, through holy melodies, O our Beloved</p>
<p>Remove from us both consciousness and unconsciousness</p>
<p>O Seraphiel of Glory, O King of the Spirit</p>
<p>Grant the gift of life unto the dead</p>
<p>The first Lote-Tree was of the branches of the heart;</p>
<p>Free it from desires of water and clay.</p>
<p>That it may be detached from essence and attribute,</p>
<p>That from its candle suns may blaze forth.</p>
<p>Plant this sapling in the soil of the heart,</p>
<p>Then keep it pure from shadow and illumination.</p>
<p>Protect it from diverse winds,</p>
<p>And free it from the fancy of the idolater.</p>
<p>Make its roots firm in the earth of the soul,</p>
<p>Let its branch extend through heaven.</p>
<p>Bring forth a new springtime anew,</p>
<p>That these dead may spring forth from thy resurrection.</p>
<p>The surging of the seas of love from thy surge,</p>
<p>The consciousness of the birds of eternity from thy consciousness.</p>
<p>Waft the fragrance of the garment from the Egypt of the soul,</p>
<p>Make manifest here the Tree of Moses.</p>
<p>O Beloved, from Thy face came the spring,</p>
<p>From this spring came countless realities.</p>
<p>Every flower therefrom a book of the Friend’s beauty,</p>
<p>Every heart therefrom a fountain of His grace.</p>
<p>No autumn follows in this springtime’s wake,</p>
<p>All flowers circle ’round its holy space.</p>
<p>This spring draws not the soul into its snare,</p>
<p>But gives new life to every spirit there.</p>
<p>That spring brings forth the longing for the fair;</p>
<p>This spring brings love divine beyond compare.</p>
<p>That spring is followed by mortality;</p>
<p>This spring is named eternal destiny.</p>
<p>That spring from earthly seasons takes its rise;</p>
<p>This spring flows from the Loved One’s radiant eyes.</p>
<p>That spring brings tulips bursting from the ground;</p>
<p>This spring brings forth the heart’s lamenting sound.</p>
<p>This everlasting spring from royal light</p>
<p>Has raised its pavilion to heaven’s height.</p>
<p>All have entered beneath its sheltering dome -</p>
<p>Look well, if sight you have, make here your home.</p>
<p>When our King cast the veil from off His face,</p>
<p>This spring raised up its tent to heaven’s space.</p>
<p>When our Beloved dropped His covering,</p>
<p>Unveiled, illumined shone this endless spring.</p>
<p>We are lost in His countenance in springtime,</p>
<p>We gaze not upon the rose garden because of His face.</p>
<p>We are free from all remembrance through His mention,</p>
<p>We shine forth in the world through His sun.</p>
<p>If a breeze should blow from this sweet spring,</p>
<p>You will behold Josephs appearing before your eyes.</p>
<p>If a breeze should blow from this garden,</p>
<p>You will see spiritual Josephs in the world.</p>
<p>You will see bodies become like spirit,</p>
<p>While the spirit receives a hundred bounties each moment.</p>
<p>This holy spring of the Beloved has at every breath</p>
<p>A hundred utterances, but where is one who understands?</p>
<p>This utterance is sanctified above speech,</p>
<p>How can the unworthy grasp its meaning?</p>
<p>This utterance is not of words, phrases or sounds,</p>
<p>This utterance is soul and knows no death.</p>
<p>You will see lovers in this spring,</p>
<p>Offering a hundred thousand souls at every breath.</p>
<p>This is the spring of spiritual glory,</p>
<p>This is the holy, divine spring.</p>
<p>If a breeze from this Saba wafts upon thee,</p>
<p>Thy mortal soul shall drink the cup of immortality.</p>
<p>Should a zephyr reach thee from the Friend’s abode,</p>
<p>Sacrifice thy soul, for this soul itself is His bestowed.</p>
<p>Behold the tulip of Divine Unity in this spring,</p>
<p>See the hyacinth of detachment from the Beloved’s tress ring.</p>
<p>Seek the rosebuds of knowledge from this direction fair,</p>
<p>All in search of Him with passionate flair.</p>
<p>His cypress trees tell of the Beloved’s stature tall,</p>
<p>His verdant grass a scroll of His script withal.</p>
<p>His nightingales drunk from the cup of “Am I not?”,</p>
<p>His doves intoxicated by His beauty’s lot.</p>
<p>The nightingales, yearning for union with Him divine,</p>
<p>All enraptured by the breeze of His grace sublime.</p>
<p>Should this nightingale’s song become manifest,</p>
<p>The souls of creation would be purified from jealousy’s test.</p>
<p>The sea of meaning surged from this utterance true,</p>
<p>The heaven of existence from this bounty grew restless anew.</p>
<p>Every anemone that springs forth in this vernal day,</p>
<p>A hundred mysteries from the Beloved’s secret doth convey.</p>
<p>The musk’s sweet fragrance from the loved one’s tress,</p>
<p>His grace’s hand bestows on thee largesse.</p>
<p>Behold His locks like salamander shine,</p>
<p>As round the Loved One’s face they e’er entwine.</p>
<p>The holy nightingale, from Friend apart,</p>
<p>Such wails pours forth as rend both mind and heart.</p>
<p>If He should sigh from separation’s pain,</p>
<p>’Twould set the souls of chosen ones aflame.</p>
<p>Save those elect, none have this portion gained;</p>
<p>Let not this grace, beloved, be disdained.</p>
<p>From soul diffuse the holy musk divine,</p>
<p>That these base ones may catch its sweet design.</p>
<p>This springtime of the spirit shall endure,</p>
<p>Unlike earth’s spring that autumn doth obscure.</p>
<p>From holy spring the spirit doth emerge,</p>
<p>As Noah’s light from its pure air did surge.</p>
<p>The ark’s folk to heaven’s height He’ll raise,</p>
<p>Then grant to each a hundred realms of grace.</p>
<p>O Beauty of God, cast off Thy veil,</p>
<p>That from the west the sun might beam prevail.</p>
<p>Unlock the musk-pod of divine knowledge,</p>
<p>Open wide the treasury of hidden mysteries.</p>
<p>That these lifeless ones may catch its fragrance,</p>
<p>That these unconscious ones may be gladdened by its wine.</p>
<p>From Thy bounty, O All-Loving One,</p>
<p>Clothe this lowly one of the realm of unity with the robe of glory.</p>
<p>Attire this evanescent one with the garment of everlasting life,</p>
<p>Let this utter poverty taste the honey of wealth.</p>
<p>That he may emerge completely from behind the veil,</p>
<p>And tear away the shroud of contingent being.</p>
<p>Like a candle in its glass, may he come forth</p>
<p>Intoxicated and selfless in his return.</p>
<p>Since this thorn has sprouted from Thy rose garden,</p>
<p>Bring forth from it a hundred rose gardens.</p>
<p>Inscribe each rose garden with a Name,</p>
<p>Then in each petal reveal the mystery of eternity.</p>
<p>That the lights of Thy countenance may become manifest,</p>
<p>And Thy radiance may fill earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Generous One, send forth a breeze of mercy,</p>
<p>And rend asunder the veils of heedlessness from this ailing one.</p>
<p>Grant shelter, O King of all existence,</p>
<p>To pure souls beneath Thy sacred tree;</p>
<p>Open a gate from the spiritual paradise,</p>
<p>For God’s sake, bar not this door to me.</p>
<p>That I may enter, unveiled, into this world</p>
<p>To express a symbol of Thy grace;</p>
<p>“God! God!” He said, “O noble one,</p>
<p>Share not Truth’s secrets with the base.”</p>
<p>“God! God!” O Tongue of God, convey</p>
<p>These truths gently, with mankind agree;</p>
<p>Perhaps Thy grace will take them by the hand,</p>
<p>From fear of this and that set free.</p>
<p>Spread wide thy wings of meaning, take to flight,</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of nearness to Him soar;</p>
<p>His nearness dwells in spirit, not in steps,</p>
<p>When spirit-ward you move, you’ll reach His door.</p>
<p>Then in an instant, crossing realms of being</p>
<p>Becomes not difficult, when prostrate you fall near.</p>
<p>Let me tell thee a subtle point,</p>
<p>That thou may’st partake of the water of life;</p>
<p>That aware thou may’st be of the eternal paradise,</p>
<p>That thou may’st find a path to the realm of meeting;</p>
<p>That thou may’st grasp the meaning of traversing the earth,</p>
<p>That thou may’st soar in spirit through its atmosphere.</p>
<p>While thou art caught in the snare of clay,</p>
<p>How canst thou catch the fragrance from the paradise of the heart?</p>
<p>Therefore strip thyself of the garment of limitations,</p>
<p>And sanctify thy soul from all bounds;</p>
<p>Illumine the darkness of thy heart with His light,</p>
<p>That thou may’st become a sovereign in the kingdom of spirits.</p>
<p>When darkness departs His light doth shine forth,</p>
<p>The radiance of His Mount Sinai flasheth upon thy heart;</p>
<p>When thy night passeth, dawn appeareth,</p>
<p>And the breeze of spiritual glory wafteth;</p>
<p>These darknesses and that corrupted self</p>
<p>Are His water of life, the revelation of God;</p>
<p>If thou passeth beyond these darknesses of self,</p>
<p>Without effort thou shalt drink of the water of life.</p>
<p>Enter thou beneath the shade of the Life-giving Spirit,</p>
<p>That thou mayest be freed from this abode of darkness.</p>
<p>That verdant one drank and was delivered from death,</p>
<p>While this One bestoweth two hundred fountains of life.</p>
<p>He dispensed the Water of Life unto all,</p>
<p>Having offered His soul to the Peerless King.</p>
<p>That one strove hard and then attained,</p>
<p>While from this One a hundred springs instantly appeared.</p>
<p>That one ran in search of the fountain,</p>
<p>While unto this One the fountains themselves do flow.</p>
<p>O Thou Who art worth my very soul, return from this pursuit,</p>
<p>That Thou mayest capture a hundred thousand meanings.</p>
<p>Abandon the hunt of wild asses for their graves,</p>
<p>Bring forth the prey of meaning from the Mount of Sinai.</p>
<p>Thou didst capture the souls of lovers in the wilderness,</p>
<p>Until all souls transcended their existence.</p>
<p>There is no time for Thee to speak of the secrets of the rose</p>
<p>Before the nightingale, O Sovereign of Wine.</p>
<p>Release the falcon from Thy wrist, O Beauty,</p>
<p>That it may bring back meanings from that realm.</p>
<p>O seize now the Mystic Phoenix’s flight,</p>
<p>And unlock treasures with the Key of Light.</p>
<p>Now fulfill what Thou didst promise before,</p>
<p>O Thou whose Light fills earth and heaven’s floor!</p>
<p>With Thy springtime make the world fresh and gay,</p>
<p>Till Thy Paradise makes heaven’s gardens sway.</p>
<p>From Truths divine grant anemones fair</p>
<p>In this soul’s springtime garden, fresh and rare.</p>
<p>From every flower show the nightingale’s sign,</p>
<p>Tell kings of heart the wine’s secrets divine.</p>
<p>For here and now the unhallowed hold sway,</p>
<p>Yet hallowed and unhallowed share one way.</p>
<p>O morning breeze from the Beloved’s hair,</p>
<p>Bring spirit-musk’s fragrance sweet and rare.</p>
<p>O cloud of heavenly grace, pour forth Thy rain,</p>
<p>Till pearls within each shell do form again.</p>
<p>The tale of inner mysteries untold remains,</p>
<p>The mention of earth’s folding unexplained sustains.</p>
<p>So thou, intoxicated with pride’s cup this hour,</p>
<p>Transform thy selfish fire to light and power.</p>
<p>Until thou traversest the world in a single breath,</p>
<p>Until thou art freed from the prison of this cage,</p>
<p>Before thou enterest the shade of the Friend,</p>
<p>No knowledge hast thou of core or shell.</p>
<p>Thy spiritual feet are sunk in clay,</p>
<p>Unaware of the radiance of that beauteous Face.</p>
<p>When thou makest thy dwelling in the shade of the King of souls,</p>
<p>Then shalt thou detach thy heart from all the world.</p>
<p>In the first moment thou wert in dust,</p>
<p>In the last moment thou transcendedst the sun.</p>
<p>Then in an instant thou traversedst the worlds of spirit,</p>
<p>Know thou, O wayfarer, without taking a step.</p>
<p>Now a fragrance from the rose-garden of the soul</p>
<p>Hath wafted forth and perfumed all the world.</p>
<p>Again the musk of the soul from that paradise of bounty</p>
<p>Hath breathed forth and carried away all that was.</p>
<p>Consciousness and unconsciousness have here departed,</p>
<p>Drunkenness and sobriety all at once have gone.</p>
<p>Sobriety became effacement, and effacement too remained not,</p>
<p>The sober became intoxicated, and sobriety too remained not.</p>
<p>Whatever existed of names and forms in this world</p>
<p>Has vanished since my King became manifest</p>
<p>For names, though they should soar for two hundred centuries</p>
<p>Cannot perceive a trace of His power</p>
<p>What your eye has seen and your ear has heard</p>
<p>He came pure from all of these, O wise one</p>
<p>So with these eyes and ears, O sightless one</p>
<p>How can you become aware of the spirit’s mystery?</p>
<p>Open another eye to the new Beloved</p>
<p>Open another ear, then listen</p>
<p>The eye of the ignorant sees naught but feet</p>
<p>The eye of the gnostic sees the mysteries of eternity</p>
<p>The eye of the gnostic sees a hundred thousand years’ journey</p>
<p>The eye of the ignorant cannot see the face of the King</p>
<p>A seeker asked a gnostic one day:</p>
<p>“You who have fathomed divine mysteries,</p>
<p>You who are intoxicated with the wine of grace</p>
<p>Do you remember aught of the Day of Alast?”</p>
<p>He replied: “I remember that voice and word</p>
<p>Which was and is, and this is no wonder”</p>
<p>His voice is ever in my ear,</p>
<p>That sweet sound which quickens the soul.</p>
<p>Another mystic who had soared to greater heights,</p>
<p>Who had unveiled divine mysteries,</p>
<p>Said that God’s Day never ended,</p>
<p>We are in that Day which knows no close.</p>
<p>His Day has no night to follow,</p>
<p>We are in that Day - and this is no wonder.</p>
<p>Should its joy depart from the soul of time,</p>
<p>You would not see the throne and earth remain.</p>
<p>For His eternal Day, through His might,</p>
<p>Emerged imperishable from His presence.</p>
<p>So, O soul, hearken to this mystery,</p>
<p>And heed the counsel of divine secrets,</p>
<p>That you may receive sustenance from His wisdom,</p>
<p>That you may sacrifice your soul for His countenance,</p>
<p>That you may hear His melodies at every moment,</p>
<p>That you may drink a cup from His bounty,</p>
<p>That you may become aware of love’s mysteries,</p>
<p>That you may taste primal wine from love’s rivers.</p>
<p>I shall not turn my face from the sword of these base ones,</p>
<p>Even if these infidels slay me a hundred times over.</p>
<p>My soul drank of Thy wine from the beginning,</p>
<p>And in remembrance of Thee shall I yield up my life at the end.</p>
<p>O Baha! Kindle anew a fire</p>
<p>That shall consume the realm of learning and investigation.</p>
<p>Cleanse the soul of worldly attributes,</p>
<p>And unveil a mystery from the hidden secrets.</p>
<p>Cast forth a wave from the deep spiritual sea</p>
<p>That it may shatter the heavens of words.</p>
<p>Pour forth a chalice that I may be freed from self,</p>
<p>That like Safdar I may rend asunder the veils.</p>
<p>O Thou from Whose Name the Tree of Being hath borne fruit,</p>
<p>From Whose Hand the power of Truth is made manifest!</p>
<p>O Thou in Whose grasp lieth a world,</p>
<p>Now transformed, now stilled, by Thy decree!</p>
<p>Bestow light upon this candle and from it give light,</p>
<p>O King of the Moon, to these diverse directions.</p>
<p>How brightly hast Thou lit this lamp of Thine,</p>
<p>And preserved it within the glass of protection!</p>
<p>From the mouth of bounty didst Thou grant it aid,</p>
<p>And through the wick of Thy command bestowed growth.</p>
<p>From the wind of tyranny do Thou protect it,</p>
<p>That through it Thy light may be made manifest.</p>
<p>Cut short the enemy’s hand from its head,</p>
<p>O Thou Moon of Command and King of “Verily.”</p>
<p>Behold this lamp of Thine afflicted now</p>
<p>Amidst the whirlwind full of tribulation.</p>
<p>Since from Thy beauty’s light it gained its radiance,</p>
<p>Leave it not darkened in the realm of being.</p>
<p>Since Thou didst light it, extinguish it not;</p>
<p>Since Thou gavest it consciousness, render it not senseless.</p>
<p>O Thou through Whose love an atom becomes a sun,</p>
<p>O Thou through Whose wrath a lion becomes a sparrow!</p>
<p>The winds have blown from every side,</p>
<p>And this Thy lamp remains midst all, O Lord.</p>
<p>If Thou willest, water becomes as fire,</p>
<p>And if Thou willest not, fire in that moment turns cold.</p>
<p>O Thou through Whose wisdom a demon becomes like a heavenly maiden,</p>
<p>O Thou through Whose command light springs forth from fire!</p>
<p>If thou desirest the breath to become as a mouth,</p>
<p>Let it uplift the spirit and become a light.</p>
<p>O Baha’u’llah, when Thy fire was kindled,</p>
<p>It consumed the harvest of the being of lovers.</p>
<p>One spark from the fire Thou cast upon hearts,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand Sidrihs didst Thou raise upon Sinai.</p>
<p>Then from every heart Sidrihs appeared;</p>
<p>O Moses, here must one run with all haste,</p>
<p>That from the soul ye may behold the mystic fire of God,</p>
<p>And be delivered from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>O Sacrifice of God, from love’s altar</p>
<p>Turn not away, but give thy life in the path of love.</p>
<p>Without head and without soul come to the Friend’s lane,</p>
<p>That thou mayest be accepted by the people of this realm.</p>
<p>This is the valley of love; come, O Spirit of God,</p>
<p>Come by way of the cross, yea, even by the pathless way.</p>
<p>Pass beyond the heavens and the body’s ascension,</p>
<p>O thou who art King of the soul and Quickener of the frame.</p>
<p>Thou art the Nightingale of the spirit in the rose garden of the soul;</p>
<p>Return again, O thou Host of the spirit.</p>
<p>Come, O regal soul of poverty, come without price</p>
<p>Unto thy desired goal, for which thou dost yearn.</p>
<p>And thou too, O celestial Noah, break free from thy self</p>
<p>And cast thyself into the luminous sea.</p>
<p>Drown this self and seek not thine own preservation,</p>
<p>That thou may’st raise thy head from the collar of God.</p>
<p>Seek preservation from the King, not from the ark,</p>
<p>That thou may’st enter the shelter of the King’s protection.</p>
<p>And thou, O Moses, come to the Mount Sinai of the soul,</p>
<p>Leave behind thy sandals and thy cloak, come forth unclad.</p>
<p>That thou may’st become aware of the mysteries of the Fire,</p>
<p>For verily the Fire comes from the tresses of the Beloved.</p>
<p>His tresses are a Fire that burns the soul of love,</p>
<p>Both faith and unbelief are but the head and crown of love.</p>
<p>His tresses are Fire, prancing upon Paran,</p>
<p>At their very strands doth the neck of time bend low.</p>
<p>Cease, O Dove, from these mysteries of Fire,</p>
<p>Bring not the pearl of the soul before these blind ones.</p>
<p>This rod is a sword from the hand of Truth</p>
<p>That rends asunder the ranks of contingent being like a scroll.</p>
<p>From that garden’s tree the staff did spring,</p>
<p>While this staff by God’s command came to being.</p>
<p>That staff from water and clay emerged clear,</p>
<p>This staff from heart’s fire now doth appear.</p>
<p>This staff is fire whose radiant flame</p>
<p>Burns veils of malice, deceit and blame.</p>
<p>This staff’s a wind that in Hud’s day</p>
<p>Could true from false believers weigh.</p>
<p>That staff in Noah’s time became a ship,</p>
<p>In Jesus’ time, spirit from it did drip.</p>
<p>O Moses, thy fire from soul blazed bright,</p>
<p>To soul’s Mount Sinai take thy flight.</p>
<p>What are sandals? Pass beyond soul and faith,</p>
<p>Like wind through spirit’s realm make haste.</p>
<p>Soar from this transient place, O soul-bird fair,</p>
<p>To that eternal feast of beauteous there.</p>
<p>Moses’ fire from the Tree did show,</p>
<p>A hundred Jesus’ spirits from its breeze did flow.</p>
<p>That Moses’ fire from Sinai came to sight,</p>
<p>This Moses’ fire from soul takes its flight.</p>
<p>Among the mountain and the soul are many differences,</p>
<p>Evident as fruit from leaves.</p>
<p>His breast is Sinai, and His fire the Light of the Friend,</p>
<p>His palm the White Hand, and His heart His Mount.</p>
<p>This is not that White Hand which came from the Command,</p>
<p>This is that White Hand which brings forth the Command.</p>
<p>Now has appeared the Paran of Love,</p>
<p>Since our Beloved rent asunder the veil from His face.</p>
<p>The fragrance of the soul now reaches the nostrils,</p>
<p>I know not whence it comes perpetually.</p>
<p>This much I know: from the Beloved’s tresses</p>
<p>Wafts a scent that makes the soul scatter itself in devotion.</p>
<p>The musk-pod of divine fragrance has opened,</p>
<p>Our soul has become intimate with His remembrance.</p>
<p>O spiritual morning breeze, waft</p>
<p>From the holy Sheba of the All-Merciful!</p>
<p>That from thy ambergris-scent, intoxicated souls</p>
<p>May soar from the earth of existence to the realm of “Am I not?”</p>
<p>When the Phoenix of immortality from the Qaf of the soul</p>
<p>Took wing toward the atmosphere of “No-place”[…]</p>
<p>From one wing He traversed the realms of the world</p>
<p>Through the confirmations of the Sovereign of the Age</p>
<p>Now the Beauty hath returned from the celestial throne</p>
<p>His melodies exceed all reckoning</p>
<p>Through His rose-like countenance winter hath become spring</p>
<p>Through His ruby lips night hath become as day</p>
<p>Through His tresses the work of lovers hath grown long</p>
<p>All the beloved ones yearn in His separation</p>
<p>The proud ones’ necks are bound by His hair</p>
<p>The divine champion is needful of His arrow</p>
<p>The souls of lovers are at His lips</p>
<p>The souls of kings seek His presence</p>
<p>Through His beauty the eye of the spiritual soul</p>
<p>Hath become illumined, if thou wouldst well observe</p>
<p>Were His eye not in the world</p>
<p>How could the fountains of light flow forth?</p>
<p>From His rose many a rose garden hath appeared</p>
<p>From His face the flowers of meaning have blossomed</p>
<p>The fire of Moses seeketh light in His path</p>
<p>The soul of Jesus seeketh spirit from His countenance</p>
<p>Should He emerge one night from behind the veil,</p>
<p>A hundred worlds would shine resplendent as the sun.</p>
<p>Night exists but from the tresses of that Beloved,</p>
<p>And morn breaks only from the light of the Friend’s face.</p>
<p>The sovereigns in the city of love</p>
<p>Have sacrificed their souls for love’s sake.</p>
<p>From His beauty shines forth the Beauty of God,</p>
<p>And from His lips the heart drinks the wine of the soul.</p>
<p>The whole world is bound by His hair,</p>
<p>And for His sake all hearts are wounded.</p>
<p>When Zulaykha beheld that Beauty’s face,</p>
<p>In that station she cut her heart from her hand.</p>
<p>When He breathed but once from His spirit,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand spirits like Jesus came into being.</p>
<p>This is not His description, O possessor of attributes,</p>
<p>But the description of that Light from which He has life.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst comprehend the beauty of His description,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst pass beyond a thousand oceans of meaning.</p>
<p>If the description of but one ray be such as this,</p>
<p>What then must be His own description, O man of faith!</p>
<p>When the lover’s eye beheld His beauty</p>
<p>It severed its heart from both this world and the next</p>
<p>The waves of love’s oceans surge from His wave</p>
<p>The zenith of the spirit’s phoenix soars from His height</p>
<p>When your eye received light from His eye</p>
<p>It would be tyranny to turn to any but Him</p>
<p>When the eye of the soul has received light from Him</p>
<p>It would be a shame should it fall on others</p>
<p>Your eye has become manifest through God’s eye</p>
<p>That you might see naught but His beauty in the world</p>
<p>I’ve spoken this hidden secret, O friend</p>
<p>I’ve pierced this concealed pearl, O companion</p>
<p>That the evil eye might not fall upon His face</p>
<p>That none but He might find the way to His lane</p>
<p>Know this likewise of all thy members</p>
<p>That thou might be freed from the bonds of these creatures of darkness</p>
<p>When your ear heard His secret melody</p>
<p>It heard spiritual mysteries from His instrument</p>
<p>Since divine craftsmanship has become manifest</p>
<p>Fix your gaze on Him, away from the creatures of the world</p>
<p>If thou wouldst view the world through His eyes</p>
<p>Thou wouldst discern a thousand realms of spirit</p>
<p>His eye beholdeth naught save His countenance</p>
<p>His bird taketh wing only in His lane</p>
<p>From His union lovers’ souls are consumed</p>
<p>From His separation hearts’ fire is kindled</p>
<p>Thus doth the lover, bereft of life and head</p>
<p>Burn both from separation and union, O youth</p>
<p>Know then divine love as thy companion</p>
<p>That thou mayst soar free from this world’s bondage</p>
<p>Love is that which makes the soul to perish</p>
<p>Casting heart and soul into the eternal realm</p>
<p>Hear this mystery’s secret if thou wouldst understand</p>
<p>That thou mayst ascend to the divine heights</p>
<p>So thy palm tree might yield spiritual fruit</p>
<p>And give forth holy, luminous offerings</p>
<p>O breeze, bring forth a fragrance from His tresses</p>
<p>O cloud, shower down drops from His grace divine</p>
<p>That the garden of His lovers’ souls</p>
<p>May bring forth beauteous tulips of love</p>
<p>The loving heart becomes God’s throne divine</p>
<p>When purged of all save Him, with light to shine</p>
<p>When by His love His house is built anew</p>
<p>The house dissolves, and He alone shines through</p>
<p>Know that His house is not of stone and clay</p>
<p>The heart alone, O youth, can Him display</p>
<p>When cleansed thy heart becomes through His pure light</p>
<p>It turns to Sinai, blessed with holy sight</p>
<p>When God’s true house with love is filled complete</p>
<p>The Loved One’s glory there doth ever meet</p>
<p>Again love comes and burns the veil of mind</p>
<p>Learning and wisdom leave no trace behind</p>
<p>Since naught but Him exists within, O son</p>
<p>Know all His wisdom rules from sun to sun</p>
<p>Then know thy sight and hearing come from He</p>
<p>Who sees and grasps all things eternally</p>
<p>The mystic’s soul His farthest mosque appears</p>
<p>His nearest treasure-house of secrets bears</p>
<p>A fresh solution now must needs be found</p>
<p>This counsel in the soul must needs resound</p>
<p>Pass beyond both separation and union,</p>
<p>That thou mayest attain the highest heaven, O son.</p>
<p>While thou art in separation, thou art surely in flames;</p>
<p>And in union too art feverish and unwell.</p>
<p>Set foot in the pure realm of immortality,</p>
<p>Where all save Him is nothingness.</p>
<p>If thou hast read the words “God hath been,”</p>
<p>And seen the mystery “naught is but He,”</p>
<p>Set thy resolute foot upon this path,</p>
<p>To be freed from union and separation from the Friend.</p>
<p>When thou knowest with certainty from the soul’s mysteries</p>
<p>That none exists in between save God,</p>
<p>Then sweep away the straw from the water of life,</p>
<p>That thou mayest behold the radiance of that Pure One.</p>
<p>That thou mayest witness union within union,</p>
<p>That thou mayest see the light of Beauty in thy heart.</p>
<p>This is the union that hath no opposite,</p>
<p>Nay, separation existeth not therein.</p>
<p>Thy union and separation are duality, O son,</p>
<p>If thou wilt heed thy father’s counsel.</p>
<p>From these two summits soar aloft like the phoenix,</p>
<p>Until thou attainest the atmosphere of His divine unity, the King of “He is.”</p>
<p>Yet I fear thy feet may stumble,</p>
<p>And evil thoughts may arise in thy mind.</p>
<p>Hence it becometh necessary to expound this truth,</p>
<p>And uproot from thy heart the foundation of vain imaginings,</p>
<p>That thou mayest not fall into pride through this utterance,</p>
<p>And be delivered from arrogance, conceit, evil and tumult.</p>
<p>Know thou His union as His revelation in thee,</p>
<p>Which hath become manifest without how or why.</p>
<p>His light was His trust within thee;</p>
<p>Strive thou that it may be made manifest.</p>
<p>Therefore seek thou His union through thyself, O beloved,</p>
<p>That thou mayest never again see separation from the Friend.</p>
<p>Thou art also the treasury of divine riches,</p>
<p>Yet through heedlessness thou runnest after these others.</p>
<p>Until His attributes become manifest in thee,</p>
<p>Know thyself to be in separation and error.</p>
<p>Through His bounty He hath not left thee without portion</p>
<p>Of His attributes, names and tokens, O thou who art wise.</p>
<p>He through His grace opened doors for thee</p>
<p>Close not those doors as did the Jews decree</p>
<p>When thou heard’st the reed’s lament of love</p>
<p>Now recognize Him too through that same love</p>
<p>When thou heard’st the reed-flute’s plaintive call</p>
<p>Look to the Player, lest from Him thou fall</p>
<p>When the Player saw this world of otherness</p>
<p>He chose the reed as veil in His largesse</p>
<p>So rend this veil of thine for but a space</p>
<p>That naught but the Reed-Player fills thy gaze</p>
<p>Like Safdar tear away these veils that blind</p>
<p>That thou may’st see the All-Bountiful’s design</p>
<p>Like the reed cry out in separation’s pain</p>
<p>Till thy Reed-Player comes to thee again</p>
<p>When the soul’s Reed begins its plaintive song</p>
<p>The hearts of lovers surge and rush along</p>
<p>Light thou a fire from this reed constantly</p>
<p>Till in this world thou burn’st the “I” and “me”</p>
<p>When from the world the “m” of “me” is shed</p>
<p>Naught but the Reed remains when all is said</p>
<p>When thine eye becometh seeing through His light,</p>
<p>Thou shalt behold naught but Him, O thou insightful one!</p>
<p>Hearken then for a time unto these mysteries,</p>
<p>That thou mayest catch a fragrance from these rose-gardens.</p>
<p>A single spark from the fire of His love blazed forth</p>
<p>And consumed the harvest of kingly existence.</p>
<p>When His beauty drew aside the veil from His face,</p>
<p>The veil of majesty of kings was rent asunder.</p>
<p>When the arrow from His eyelashes struck,</p>
<p>It pierced the breast and soul of the sovereign.</p>
<p>The royal crown He cast from His head at that moment,</p>
<p>Became a servant and then fell into bondage.</p>
<p>Like prey he fell into the hunter’s grasp,</p>
<p>Or like a straw caught in a mighty wind.</p>
<p>If there be a messenger who would journey to Iraq,</p>
<p>Let him tell of the pain of separation and severance:</p>
<p>How from separation from Thee the souls of the yearning ones were consumed,</p>
<p>The arrow of Thy absence pierced the breasts of kings.</p>
<p>Between us and Thee, O City of the Soul,</p>
<p>A hundred thousand mountain ranges lie between.</p>
<p>There is no messenger save the burning sigh,</p>
<p>Or the morning breeze to carry the news.</p>
<p>O gentle breeze from the path of the Beloved’s presence,</p>
<p>Waft sweetly to the abodes of those of Zawra!</p>
<p>Then say to it: O City of the Divine Creator,</p>
<p>How doth thou remain, when thy Friend hath departed from thee?</p>
<p>Thy Friend is afflicted in bonds and prison,</p>
<p>Like Husayn in the land of Karbala.</p>
<p>One Husayn, and a hundred thousand Yazids against him;</p>
<p>One Beloved, and all these obstinate demons.</p>
<p>Like Moses amidst the Copts,</p>
<p>Or like the Spirit of God among the tribes.</p>
<p>Like Joseph, fallen into the well–</p>
<p>A well that hath no bottom to its depths.</p>
<p>Thy nightingale hath become captive in a cage,</p>
<p>And from this cage, even the path of breath is blocked.</p>
<p>While His hand remaineth far from its palm tree,</p>
<p>The soul, from separation, poureth forth oceans from its eyes.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath guided us to His most sublime horizon, Who hath given us to drink from the sweet Kawthar of His utterance, Who hath blessed us with His presence and reunion, Who hath honored us with attendance at the court of His throne, and Who hath permitted us, through His grace and bounty, to make mention of Him and to praise Him. We thank Him and glorify Him, and we beseech His forgiveness in all conditions. Verily, He is the Forgiver, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>And now, the letter from that honored beloved one, dated the eleventh of Muharram, was received and achieved the honor of being presented before and heard by the Lord of the World. By the life of our Purpose and your Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in earth and heaven! The favors, gifts and bounties that have been sent down from the heaven of grace and revealed verses cannot be compared to anything. Mind and understanding have confessed their inability to reckon them. Were one to liken them to rain or to the number of grains of sand or atoms in creation, these would prove inadequate. Thus it is proven by clear evidence and manifest proof that His bounties have no likeness or parallel, nor will they ever have. Exalted be His bounty, sublime His grace, great His sovereignty and mighty His utterance.</p>
<p>After being informed, We proceeded to the Most Great Throne where it was mentioned in His presence. This is what the Lord of Return spoke in reply - blessed and exalted be His words: “We make mention of thee and have sent down unto thee from the heaven of grace the Kawthar of utterance, one drop of which is not equaled by all the seas of the world nor the books of nations. Be thankful and say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!’” O Trustee! Thou art remembered; in most gatherings thy mention hath been made and hath flowed from the tongue of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto service and art freed from unseemly limitations. The Most Exalted Pen hath ever testified to thy service, love and acceptance.</p>
<p>In that which Haydar-’Ali (upon him be the Glory of God) had requested, thou wert in the right, for thou hadst no means, and debt is not viewed favorably. The essence of wealth boweth down before thy poverty, for thy affairs are referred to truth. We beseech God that thou mayest ever be illumined by the lights of the Sun of wealth and detachment. Accept the Rights of God from any soul who offereth them with the utmost humility, submissiveness, joy and fragrance. Otherwise, verily thy Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Observe what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “O men! Ye are but paupers in your relation to God, but God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.”</p>
<p>It is not advisable to tarry long in the Land of Ta. Make thy days therein like unto the days of roses in the garden. Permission was previously granted for thee to turn toward the direction of thy Purpose. Turn thy face toward God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. By thy turning, all created things will turn unto God, the Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs. Convey greetings to the friends in that land. Say: O people of God! The croaking of the raven and the braying of the ass have become loud. Protect yourselves through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. The Evil Whisperer of the world is engaged in spreading doubts. Strive that perchance the delusions of the past may not be renewed and helpless servants may not fall into the well of vain imaginings. For twelve hundred years they cried “O Imam!” and “O Successor!” and in the end they martyred One through Whose word a thousand Imams could be created. Fie upon them and their deeds and actions! They have committed that which neither the Jews nor any other people have committed.</p>
<p>The friends of the land of K arrived in perfect health and safety, and after circumambulating the Kaaba, they attained the presence of the Hidden Mystery. Happy are they and blessed are they. In the assemblies before the faces, the Tongue of Grandeur repeatedly made mention of that Beloved One, and each attained that which was recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the divine books. This evanescent servant begs confirmation and assistance for each one in preserving what has been bestowed. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Confirmer, the Helper, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about his honor N, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, praise be to God, he has been and continues to be successful. It is hoped that there shall appear from him that which will immortalize his mention in the Book of God. Especially at this time when I was in the Most Holy Court, mention of him flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. By the life of our Purpose! No mention in the world and what is therein equals His mention of him. Blessed are those souls who in this wondrous Day have been adorned with the ornament of His favor and have drunk from the ocean of inner meanings. They have truly attained all good. Blessed are they and those who have attained through their deeds and their love and their affection for Him. His is the grace and bounty in all conditions. Verily He is the Speaker, the Commander in the beginning and the end. On behalf of this evanescent servant, convey greetings, praise, mention and salutations to him and to all the friends of God. I beseech for each one that which God, exalted be His glory, has promised and revealed in the Book. Verily He fulfills His promise and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about his honor Aqa ’Ali Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God, praise be to God, he has attained the lights of the Sun of Truth and has drunk from the ocean of knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. It is hoped that he will become the source of great services, meaning the cause of the enkindlement of souls and that by which his mention shall endure throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm. What that Beloved One mentioned regarding his enkindlement with the fire of divine love and his arising to serve the Cause is truth in which there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the honored beloved, his honor Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, and likewise the allowance of his honor Aqa ’Ali Haydar, upon him be the Glory of God - this matter was brought before the face of the Lord of Destiny and attained the honor of His hearing. His blessed and exalted Word: “Those who spend their wealth in the path of God, these are among the people of the highest Paradise in the Crimson Tablet. The Concourse on High and the Supreme Paradise send prayers upon them. Verily bounty is in His hand. He doeth what He willeth by His command, and He is the Powerful Commander.” End quote.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention made of his honor Muhammad ’Ali Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, and the two brothers of his honor Aqa ’Ali Haydar - his honor Asad Aqa, upon them both be the Glory of God - praise be to God, both are mentioned at the Throne and have attained the favor of God, exalted be His glory. They have drunk from the wine of revelation and turned to the supreme horizon. This is from His bounty upon them. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Bountiful, the Generous. This servant also conveys greetings and salutations to the honored brother, his honor Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, and the two aforementioned brothers. I beseech God that in these days I may be enabled to send a reply to the letter of his honor Khan. The enkindled souls who are content and pleasing should at all times pray for one another and ask God to assist all to do what is befitting and worthy of His Day.</p>
<p>As to the mention of Aqa Muhammad-Rida, I beseech and implore God that He may assist him to praise and serve, and aid him in that whereby man’s station in the contingent world may be made manifest. Thus has the Tongue of God spoken before and will speak hereafter, for the Tongue of Grandeur has ever proclaimed this blessed word - He, glorified be His majesty, saith: “O thou who art present! Beseech God to assist His loved ones that the station of man may through them be made manifest and evident in the contingent world.”</p>
<p>And as to the mention of the land of K and Q-M and the brethren Aqa Muhammad-Husayn and Mashhadi Muhammad-Rida, upon them be the glory of God, they are among those souls who have attained unto the word of contentment from the Lord of Names. That beloved one should convey on behalf of this evanescent one greetings and glorification to them.</p>
<p>And as to the mention made of Aqa Qasim, another brother of Aqa ’Ali-Haydar, it was presented at a special time before the countenance of the True One, exalted be His glory. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur in reply - He, exalted and mighty, saith: “O Amin! The Most Exalted Pen testifieth that thou hast been and art occupied with the mention of the friends of God, and in every letter thou hast written to him who is present, there hath been mention of the chosen ones and the loved ones. May God grant thee thy reward and cause thee to attain His presence once again, that thou mayest hear what thou hast heard and see what thou hast seen. And as for what thou hast mentioned concerning Qasim, let him read what hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen at this time:</p>
<p>’O Qasim! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee for the sake of God and saith: When thou desirest to make mention of God, the Lord of the Throne and of earth, and the Sovereign of the hereafter and of the former times, arise from thy place, then turn thy face toward the Sacred House and say:</p>
<p>‘My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having wafted the fragrance of Thy knowledge when the Day-Star of Batha shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz and Thou didst raise the standards of Thy victory amidst all peoples. I beseech Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of earth and heaven and by Whose command the Kingdom of Names appeared in the kingdom of creation, to aid me and Thy servants to turn toward Thy most exalted horizon and Thy most splendid seat. My God, my God! I am he who hath acknowledged and confessed his poverty before Thy riches which have encompassed the horizons, and his powerlessness before Thy might at whose manifestation the power of the mighty ones and the dominion of the princes were rendered impotent. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of that which Thy Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for Thy chosen servants who were not hindered by the intimations of the Dawning-Places of idle fancies from turning unto Thee and arising to serve Thee. O Lord! Grant me that which will take all power of choice from my hands and cause the winds of Thy will to move me as Thou pleasest. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. Then cause me, O my God, to be detached from all else but Thee, to be immersed in the ocean of Thy mercy and forgiveness, to hold fast to the cord of Thy bounty and to cling to the hem of Thy generosity. Wilt Thou, O my God, turn away a poor one who hath hastened unto Thee, or a needy one who hath confessed to his powerlessness at the manifestations of Thy grace and the appearances of Thy mercy? Nay, by Thy Self! For I am assured of Thy power and might, Thy grace and mercy, Thy bounty and choice. There is no God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. There is no God but Thee, the Compassionate, the Generous.’”</p>
<p>This prayer is in itself effective in the world, for it hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed is he who readeth it and attaineth unto it. God willing, may his honor Qasim become the vanquisher of the ego and base desire, and with utmost joy and fragrance succeed in its recitation. This servant beseecheth his Lord to assist him and enable him to read that which hath been revealed for him.</p>
<p>Another matter: as commanded, that beloved one should not tarry long in the land of Ta. As to what was mentioned in the second letter regarding the honored brothers - upon them be the Glory of the All-Merciful - and likewise concerning the sum given to the noble matron, the Mother of the Sacred Precinct - upon her be the Glory of God - and their being set ablaze with the fire of the love of God, and their humility and submissiveness, and their services for the sake of God - all these matters were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court and attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. Each was illumined by the rays of the Sun of Divine favor. Blessed are they both and joy be unto them. They have ever been confirmed in service and adorned with His grace. I beseech the Most High to send down upon them such blessing from His presence that the rains of the clouds of His bounty and the lights of the Sun of His mercy shall never cease to pour upon them. Verily, He is the Answerer of prayers. Some of the requested papers were sent previously, and are being sent again this time. God willing, they will arrive and be delivered.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned concerning his honor Aqa Seyyed Farajullah - upon him be the Glory of God - and his accompanying that honored one: praise be to God, they were blessed with acceptance, attention, remembrance, praise, love and affection of the friends of God. His letters have repeatedly arrived, both to this servant and to His Holiness the Name of God - upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - and all were presented before the presence of the Lord of Eternity and were honored with the lights of the utterance of the Beloved of the Worlds. God willing, their reply will also arrive. In these days, as indicated by that honored one, on behalf of the noble leaves, the two daughters of the paternal aunt - upon them be the Glory of God - and the friends of God - upon them be the Glory of God - tea was served for several gatherings in the Sacred Precinct in the presence of the Beloved of the Worlds, and this was written so that all may know that whatever reacheth that honored one is being delivered.</p>
<p>The mention of Aqa Muhammad Big, Aqa Muhammad Husayn Big, Aqa Ghulam-Husayn Big, and Aqa Turab Big (upon them be the Glory of God) was presented before the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. He says, blessed and exalted be He: O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Praise be to God, ye have been honored by the effects of the Most Exalted Pen, and your mention hath been recorded in the presence of the Wronged One, and in the Tablets that which diffuseth the fragrance of eternity hath been inscribed. Know ye your station and preserve it in the name of the True One, exalted be His glory, for the people of the Bayan cling to the vain imaginings of the past and strive diligently to lead men astray. Glory be to God! Have they not witnessed the fruits of the deeds of the Shi’ih sect and have they not understood that they are once again clinging to the ways of that party? O party of God throughout all lands! Rend asunder with the fingers of power all veils, that ye may attain unto the lights of true unity. Today is the Day of God; none else is mentioned or existeth save Him. Take ye what hath been given unto you from God, the Lord of all worlds. Make firm your resolve, lest turbans and staffs and robes once again become the cause of vain imaginings and afflict helpless souls in the pit of doubts and fancies.</p>
<p>This lowly one conveyeth to each one greetings and salutations, and beseecheth from the True One, exalted be His glory, steadfastness for each one, that they may regard all else save God as non-existent and as naught, and may consider the doubts of the atheists and the signs of the opposers as if they had never existed. At this moment, before His countenance He saith, blessed and exalted be He: O thou who art present, write: O Amin, O Abu’l-Hasan! The Luminary of Batha and the Lord of Prophets (may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake) was sent by God unto all who dwell on earth, and diverse parties each spoke in their own tongue, and the differences of languages in the world are clear and evident and known to all. God, exalted be His glory, revealed the Furqan, which distinguished between truth and falsehood, in the most eloquent Arabic tongue, and it was a proof for Arab and Persian and Turk and the diverse parties of the world. And this language is potent and comprehensive; therefore from the Most Exalted Pen it hath mostly flowed and been revealed in this tongue, and at times in the sweeter Persian tongue. He is not bound by any limits. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Amin! The people of the Furqan prided themselves on the authority of the Furqan over the world, and the people of every religion on their Book, and the people of the Bayan on what they possessed. In this Most Great Revelation, like unto torrential rain, from the first day until now, night and day, verses have been revealed and evident proofs have shone forth equivalent to the books of the past and future now existing, and whatsoever shall appear in the future hath already been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen with utmost clarity. Nevertheless, they remain occupied with their vain imaginings and deprived of the effulgences of the sun of certitude. What hath afflicted their eyes and what hath prevented their ears? They play with their idle fancies and perceive not. By what proof do those souls who have denied this Cause seek to establish another? By the life of God! The Point of the Bayan lamenteth. The entire Bayan is like unto a ring upon the finger of the power of God, exalted be His glory; He turneth it howsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Those souls who have denied this Cause perceive not by what proof they would establish another. By the life of God, the Point of the Bayan lamenteth. The entire Bayan is as a ring upon the finger of God, exalted be His glory - He turneth it as He pleaseth and moveth it as He willeth. May God, through His conquering power, grant the sun of justice and fairness to emerge from behind the clouds of deliverance, that perchance the people may attain unto the hearing and sight that befit these days. The ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance hath surged, and the sun of grace and bounty hath reached its zenith. What station remaineth for the drop to make mention, and what measure for the atom to move? The Mother Book hath appeared and the Mother of Utterance speaketh. Exalted is our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Aqa Bala who is engaged in service to Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Haydar, upon him be 96 [Baha’u’llah], it was mentioned. His blessed and exalted Word: “Verily We glorify his countenance” and We beseech God to assist him in service to His loved ones and ordain for him that which is for his good.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to the friends in that land, namely the loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, and beseecheth God to make each one firm as a mountain and radiant as light, and to increase their vision and hearing at every moment that they may behold that for which they were created and hear that for which ears were made to hear.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa ’Ali-Akbar Bey, upon him be the Glory of God, and his enthusiasm and service in the Cause of God. Praise be to God, he hath been and is successful, ever arising to serve and speaking in praise and glorification of God, exalted be His glory. His mention hath repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen. At this moment his mention was made before the Countenance of the Goal of the world. We beseech God to open the doors of grace and mercy upon his face. Verily He answereth the prayer of the supplicants. Praise be to Him, for He is the Goal of the mystics. Glory, remembrance and splendor be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>6 Rabi’u’l-Avval 1303</p>
<p>He is God!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who revealeth and will reveal as He pleaseth, and He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. In one letter mention was made of the friends in the land of Q.M.?. and likewise of their being set ablaze with the fire of the love of God and their longing for the Most Exalted Horizon. Well is it with them and happy are they. Praise be to God that steadfast souls have been found and appeared in that land. Jinab-i-Haji Siyyid Khalil, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, hath ever been mentioned in the Most Holy Court. God willing, may those regions be illumined by the light of his steadfastness. Likewise Jinab-i-Aqa Mir ’Abdu’r-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors. Indeed, details about them and praise of that Beloved of all were presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and all attained infinite favors. This is what the tongue of our Lord hath uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing</p>
<p>O Khalil! The path is clear, the proof manifest, the evidence brilliant and the testimony evident. Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan have clung to the vain imaginings of the past. Reflect upon the heedlessness of these people. With their outward eyes they have witnessed the loss suffered by the people of the Furqan and observed the fruits of their deeds and words, yet they remained unaware and took no heed. Say: Take heed, O ye whose darkness hath taken the place of light! Take heed, O ye whose whiteness hath appeared upon your cheeks!</p>
<p>They are unaware of the Day of God and have not attained unto the lights of true unity. Your honor should strive with utmost effort, detached from all else, to protect souls that perchance the vain imaginings of the past may not resurface and be renewed. The tale of those who went astray and led others astray hath returned. They say what was said before. With perfect deceit and guile they strive to lead holy souls astray. The outcry that was revealed and recorded by the Supreme Pen in the sacred scrolls and tablets hath been raised. Observe the Most Holy Book and that which was revealed concerning Kaf and Ra. Today it is evident how Ja’far and his son, from among the people of Kaf and Ra, have turned away from the Truth and opposed Him, uttering that which no heedless one hath ever said. They have turned away from Him around Whom the Primal Point would circle, and Who hath said “I believe in Him and I am the first to worship.”</p>
<p>We make mention of the Merciful One in this station, glorify Him, and counsel him to the greatest steadfastness. My Name hath mentioned him before My face. We have remembered him with that which no remembrance can equal. We remember all My loved ones who have remained faithful to the Covenant. We beseech God to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions and to ordain for them that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that land! The Trustworthy One hath mentioned you, and We mention you as a grace from Our presence, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. The Wronged One of the world hath remembered you in the Most Great Prison. Were the fruits of this remembrance to be revealed unto you in the measure of a needle’s eye, you would arise to serve throughout your lives and would regard all else save God as non-existent and as naught. Glory be upon My loved ones who have not been prevented by anything and who have not been veiled by the veils of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Divine mercy hath so encompassed all that no description can reach it and no obliteration can touch it. The tongue is incapable of mention and the pen unworthy to race in this field. Another tongue is needed that might succeed in offering praise to His loved ones and become engaged in mentioning His chosen ones. Among these is the mention of that land. Whatever this servant heard from the blessed tongue, were he to attempt to mention it, he would surely find himself powerless and wanting. Exalted is His bounty and magnificent are His bestowals.</p>
<p>As to your mention of Aqa Mirza Ghulam-Husayn, Aqa Mirza Siyyid ’Ali, and Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Baqir - may the glory of God rest upon them - and likewise your mention of their ardor, steadfastness and devotion, you have indeed spoken the truth. In reality, these three holy souls have arisen to render praise and service to the Cause, and sublime and wondrous Tablets have been specifically revealed and sent to them. After this matter was presented before His presence, He spoke - and His word is the truth: “O Amin! These souls are remembered before the Divine Presence and have attained the favor of God, exalted be His glory. We have made mention of them with such praise as cannot be equaled by the treasures of the world nor by all that the nations possess.” We beseech God to make each of them shine bright as the morning star in the heaven of certitude. Soon will God make manifest in the earth the stations of those who have turned to Him and have arisen to serve the Cause whereby the foundations of every learned one were shaken, the hearts of every scholar were perturbed, and whereby the great terror appeared and all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Lord of the mighty throne. We beseech God to assist them in fostering unity and concord among the people of that land, and to aid them in spreading the Cause through wisdom, utterance, spirit and fragrances. Verily, He is powerful over all things. This servant also conveys to each one greetings and glory, and beseeches from God, exalted be His glory, the eternal and everlasting blessing.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of Aqa Muhammad-Rida of Muhammadabad - upon him be the eternal glory of God - and of his service to the loved ones of God, and praise was offered for his verses. This servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist him in deeds whose traces shall endure and persist, and to cause his flowing talent to stream forth in the rivers of His love. In truth, eloquence, articulateness, rhetoric and refined talent have been created specifically for the mention of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed is he and joy be unto him. This matter too was presented before the throne of the Lord, attaining the honor of His hearing. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak: “O Muhammad-Rida! By God’s life! Whosoever today has attained to a drop from this ocean and to a letter from this Book has indeed attained to all good, by the testimony of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the soul that hath not been hindered by vain desire from the Lord of all being, and that hath not been veiled by the veils of the people of the Bayan who have turned away from Him Who hath come from the heaven of divine will with verses that cannot be equaled by the books of the past and future. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this mighty and exalted station. Say: Look ye at the Tree and its fruits, not at what the tongues of the transgressors have uttered. Say: O people of the Bayan! Come ye, come ye, that I may show you the Sun shining from the highest horizon of the world. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. Say: Cast aside vain imaginings and idle fancies. By God! The Self-Subsisting hath come with a Cause before which neither the heavens nor the earth can endure, were ye of them that comprehend. By God’s life! We see the people of the Bayan to be more lost than the people of the Furqan, nay more lost than all the peoples of the past. To this testifieth he who hath been given insight from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken from the most sublime horizon. Blessed is he who hath heard and found the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful in the realm of existence, and woe unto the heedless. The glory shining from the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon the people of My ark who have not been hindered by the paths of idle fancy from My straight path.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-’Ali-Bahram, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, neither the croaking of the croakers nor the doubts of the atheists prevented him from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Glory be to God! Glory be to God! Souls have appeared who, in their unfairness, are without precedent from the beginning of the world until now, and have never come from non-existence into being. They have turned away from the ocean and abandoned the Kingdom of utterance, occupying themselves with vain imaginings and idle fancies. By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal, such souls have, since the inception of Islam, led people astray and afflicted them with vain imaginings and idle fancies. These matters are evident and need no detailed explanation.</p>
<p>In any case, mention of the aforementioned one has been and continues to be in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. Praise be to God, he has attained to that which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the divine Books. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to protect him and adorn him with the imperishable ornament of His mention, that he may be a sign of the love of God amongst the people and steadfast in service to the Cause throughout the nights and days. In all conditions, this evanescent one seeks divine confirmation and assistance for that beloved one, that God, exalted be His glory, may increase it every moment and cause him to attain unto new and wondrous favors. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things. May remembrance, glory and exaltation be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His majesty and His glory. Before the dispatch of this letter, two other letters from that beloved one arrived, one dated the twelfth of the month of Safar and the other the first of Rabi’u’l-Avval. Praise be to God, all attested to that beloved one’s steadfastness, service, recognition and devotion. All that was written was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. His blessed and exalted Word: “Verily, he hath spoken the truth.” Jinab-i-Amin is confirmed in service. In all letters he has made mention of the divine friends and their steadfastness, enthusiasm and devotion from N.J. and A.R. and Q.M.S. and Q.M. and K., and likewise has mentioned the friends in the land of T. and Sh. and Y. and other regions. May God, exalted be His glory, grant them all a reward through him. Verily, He is the Generous, the Bountiful. End.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah and Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ghulam-Husayn (upon them be the Glory of God), and likewise concerning their steadfastness, love and generosity which thou didst mention - all was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence and attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of Names. His blessed and exalted Word: “O ’Abdu’llah! The letter from the Trusted One hath come before the Wronged One, wherein was thy mention. We have mentioned thee with a mention from which every possessor of smell perceiveth the fragrance of the utterance of the All-Merciful throughout all creation. Exalted is He Who hath appeared and revealed what He desired through a command from His presence, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed is the soul who hath arisen to serve the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily he is among the people of Baha in the Crimson Scroll and among the companions of the Ark, the mention of which was sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Verily those who have spent in the path of God and fulfilled their covenant - these are servants whom God hath mentioned before and will mention hereafter. Every truthful and knowing one beareth witness to this. O Ghulam-Husayn! Thy name hath attained the honor of being heard by the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee this Mighty Tablet. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who acteth in accordance with what hath been commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you both and to aid you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to send down upon you from the heaven of grace and bounty a blessing from His presence. He is verily the Compassionate, the Bountiful, the Generous. The Glory be upon you both and upon every servant who hath attained to the service of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day.” Here end the sprinkling drops from the ocean of inner meanings. He hath received the two names, upon them be the Glory of God. Grace is in His mighty hand - He bestoweth whatsoever He willeth and giveth to whomsoever He desireth. He shall not be asked of His doings, and He is the Mighty, the All-Choosing. Again, the Glory and the Great Glory and the Praise be upon you and upon every one who is steadfast, firm, resolute, upright and unwavering.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>

<p>=== END BH00109 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00110 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most High</p>
<p>In these days, at every moment, the meaning of the blessed words “We shall make their highest their lowest, and their lowest their highest” is made manifest. All that was recorded in the divine Books of the past and present concerning the events to transpire on the Day of God is now manifest and evident. Yet the people remain veiled from comprehending it, for the ornaments of the world and its conditions have become a thick veil, preventing their eyes from seeing. Such heedlessness persists even while the world itself continually warns mankind of its own transience. With most eloquent utterance it declares that soon all that is witnessed within it shall change and return to nothingness. One of its calls is the thunder of cannons that rises from all directions, in an instant snatching multitudes from the realm of existence. Every possessor of sight and hearing testifies that its call is exceedingly loud and its message most potent. This call is manifested through the events that occur therein, betokening change and extinction.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! What has befallen the people that they take no heed and accept not the counsel of the counselor? They are occupied with vain imaginings and remain heedless of the Lord of all beings. They fancy themselves worshippers and celebrants of the Truth, yet the Supreme Pen cries out morn and eve, nay at all times, in its loudest voice, saying: “Verily, He is innocent of you, O company of the most lost!” Beyond this, all things bear witness, yet the people hear not. The sun of justice is veiled by the clouds of tyranny, and the countenance of equity is hidden by the darkness of oppression. One is bewildered as to what to say and who might listen. One matter has become the source of strength for the oppressors, while another has caused weakness among the just. Glory be to God! The people of deceit have attained perfect unity, clinging to it and thereby ruling over the peoples of the world, while the people of justice are seen deprived of this greatest bounty which is their special right. Although the unity of those souls is not true unity, still it has become the cause of their ascendancy. If the friends and chosen ones of God in all lands were to achieve unity, surely its light would encompass all horizons. In some places the fragrance of unity and concord cannot be detected, and this has been and continues to be the cause of the abasement of the Cause.</p>
<p>In any case, the letter of that spiritual beloved has refreshed the spirit, for from it was inhaled the musk-laden fragrance of the love of the Beloved of the worlds. After perusal it was taken to the Dawning-Place of the Most Great Signs and presented at the Most Holy Court, unto which nothing can be compared. His blessed and exalted Word declares, and may the spirit of all who dwell in the kingdom of utterance be a sacrifice unto its every letter:</p>
<p>I am the Sorrowful Speaker</p>
<p>O beloved one! There hath been sent down especially for thee that from which the fragrance of might and power and knowledge and utterance of the All-Merciful is manifest, evident and diffused. The Self of Him Who was promised in all divine Books through clear statements and explicit passages hath appeared and risen from the horizon of the world with the lights of His advent. Through His grace He hath made manifest the Path and guided all unto it. That which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen hath been revealed, and that which was hidden from all hath been explicitly mentioned. Nevertheless, the people remain heedless and veiled. Should all the world turn away from the Truth, no harm shall touch His Cause; nay rather, the turning away of creation is the cause and means of exalting God’s Cause, exalted be His glory. However, the grief and sorrow of the Wronged One stems from the lack of unity and agreement among His loved ones and friends.</p>
<p>O beloved one! Say: O people of the world! I swear by the Most Great Name that this wronged Herald hath spoken and speaketh for God’s sake alone, uttereth for His sake, and summoneth unto Him. He hath brought the equivalent of all that was revealed from the beginning of the world until the previous Manifestation, whereby the Messengers of God, exalted be His glory, established their proofs - nay, even more and greater than that. At last, observe with the eye of fairness and hearken with the ear of justice, that perchance ye may not be deprived of the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge, nor be forbidden from that which is sanctified above all similarity and likeness.</p>
<p>Say: If a soul humbleth itself before His loved ones for God’s sake, doth this diminish or increase his worth and station? Say: Perform deeds for God’s sake and fix your gaze upon Him. Whosoever comprehendeth this station and tasteth its sweetness will surely pass beyond self and all that he possesseth, and will become mindful of and act upon that which exalteth the Cause.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the friends in that land. Truly, the fragrance of divine love is inhaled from them. Blessed are they in having attained unto God’s testimony in these verses, which nothing that hath been or shall be mentioned can equal. Yet We have preferred some above others. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, may they strive that each day may be seen as superior, more exalted and more glorious than the day before. No matter hath been or is hidden. Verily, He Who speaketh is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. The breezes of divine favor waft during the nights and days, and the fragrance of the garment of His Revelation is diffused, yet no seeker is to be seen. Indeed, he who is deprived of sight is unable to distinguish and perceive. The Cause is in God’s hands, the Lord of the unseen and the seen.</p>
<p>The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto My good-pleasure and have testified to that which the Tongue of My grandeur hath testified in the kingdom of My utterance: Verily there is none other God but Me, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The lamentation and cry of God – exalted be His glory and greatness – melts the body and dissolves the bones. From the beginning of this Most Great Revelation until now, in most Tablets there has flowed from the Supreme Pen and been recorded the command to unity, harmony, love and fellowship, as well as spiritual qualities and goodly deeds. Nevertheless, in some cities and lands things are seen contrary to what the All-Powerful has willed. What a pity, nay a hundred thousand pities, that in these days – one moment of which cannot be compared to countless ages – man remains deprived of the cup of contentment and forbidden from the ocean of grace. Do they not witness the upheavals, conflicts and death of one another? Have they received from God a document guaranteeing their permanence, or do they consider themselves independent agents? This servant, and you, and the souls of that land must beseech the Self-Sufficient One with complete humility, submissiveness and supplication to adorn the sleeping ones with the ornament of awareness and bestow upon the heedless the robe of wisdom. Verily thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is He Who oversees all possibilities. He doeth what He willeth through His power and ordaineth what He pleaseth through His sovereignty. He is the Almighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>As for what you mentioned regarding teaching, God willing may all be successful therein, for after recognition of God – exalted be His glory – and steadfastness in His Cause, this is and shall be among the greatest of deeds. Blessed are they who attain! Joy be to him who found the fragrance of God before his ascension and recognized Him Who was announced aforetime. He is indeed among the people of this lofty and luminous station. We beseech and implore God – exalted be His glory – to adorn all the friends with this most glorious ornament. In truth, the divine fragrance of love is inhaled from the people of that land. God willing, may all lands attain to that which is beloved before God.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Mirza Nabil-i-Qaini – upon him be the glory of God and His favors – praise be to God, he is successful in that from which most are heedless and veiled. The testimony of God – exalted be His glory – which hath flowed and been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning him proclaims with the most exalted call among the people of the world: By the life of the Desired One! The passing of ages shall not change it, the succession of centuries shall not alter it, and annihilation shall not touch it. Joy and felicitations be unto him! O My beloved and O thou who art mentioned before the Beloved! If the people of earth would reflect even a little, they would realize that the welfare of all, outwardly and inwardly, has been and is to turn toward God – exalted be His glory. The heedlessness of the servants and their vain deeds have appeared in the form of various afflictions and have encompassed the earth. According to what was ordained by the Supreme Pen, these matters have been seized by the fire of wars and the smoke of tribulations, and that flame is hidden in the lands of Iran. And surely this concealment will have manifestation and appearance, unless by virtue of holy souls who are firm, steadfast, assured and upright the greatest calamities and mightiest tribulations be prevented. Verily, He is powerful over all things. However, most of what hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen hath become evident and manifest, as most have witnessed, and the rest will surely become apparent and visible. Heedlessness hath so encompassed the people of earth that […]</p>
<p>Tongue and pen are powerless to make mention of it. The tongue of this evanescent one’s heart is at all times uttering “Deliver us, O All-Merciful!”, and imploring His grace and mercy for all. For were He to unveil to the heedless what He hath unveiled to these servants, all would turn with heart and soul toward the Most Exalted Horizon and quaff the chalice of mystic knowledge in the name of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>As to your mention of Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], he hath attained unto that which is yet concealed from himself. This is a glad-tiding from this servant on behalf of the Desired One unto thee, O my beloved one, who art mentioned before the throne of my Lord. Some souls have won the race; God willing, may all attain to this station. From the day when, by Nimrod’s command, We entered into prison in this land until now, most of the notables of this realm have passed into oblivion, without trace, fruit, or mention. Nevertheless, those who remain are in no wise awakened. Glory be to God! Heedlessness hath become incarnate and hath prevented eyes from seeing and hearts from understanding. Would that they who have attained might know their stations, and that God, exalted be His glory, might cause all to attain this station. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Mention was made of those who are turned toward the House, upon them be the glory of God, His loving-kindness and His mercy. Praise be to God, they are reckoned among the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree and are turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. We beseech God to cause them to attain unto whatsoever wisdom requireth.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the beloved Haji Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be every most glorious glory, on a certain occasion these exalted words were heard concerning him from the tongue of the Lord of creation, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>“O servant! His eminence Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be My glory, hath borne many hardships in the path of God, exalted be His glory, and is engaged in serving the Cause with complete dedication. God willing, may he be assisted in teaching the Most Great News. May the True One grant capacity that the veiled people might drink from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s utterance and attain unto the love of God.</p>
<p>“O Haydar, before ’Ali! Thou art mentioned in My presence and art standing in service to My Cause. Thus hath the tongue of My grandeur testified at this time, even as We testified before and shall testify hereafter. We, from this station, pronounce Our glorification upon thee and upon those who have attained unto My sealed choice wine. Remember when thou wast sleeping and the breezes of My loving-kindness passed over thee and awakened thee in My days. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. Hold fast unto wisdom in all conditions. Thus wert thou commanded before and after, and at this appointed time. Blessed are they who aided thee and heard from thee that which thou didst utter concerning this binding Cause. Give glad tidings to My servants on My behalf, remind them of My remembrance, and pronounce glorification upon them from the True One, the Knower of things unseen.” End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent one also conveyeth another greeting to him. He hath never been forgotten and never shall be. Whenever they pass by the known hill, mention is made of him and of that day when they sought a promise from the Ancient Beauty at its summit, and likewise a group of the loved ones, and in that elevated place divine verses were recited. Praise be to God, the deeds of the sincere are ever remembered. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>In My Name, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Bountiful</p>
<p>As for your mention of the beloved of the heart, His Eminence Ibn-i-Ism’ullah’ul-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness, a brief letter was sent some time ago in response to their missive, and after several days another detailed letter was submitted and dispatched. God willing, may they ever be blessed by the fragrances of divine verses. For some time these parts have been deprived of the adorning of peace and tranquility, and therefore responses to the letters of God’s loved ones were not sent and remained delayed. Now for several days some measure of assurance has been obtained, thus letters are being and will be sent, albeit according to what is possible. It is known that in this land too some of the servants, in their ignorance, have intended to rise up against others, therefore whatever wisdom requires shall be done.</p>
<p>As for your mention of their eminences Mulla Ali and Ibn-i-Shahid, upon them be the Glory of God, and the friends in that land, as well as the sons of Khalil and the heirs of Kalim, upon them be the Glory of God - this was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. The Sun of the favors of God, exalted be His glory, has risen and shone upon each one, and some time ago mighty Tablets were revealed and sent. If opportunity permits and no impediment arises, this servant intends in these days to send correspondence to that sacred land. Convey my greetings to each one. God willing, you will relay these to each of them.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Furugh, Turbat, Faran, Rashkhvar, Hisar, the Land of Ba, that land, Shahrud, Bojnurd and Quchan - this was presented at the Most Holy, Most Glorious, Most Exalted Presence. This is what the Tongue of the All-Bountiful uttered to His loved ones in the lands, exalted be His grandeur […]</p>
<p>O beloved of the All-Merciful in the lands! How many nights did the Ancient Beauty turn His face toward you and reveal unto you that which surpasseth in worth all the pearls of the oceans, all the fruits of the trees, all that is treasured in the earth, and all that is stored in mines and mountains! And how many were the days wherein ye attained the traces of My Most Exalted Pen, and its rushing sound was raised in your remembrance in such wise that the dwellers of Paradise and the Most Exalted Heaven gave utterance! Glorified be the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens, Who mentioneth His servants that have turned unto Him with such remembrance as before it all remembrance boweth down. How many were the hours wherein ye were wrapped in the cloak of slumber while the Wronged One turned toward you with an eye that never sleepeth. Blessed are ye for having been immersed in the waves of the ocean of your Lord’s utterance, the Lord of all religions. Ye are they who have outstripped the world on a Day whereon the pillars of every learned one were shaken, the hearts of the mighty were perturbed, earthquakes seized the tribes of the earth, and the heaven brought forth its smoke. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified in your favor even as all things have proclaimed. Blessed are the people of Baha whose names have been inscribed by His Most Exalted Pen upon the Crimson Tablet. Thus hath the Command been revealed on this Day wherein tongues have been stilled and eyes have been transfixed.</p>
<p>Verily do We make mention of a land and say: Blessed art thou for having attained unto the remembrance of God in the beginning and the end. Thou art the one that hath been named by this Name from the tongue of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, at a time when the light of manifestation shone forth and the Speaker of the Mount spoke forth in the nights and days. It behooveth thee to glory in this bounty and to shine upon all regions. There hath ascended from thee one who stood firm in My service, who spoke My praise, who turned his face toward My countenance, and who drew nigh unto My horizon wherefrom the lights have shone forth. We make mention of him and those whom God hath related unto him, and We counsel them with that which shall manifest their stations among the people. Hold ye fast unto the Book of God and His ordinances, and cleave unto that which shall exalt the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines and jurists in Ta and Ra! Behold ye, then remember when ye were turning toward My direction in the nights and at dawn, when ye arose to make mention of Me and to praise Me, and when ye were anticipating this Day that was promised in the Books of God, the Lord of lords. Yet when the promise was fulfilled and the door of bounty was opened, ye turned away, save those who perceived the fragrance of My raiment and were drawn by My most sweet call when it was raised from the most exalted station. Rejoice, O My loved ones in that place, then make mention of Me at morn and eventide. Beware lest the affairs of the world sadden you or the doubts of the evil ones veil you.</p>
<p>O Faran! Blessed art thou for having been named with a name from which the sincere ones perceive the surging of this Fire that hath been kindled from the Blessed Tree upon the snow-white earth. Thus doth the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing make mention of you from the luminous spot, this station wherein the atoms proclaim that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. We make mention at this moment of the loved ones of God within thee and give them the glad-tidings of this bounty that hath encompassed the horizons. Preserve ye your stations through My Most Great Name and take hold of My Book with the hands of power. Ye are in your lands while the Wronged One remembereth you in His Most Great Prison with that which attracteth the hearts of the righteous. Blessed is he who hath taken My Sealed Wine in My Self-Subsisting Name and hath drunk thereof despite those who have disbelieved in the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Rishkhvar! The Chosen One remembereth you at a time when the fire of sorrows hath encompassed Him from every side. By God! He hath come with a power that nothing can prevent […]</p>
<p>The sorrows of the world do not hold Him back, nor can the nations restrain Him. He speaks and utters what He willeth with power and sovereignty. Know ye the value of these days; then remember your Lord with such remembrance as would cause the very rocks to speak. Blessed are ye and those who love you for the sake of God, the Cleaver of the dawn. O people of Hisar! Ye were blessed by My remembrance aforetime, and at this hour wherein the Ancient King is seated upon the Most Great Throne in the most ruined of cities - yet God hath rebuilt it through His grace and transformed the prison into the Most Exalted Paradise. Blessed is he who witnesseth and seeth, and woe unto every heedless doubter. We have remembered you once before and have written down for you from Our Most Exalted Pen that which shall immortalize your remembrance in the holy Books and Tablets.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of the people of the Palace who believed in God when the voice of the Herald was raised and the croaking of the raven was heard. Be thankful that ye have been mentioned before the Throne and that there hath been sent down to you from the Kingdom of utterance that which all creation cannot equal. We make mention of you and of your children and those whom We behold in the loins. Give thanks unto your Lord for this most great favor, then turn your faces toward the Spot before which all the sacred places of the earth have bowed down in submission. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Verdant Land! Rejoice within thyself, for the Lord of Names maketh mention of thee and giveth thee glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for thee in the Book. O My loved ones in that place! We have remembered you time and again, and this is yet another time, and the Ancient Beauty hath turned His face toward you from His Most Great Prison on a day which God hath made the lord of days. We have found from you the fragrance of My love; We have mentioned you in this remembrance whereby faces have been illumined and bones have quivered. Blessed art thou and blessed are thy people who answered when the Call was raised and bore witness to that whereunto God had testified before the creation of earth and heaven. They that have ascended in thee have attained the grace of their Lord and have been adorned with the robe of forgiveness. We behold them in all conditions and hear what their tongues utter at eventide and at dawn. We have favored some above others, and We are the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>We make mention of the land named Shahrud. Remember, O Land, when We passed over thee and shone forth with a light that illumined earth and heaven. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing. We arrived in thee when thy people were heedless, and after successive years had passed, We raised up in thee one who would remember Me by this Name whereby the hearts of those endued with understanding were subdued. Blessed is the soul that remembereth Me in thee, and blessed is the servant who hath arisen to serve My Cause on this Day wherein mysteries have been unveiled. Beware lest the pharaohs of the earth, who have adorned their temples with the robes of learning and have committed that which hath caused all things to lament and the very pebbles to cry out, fill you with fear. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and grasp the hem of wisdom, and proclaim the Cause of your Lord with joy and fragrance.</p>
<p>O people of Ba and Shin! Remember when there appeared from among you one who arose to serve the Cause in such wise as to cause the limbs of the earth to quake and the foundations of all lands to tremble. He is the helper whose assistance was attested by the Tongue of Grandeur, and in whose praise there hath spoken that which was created by the Word of God, the Sender of the winds.</p>
<p>O Land of Ba! We have manifested from thee Our treasure and adorned it with Our first ornament, and sent it forth with power and authority. Through it were hoisted the banners of unity and raised the standards of oneness, and the Cock of the Throne crowed, and the Dove of the Cause warbled upon the branches. O My loved ones therein! Rejoice ye to remember Him Whom God hath remembered through that which My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken in the most sublime station. Know ye that what ye sent hath been presented before Us and hath been honored with the lights of acceptance, a bounty from God, the Lord of all men. We have mentioned every name that hath served the Cause in the days of God, the Manifestor of clear proofs. Blessed are ye, and joy be unto you, for ye have shown patience. God will soon exalt your stations and names in the earth. He, verily, is the All-Merciful, the Most Generous. By My life! The breezes of My favor waft over you, and from you We inhale the fragrance of My shirt which hath diffused its perfume through My Name, the All-Pervading throughout all regions. Be thankful unto God for this Most Great Remembrance, and place your trust in Him under all conditions. We make mention of the Land of Ba and Jim that there may appear therein what God, the Knower of the seen and unseen, hath desired. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My days, who hath arisen to serve Me, who hath spoken My praise and hath turned unto My horizon whereby the regions were illumined. O people of Ba and Jim! Arise above heedlessness and desire. By God! The Lord of all beings hath come on a Day whereon the earth hath quaked and the mountains have passed away. Beware lest the world debar you from the Sovereign of the hereafter and the former times. Cast away what the people possess and hold fast unto that which hath been sent down from the All-Merciful. We counsel the loved ones of God to be trustworthy and sincere, and to act in ways that will elevate the station of man. O Land of Qaf and Vav (Quchan)! Is there in thee one who remembereth Me, and hast thou been blessed by the breaths of My loved ones whom neither the conditions of the earth can weaken nor the hosts of the wicked frighten? O thou Land! Remember thy Lord: Hath the fire of My love been extinguished in thee, and hath he who was steadfast in My service and who spoke My praise - whereby the atoms cried out “The kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the beginning and the end” - grown heedless? And We make mention of the cities whose names have not been mentioned; verily He is the All-Merciful, the Most Generous. O people of Kha! The Lord of Names remembereth you and giveth you glad tidings of His mercy and His loving-kindness. He, verily, is the Most Generous, the Ancient of Days. He remembereth him who remembereth Him, and turneth unto him who hath turned unto Him, as a bounty from His presence; and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. This is a Day whereon the Most Great Ocean hath surged and the river of thy Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, hath flowed. Deprive not yourselves of that which hath appeared in creation, and follow not every ignorant doubter. Cast the world behind you, clinging to the hem of the robe of God, the Lord of this mighty Day. The world hath been illumined by the lights of My Most Great Name, yet most of the people are heedless.</p>
<p>O ye who are transported with joy! Rejoice in that the Countenance of God hath turned towards you from this exalted horizon with such effulgent rays as have illumined earth and heaven and set aglow the hearts of them that have drawn nigh. We have made mention of you aforetime in words that no created thing in the kingdom of names can rival, and now We make mention of you in this remembrance which draweth you nearer unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We make mention of you in that which shall profit you in all the worlds of God - to this every discerning soul beareth witness. Blessed is he who hath been set aflame by the fire of the Tree of My Cause, who hath arisen to serve Me and hath spoken forth My beauteous remembrance.</p>
<p>O ye who are faithful! This is the Day whereon the rustling of the Sadratu’l-Muntaha and the flowing of the Kawthar of life are heard throughout all creation. Drink ye thereof in My Name, the Almighty, the Powerful. Beware lest the veils of the divines withhold you from the Lord of all names, or the clamor of the objectors, who have broken God’s Covenant and His Testament and have followed every accursed satan, debar you.</p>
<p>O concourse of divines! Come, come, that I may show you what your eyes have never seen and cause you to hear what your ears have never heard. Fear God, then judge with fairness this Cause, at Whose appearance all things have proclaimed: “Blessed be the Lord of Names, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty.” At this moment We make mention of My servant Ahmad, who gave the people glad tidings of this Most Great Name. He awaited My days and informed the people of My manifestation, and ascended before dawn unto the Most Exalted Companion, attaining that which was ordained for him by One mighty and faithful. Through him the sweet savors of divine knowledge were wafted among the servants - to this the Lord of creation, Who speaketh in this glorious station, beareth witness. We have mentioned him in numerous Tablets in such wise as hath brought joy to the eyes of them that are nigh.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Aqa before Ba’, who recognized the Most Great Name and responded to his Lord when the Call was raised betwixt earth and heaven. He was not shaken by the earthquakes of the earth, nor was he veiled by the veils of the divines, nor did he hesitate in this Most Great, Most Holy, Mighty, and Wondrous Cause. He attained true knowledge when the All-Merciful came with an authority before which the hosts of earth and heaven could not stand - to this every just and knowing one beareth witness.</p>
<p>O thou who bearest this name! Rejoice in that the Supreme Pen maketh mention of thee and saith: The first remembrance that issued from the mouth of the Will of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious, be upon thee, O thou who didst turn to the Most Exalted Horizon and didst cling to the hem of grandeur when people were in manifest confusion. I bear witness that thou didst turn thy face to the Countenance of God after the passing of all things, and didst believe in the One, the All-Informed. The rapture of thy Lord’s utterance seized thee in such wise that thou didst turn and acknowledge that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken before the creation of the world: “There is none other God but Me, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” Thou didst arise in the love of God when the feet of the nations had slipped, save whom God pleased - thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. God hath forgiven thee at the time of thine ascension, purified thee, and admitted thee into an exalted station. Blessed is he who remembereth thee with that wherewith the Tongue of Grandeur hath remembered thee. Verily thy Lord is the Rememberer, the All-Wise. Peace be upon thee, and glory be upon thee, and light be upon thee, inasmuch as thou didst believe in God when He appeared in truth and didst drink His choice sealed wine in His Name, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Thus have We adorned the pages of the Book of Knowledge with the suns of remembrance and utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>If all who dwell on earth and whatsoever hath been ordained, created and is visible therein were to become tongues and endeavor forever to render thanks unto God, exalted be His glory, could they succeed? Nay, by Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! Never could anyone adequately render thanks for this supreme bounty and mighty favor. He is ever engaged in mentioning His loved ones. Who can reckon what hath been revealed from His Most Exalted Pen for His chosen ones, His loved ones, His trusted ones and His servants? We beseech the Exalted One to make aware the peoples of the earth and not deprive them of this greatest bounty. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the All-Conquering, the Almighty.</p>
<p>As to the mention that was made of the honored Afnan, upon them be His most glorious Baha, these exalted words were revealed some time ago from the Dayspring of utterance, the Lord of Names. He, exalted be His glory, saith: O thou who art present! These blessed, steadfast and enkindled souls have turned with utmost love, spirit and fragrance toward the Court of God. They have moved for the sake of God and emigrated in His path. This holy turning has been from God and unto God shall it return. They have turned from their earthly home to the most exalted habitation, the seat of the throne of the Lord of Names. They have chosen exile in My path and hardship and tribulation for My remembrance and love. O thou who art present! Though they have borne mighty tribulations, yet by My life these are as naught compared to the ordained reward. God willing, may they attain to what God hath intended for them and be thankful for whatsoever hath befallen them. Blessed are they and blessed is he who loveth them and he who holdeth fast unto them, for God hath related them unto Himself and made them of the Afnan, and hath preferred some of them above others. Verily, He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>That which was recorded in the Tablet of Fu’ad from the utterances of God, exalted be His glory, this evanescent one hath mentioned, otherwise who can reckon what descendeth from the kingdom of the will of our Lord, and who can transcribe that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth at all times save through His grace, His might, His bounty and His all-pervading existence? This evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to all the friends of God and giveth them glad tidings of that which rejoiceth hearts and delighteth eyes. God willing, may the warmth of divine love adorn the body of separation with the garment of unity and concord. Verily, He hath commanded and commandeth all with that which profiteth them, and He hath counseled them in most of the Tablets to unity and harmony. How excellent is the reward of them that act! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. May the glory shining from the horizon of eternity rest upon thee and upon those who are there and upon them who hold fast to the cord of God, the Strong One.</p>

<p>He is the One Who speaketh through the power of Truth in the Kingdom of Utterance</p>
<p>O ye the embodiments of justice and equity and the manifestations of uprightness and of heavenly bounties! In tears and lamenting, this Wronged One calleth aloud and saith: O God, my God! Adorn the heads of Thy loved ones with the crown of detachment and attire their temples with the raiment of righteousness. It behoveth the people of Baha to render the Lord victorious through the power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their goodly deeds and character, inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence than words.</p>
<p>O Haydar ‘Ali! Upon thee be the praise of God and His glory. Say: Honesty, virtue, wisdom and a saintly character redound to the exaltation of man, while dishonesty, imposture, ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his abasement. By My life! Man’s distinction lieth not in ornaments or wealth, but rather in virtuous behaviour and true understanding. Most of the people in Persia are steeped in deception and idle fancy. How great the difference between the condition of these people and the station of such valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names and pitched their tents upon the shores of the ocean of detachment. Indeed none but a few of the existing generation hath yet earned the merit of hearkening unto the warblings of the doves of the all-highest Paradise. ’Few of My servants are truly thankful.’</p>
<p>People for the most part delight in superstitions. They regard a single drop of the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they deprive themselves of the inner reality and by clinging to vain imaginings they are kept back from the Dayspring of heavenly signs. God grant you may be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter the idols of superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men. Authority lieth in the grasp of God, the Fountainhead of revelation and inspiration and the Lord of the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p>We heard that which the person in question hath mentioned regarding certain teachers of the Faith. Indeed he hath spoken truly. Some heedless souls roam the lands in the name of God, actively engaged in ruining His Cause, and call it promoting and teaching the Word of God; and this notwithstanding that the qualifications of the teachers of the Faith, like unto stars, shine resplendent throughout the heavens of the divine Tablets. Every fair-minded person testifieth and every man of insight is well aware that the One true God - exalted be His glory - hath unceasingly set forth and expounded that which will elevate the station and will exalt the rank of the children of men.</p>
<p>The people of Baha burn brightly amidst the gatherings even as a candle and hold fast unto that which God hath […]</p>
<p>This station standeth supreme above all stations. Well is it with him who hath cast away the things that the people of the world possess, yearning for that which pertaineth unto God, the Sovereign Lord of eternity.</p>
<p>Say: O God, my God! Thou beholdest me circling round Thy Will with mine eyes turned towards the horizon of Thy bounty, eagerly awaiting the revelation of the effulgent splendours of the sun of Thy favours. I beg of Thee, O Beloved of every understanding heart and the Desire of such as have near access unto Thee, to grant that Thy loved ones may become wholly detached from their own inclinations, holding fast unto that which pleaseth Thee. Attire them, O Lord, with the robe of righteousness and illumine them with the splendours of the light of detachment. Summon then to their assistance the hosts of wisdom and utterance that they may exalt Thy Word amongst Thy creatures and proclaim Thy Cause amidst Thy servants. Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all affairs. No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned thy gaze towards My face! In these days there occurred that which hath plunged Me into dire sadness. Certain wrong-doers who profess allegiance to the Cause of God committed such deeds as have caused the limbs of sincerity, of honesty, of justice, of equity to quake. One known individual to whom the utmost kindness and favour had been extended perpetrated such acts as have brought tears to the eye of God. Formerly We uttered words of warning and premonition, then for a number of years We kept the matter secret that haply he might take heed and repent. But all to no purpose. In the end he bent his energies upon vilifying the Cause of God before the eyes of all men. He tore the veil of fairness asunder and felt sympathy neither for himself nor for the Cause of God. Now, however, the deeds of certain individuals have brought sorrows far more grievous than those which the deeds of the former had caused. Beseech thou God, the True One, that He may graciously enable the heedless to retract and repent. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>In these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto unity and concord and to labour diligently in promoting the Cause of God, that perchance the wayward souls may attain that which will lead unto abiding prosperity.</p>
<p>In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness. Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on their insight and knowledge. Among them are mystics who bear allegiance […]</p>
<p>The rays emanate from the sun and reveal its nature, but are not the sun itself. Whatsoever can be discerned on earth amply demonstrateth the power of God, His knowledge and the outpourings of His bounty, while He Himself is immeasurably exalted above all creatures. Christ saith: ‘Thou hast granted to children that whereof the learned and the wise are deprived.’ The sage of Sabzivar hath said: ‘Alas! Attentive ears are lacking, otherwise the whisperings of the Sinaic Bush could be heard from every tree.’ In a Tablet to a man of wisdom who had made enquiry as to the meaning of Elementary Reality, We addressed this famous sage in these words: ‘If this saying is truly thine, how is it that thou hast failed to hearken unto the Call which the Tree of Man hath raised from the loftiest heights of the world? If thou didst hear the Call yet fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain heedless to it, thou art such a person as hath never been nor is worthy of mention; if thou hast not heard it, then thou art bereft of the sense of hearing.’ In brief, such men are they whose words are the pride of the world, and whose deeds are the shame of the nations. Verily We have sounded the Trumpet which is none other than My Pen of Glory, and lo, mankind hath swooned away before it, save them whom God pleaseth to deliver as a token of His grace. He is the Lord of bounty, the Ancient of Days. Say: O concourse of divines! Pronounce ye censure against this Pen unto which, as soon as it raised its shrill […]</p>
<p>O mankind, the fear of God is the source of all good qualities in man and his true guardian. Happy is he who is adorned therewith and woe betide him who giveth not heed thereto.</p>
<p>On this Day when the Day Star of true understanding hath risen above the horizon of God’s Holy Dispensation We have decreed that every son shall learn some craft or profession, regarding such an occupation as identical with the worship of God. This is a bounty from God in this Day. In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man and a source of glory, grace, joy, exaltation, cheer and gladness unto him. Happy is the man who cleaveth unto it and woe to him who turneth away therefrom.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the utmost in acquiring the art of reading and writing. Writing skills that will serve them in their life are among the most praiseworthy accomplishments of man. When children are still small they should study those branches of knowledge which will profit them, that both they themselves may derive benefits therefrom and may also impart them to others. What is meant by this is that they should acquire the knowledge which may prove beneficial to the peoples of the earth.</p>
<p>Truly I say: Whatever diminisheth fear diminisheth wisdom. Fear is essential to right conduct and what is essential to order must not be ignored. In truth, among all men they that fear none but God and take pride in naught but what He exalteth are accounted among the departed ere their departure.</p>
<p>[…] rank before the Concourse on High. It behoveth all to aid such just sovereigns. Blessed is that ruler who checketh the reins of his passion, who restraineth his anger and preferreth justice and fairness to injustice and tyranny.</p>
<p>The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the fifth leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: Above all else, the greatest gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be Wisdom. It is man’s unfailing Protector. It aideth him and strengtheneth him. Wisdom is God’s Emissary and the Revealer of His Name the All-Wise. Through it the loftiness of man’s station is made manifest and evident. It is all-knowing and the foremost Teacher in the school of existence. It is the Guide and is invested with high distinction. Thanks to its educating influence earthly beings have become imbued with a gem-like spirit which outshineth the heavens. In the city of justice it is the unrivalled Speaker Who, in the year nine, illumined the world with the joyful tidings of this Revelation. And it was this peerless Source of wisdom that, at the beginning of the foundation of the world, ascended the stair of inner meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance, through the operation of the divine Will, proclaimed two words. The first heralded the promise of reward, while the second voiced the ominous warning of punishment. The promise gave rise to hope and the warning begat fear. Thus the basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin principles. Exalted is the Lord of Wisdom, the Possessor of Great Bounty.</p>
<p>[As this text is already in English, no translation is needed. The text appears to be from Tablets of Baha’u’llah and consists of passages from the fifth and sixth leaves of the Most Exalted Paradise.]</p>
<p>Thus hath the Tongue of this Wronged One spoken from His Most Great Prison. The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the seventh leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: O ye men of wisdom among nations! Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your gaze upon unity. Cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the wellbeing and tranquillity of all mankind. This span of earth is but one homeland and one habitation. It behoveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and to set your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony. In the estimation of the people of Baha man’s glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct, his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or rank. O people of the earth! Appreciate the value of this heavenly word. Indeed it may be likened unto a ship for the ocean of knowledge and a shining luminary for the realm of perception.</p>
<p>The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the eighth leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: Schools must first train the children in the principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry. It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient. We have formerly ordained that people should converse in two languages, yet efforts must be made to reduce them to one, likewise the scripts of the world, that men’s lives may not be dissipated and wasted in learning divers languages. Thus the whole earth would come to be regarded as one city and one land.</p>
<p>The word of God which the Supreme Pen hath recorded on the ninth leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil. Consider the civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been devised, and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its like none hath ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such deeply-rooted and overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the world unite in pursuit of one common aim and embrace one universal faith. Incline your ears unto […]</p>
<p>of the Most Exalted Paradise is the following: O people of the earth! Living in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable in the presence of God. It behooveth them that are endued with insight and understanding to observe that which will cause joy and radiance. Such practices as are sprung from the loins of idle fancy or are begotten of the womb of superstition ill beseem men of knowledge. In former times and more recently some people have been taking up their abodes in the caves of the mountains while others have repaired to graveyards at night. Say, give ear unto the counsels of this Wronged One. Abandon the things current amongst you and adopt that which the faithful Counsellor biddeth you. Deprive not yourselves of the bounties which have been created for your sake.</p>
<p>Charity is pleasing and praiseworthy in the sight of God and is regarded as a prince among goodly deeds. Consider ye and call to mind that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: ‘They prefer them before themselves, though poverty be their own lot. And with such as are preserved from their own covetousness shall it be well.’ Viewed in this light, the blessed utterance above is, in truth, the day-star of utterances. Blessed is he who preferreth his brother before himself. Verily, such a man is reckoned, by virtue of the Will of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, with the people of Baha who dwell in the Crimson Ark.</p>
<p>the eleventh leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: We enjoin upon them that are the emblems of His names and attributes to firmly adhere henceforth unto that which hath been set forth in this Most Great Revelation, not to allow themselves to become the cause of strife, and, until the end that knoweth no end, to keep their eyes directed towards the dayspring of these resplendent words which have been recorded in this Tablet. Strife leads to bloodshed and provokes commotion amongst people. Hearken ye unto the Voice of this Wronged One and deviate not therefrom.</p>
<p>Were anyone to ponder in his heart that which hath, in this Revelation, streamed forth from the Pen of Glory, he would be assured that whatever this Wronged One hath affirmed He hath had no intention of establishing any position or distinction for Himself. The purpose hath rather been to attract the souls, through the sublimity of His words, unto the summit of transcendent glory and to endow them with the capacity of perceiving that which will purge and purify the peoples of the world from the strife and dissension which religious differences provoke. Unto this bear witness My heart, My Pen, My inner and […]</p>
<p>My outer Being. God grant that all men may turn unto the treasuries latent within their own beings. O people of Baha! The source of crafts, sciences and arts is the power of reflection. Make ye every effort that out of this ideal mine there may gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utterance as will promote the well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of the earth. Under all conditions, whether in adversity or at ease, whether honoured or afflicted, this Wronged One hath directed all men to show forth love, affection, compassion and harmony. And yet whenever there was any slight evidence of progress and advancement, those concealed behind the veils would sally forth and utter calumnies more wounding than the sword. They cling unto misleading and reprehensible words and suffer themselves to be deprived of the ocean of verses revealed by God. If these obstructing veils had not intervened Persia would, in some two years, have been subdued through the power of utterance, the position of both the government and the people would have been raised and the Supreme Goal, unveiled and unconcealed, would have appeared in the plenitude of glory. In short, sometimes in explicit language, at other times by allusion, We said whatever had to be said. Thus, once Persia had been rehabilitated, the sweet savours of the Word of God would have wafted over all countries, inasmuch as that which hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen is conducive to the glory, the advancement and education of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Indeed it is the sovereign remedy for every disease, could they but comprehend and perceive it. Recently the Afnans and Amin - upon them be My glory and loving kindness - attained Our presence and beheld Our countenance; likewise Nabil, the son of Nabil and the son of Samandar - upon them rest the glory of God and His loving kindness - are present and have drunk the cup of reunion. We entreat God that He may graciously ordain for them the good of this world and of the next and that the outpouring of His blessing and grace may descend upon them from the heaven of His generosity and the clouds of His tender compassion. Verily of those who show mercy He is the Most Merciful, and He is the Gracious, the Beneficent. O Haydar ’Ali! Thine other letter which thou hadst forwarded through him who beareth the title of Jud (Bounty) hath reached Our holy court. Praised be God! It was adorned with the light of divine unity and of detachment and was ablaze with the fire of love and affection. Pray thou unto God that He may grant keenness to the eyes and illumine them with a new light, perchance they may perceive that which hath no parallel nor peer. In this day the verses of the Mother Book are resplendent […]</p>
<p>and unmistakable even as the sun. They can in no wise be mistaken for any of the past or more recent utterances. Truly this Wronged One desireth not to demonstrate His Own Cause with proofs produced by others. He is the One Who embraceth all things, while all else besides Him is circumscribed. Say, O people, peruse that which is current amongst you and We will peruse what pertaineth unto Us. I swear by God! Neither the praise of the peoples of the world, nor the things that the kindreds of the earth possess are worthy of mention before the remembrance of His Name. Unto this beareth witness He Who under all conditions proclaimeth, ‘Verily He is God, the sovereign Ruler of the Day of Reckoning and the Lord of the mighty Throne.’</p>
<p>Glorified be God! One wondereth by what proof or reason the disbelievers among the people of the Bayan have turned away from the Lord of being. In truth the station of this Revelation transcendeth the station of whatever hath been manifested in the past or will be made manifest in the future. Were the Point of the Bayan present in this day and should He, God forbid, hesitate to acknowledge this Cause, then the very blessed words which have streamed forth from the wellspring of His Own Bayan would apply to Him. He saith, and His word is the truth, ‘Lawful is it for Him Whom God will make manifest to reject him who is the greatest on earth.’ Say, O ye that are bereft of understanding! Today that Most Exalted Being is proclaiming: ‘Verily, verily, I am the first to adore Him.’ How shallow is the fund of men’s knowledge and how feeble their power of perception. Our Pen of Glory beareth witness to their abject poverty and to the wealth of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Lauded and glorified is He Who hath called the creation into being. He is the sovereign Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The Mother Book is revealed and the Lord of Bounty is established upon the most blessed seat of glory. The Dawn hath broken, yet the people understand not. The signs have been ushered in, while He Who hath revealed them is overwhelmed with manifest sorrow. Indeed I have endured that which hath caused the world of existence to lament.</p>
<p>Say: O Yahya (Azal), produce a single verse, if thou dost possess divinely-inspired knowledge. These words were formerly spoken by My Herald Who at this hour proclaimeth: ‘Verily, verily, I am the first to adore Him.’ Be fair, O My brother. Art thou able to express thyself when brought face to face with the billowing ocean of Mine utterance? Canst thou unloose thy tongue when confronted with the shrill voice of My Pen? Hast thou any power […]</p>
<p>Before the revelations of Mine omnipotence? Judge thou fairly, I adjure thee by God, and call to mind when thou didst stand in the presence of this Wronged One and We dictated to thee the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest the source of falsehood withhold thee from the manifest Truth. O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon My countenance! Say: O ye heedless ones! By reason of a droplet ye have deprived yourselves of the ocean of heavenly verses and for the sake of an insignificant atom ye have shut yourselves out from the splendours of the Day-Star of Truth. Who else but Baha hath the power to speak forth before the face of mankind? Judge ye fairly and be not of the unjust. Through Him the oceans have surged, the mysteries have been divulged and the trees have lifted up their voices exclaiming: The kingdoms of earth and heaven are God’s, the Revealer of signs, the Fountainhead of clear tokens. Peruse ye the Persian Bayan revealed by Him Who heralded this Revelation and look at it with the eye of fairness. Verily He will guide you aright to His Path. At this moment He proclaimeth that which His tongue had formerly uttered when He was seated upon the throne of His most exalted Name.</p>
<p>Thou hast made mention of the loved ones in those regions. Praised be God, each one of them attained the honour of being remembered by the True One - exalted is His glory - and the names of them, one and all, flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur in the kingdom of utterance. Great indeed is their blessedness and happiness, inasmuch as they have drunk the choice wine of revelation and inspiration from the hand of their Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful. We beseech God to strengthen them to manifest inflexible constancy and to summon to their aid the hosts of wisdom and utterance. He is in truth the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Convey my greetings to them and give them the joyful tidings that the Day-Star of remembrance hath dawned and shed its radiance from above the horizon of the bountiful favours of their Lord, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>Thou hast mentioned Husayn. We have attired his temple with the robe of forgiveness and adorned his head with the crown of pardon. It beseemeth him to pride himself among all men upon this resplendent, this radiant and manifest bounty. Say: Be not despondent. After the revelation of this blessed verse it is as though thou hast been born anew from thy mother’s womb. Say: Thou art free from sin and error. Truly God hath purged thee with the living waters of His utterance in His Most Great Prison. We entreat Him - blessed and exalted is He - to graciously confirm thee in extolling Him and in magnifying His glory.</p>
<p>exultation and delight. O people of Tar! Through the strengthening grace of God bestowed by this Revelation, ye are indeed endowed with wisdom and understanding. Therefore ye must direct your minds and your hearts to the Dawning-Place of these resplendent favors wherein lieth hidden that which no tongue can utter. Let not your understanding be confined within the bounds of human conventions and customs, for We have exalted this Day far above the comprehensions of mankind. None shall attain unto these heights save through complete detachment from all things earthly and through sincere adherence to whatsoever hath been revealed by the All-Merciful. This is that whereby ye shall be aided to reach a station wherein ye shall behold with your own eyes the effulgence of His light and hearken with your own ears unto the sweet melodies of His divine wisdom. The people of Baha must be like unto the letters and words that have been revealed in this Day - outwardly they appear limited and finite, yet within them are enshrined infinite meanings and unlimited mysteries. May the mercy of God assist ye to recognize in this Revelation that which eyeth have failed to perceive and whereunto ascendeth the Paradise of all names. Let your hearts be filled with gladness, but be not exultant in pride, for exultation in self leadeth to vainglory and pride. Let your joy be the joy of those who have recognized this truth - that all glory belongeth unto God and that His servants can lay claim to nothing save through His grace and bounty. Implore ye the one true God to grant that ye may taste the sweetness of His remembrance and praise. This is that which profiteth you both in this world and in the next.</p>
<p>delight and to deliver himself from the fire of remoteness. O people of Tar! Through the strengthening power of My Name seize ye the chalice of knowledge, drink then your fill in defiance of the people of the world who have broken the Covenant of God and His Testament, rejected His proofs and clear tokens, and cavilled at His signs which have pervaded all that are in heaven and on earth. The disbelievers among the people of the Bayan are like the followers of the Shi’ih sect and walk in their footsteps. Leave them to their idle fancies and vain imaginings. They are in truth accounted with the lost in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>The Shi’ih divines, one and all, are now engaged in reviling and denouncing the True One from their pulpits. Gracious God! Dawlat-Abadi too hath followed suit. He ascended the pulpit and gave voice to that which hath caused the Tablet to cry out in anguish and the Pen to wail. Meditate upon his conduct and the conduct of Ashraf - upon him be My glory and My tender mercy - and likewise consider those loved ones who hastened to the place of martyrdom in My Name, and offered up their lives in the path of Him Who is the Desire of the world.</p>
<p>The Cause is manifest, it shineth resplendent as the sun, but the people have become veils unto themselves. We entreat God that He may graciously assist them to return unto Him. He is, in truth, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O people of Tar! We send you greetings from this Spot and beseech God - blessed and exalted is He - to give you to drink the choice wine of constancy from the hand of His favour. Verily, He is the Lord of Bounty, the Gracious, the All-Praised. Leave ye unto themselves the immature ones of the world - they that are moved by selfish desire and cling to the exponents of idle fancy. Verily He is your Helper and Succourer. He is, in truth, potent to do whatsoever He willeth. No God is there but Him, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Most Great.</p>
<p>May glory from Our presence rest upon those who have set their faces toward the Dayspring of His Revelation and have acknowledged and recognized that which the Tongue of utterance hath spoken in the kingdom of knowledge in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable Day.</p>
<p>=== END BH00111 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00112 ===</p>
<p>In the name of the One Beloved One</p>
<p>The fragrance of sorrows hath encompassed the Beauty of the All-Merciful, and the gates of joy and gladness have been shut by reason of the tyranny of the rebellious among the people of the Bayan. Fie upon them! It is most certain, evident and proven that every previous Manifestation hath given glad tidings of the subsequent Revelation according to the stations and capacities of the people - some through allusion and some through subtle intimations. But the previous Manifestation, beyond what can be conceived and comprehended, strove in counseling and educating the people of the Bayan. Yet that which came to pass came to pass. We make mention of but one word, and We ask fairness of the people of the Bayan: Is it recorded in any passage of the divine Books that at the time of the subsequent Manifestation ye should tarry in accepting His Cause? Say: Produce it, if ye be truthful, nay, by my Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed! Furthermore, is it recorded in any passage of the Bayan that if someone should appear with verses ye should deny him or arise to slay him? And should anyone entertain doubts concerning these verses, such doubts would be identical to those raised by the exponents of perdition at the time of the appearance of the Manifestations of the Cause. I swear by the Sun of inner meanings that if the newly-revealed verses are denied, none would be able to establish the validity of previous verses. And since the Point of the Bayan - may the souls of all else be sacrificed for His sake - was anticipating these days and what His servants would perpetrate, naught but firm counsels, sound admonitions and goodly exhortations concerning this Revelation flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. The Book of Names was revealed - consider what was its purpose. He specifically named it the Book of Names, and in those tablets He made mention of all names, one after another, and interpreted them, and then counseled the Manifestations of Names to turn to the Creator of Names.</p>
<p>O heart of the world! Hast thou an ear to hear what the Dove of Sorrows warbleth in this time wherein the cry of Satan hath been raised after the call of the All-Merciful? For We find the people of the Bayan in heedlessness and manifest loss. By His beloved Self! None hath yet understood why divine books of every kind were revealed, particularly the Book of Names. Thus doth the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, inform you. But where are the pure ears that might hearken to the call that is raised at every moment from the direction of the Divine Unity? And where are the penetrating eyes that might perceive the lights of divine wisdom shining from these luminous words? The Self-Subsisting hath appeared with a manifest countenance, and He is the Beauty of the Nine promised unto all. Nevertheless, the fetid odors of jealousy and hatred have so seized upon the wilderness that they are utterly fleeing from the divine fragrances and holy breezes. Say: O people! Follow not those against whom the word of punishment hath been fulfilled, from whose faces appeareth the wrath of God, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. It is not known what they would have done had the Most Exalted Pen not moved with these counsels and exhortations. Nay, by Him Who hath made me independent of the worlds through what He hath graciously bestowed upon me, beyond what they have done and intend there was and is nothing possible. Strange it is that they recite the verses of God - by God, their Revealer curseth them and they perceive it not. The Beloved of all possibility, along with His firm and sound counsels, foretold what they would do, as hath come to pass.</p>
<p>The Beloved of all possibility, with firm and established counsels, hath foretold what they would do, as hath become manifest and shall yet be seen. Though no regard was shown them for the sake of God’s Cause, they have displayed sincerity and servitude, while undermining His Cause and calling people unto themselves in all regions - one deed in secret, another in the open. Some justice is needed. This servant hath shown no enmity to anyone. It is most clear that whenever regard was withheld, it was for God’s Cause, to manifest His sovereignty and exalt His Word. Whoever harbored rancor on this account was shown servitude, to the detriment of God’s Cause and in rebellion against it. Not one of God’s loved ones, purely for His sake, hath forbidden the idolaters from these abhorrent deeds. Hath no trace of divine fire remained in the hearts of men? Have the lights of the lamp of oneness not shone upon the hearts of creation? What hath happened that these temples have not been ignited by this fire, nor illumined by these lights? Say: O caravans of the cities of mystical knowledge! The true dawn hath risen from the horizon of the heaven of God’s holy will. Make haste that ye may join the hosts of those near unto God. Assuredly, the lighter your movement the better. Cast off the burden of perverse allusions and turn toward the realm of divine unity. The Most Exalted Pen declareth: Do ye not hear My lamentation and sighing, or do ye hear but comprehend not? If ye cannot soar in the atmospheres of inner meanings, then soar in the atmosphere of words. If ye cannot comprehend the wondrous Arabic verses of this Revelation, reflect upon the Persian Bayan which I revealed aforetime and the Persian words revealed in this Manifestation, that ye may find a way to the truth. By Him Who hath kindled the fire of His love in my heart in such wise that the waters of the opposition of all the worlds cannot quench it! The Primal Point had no purpose save this Manifestation - may my spirit be sacrificed for His Being. He did not fall short in proclaiming My Cause, but the people are neglectful and remiss. Whosoever for one hour detacheth himself, for the sake of God, from veils and allusions, and pondereth what hath been revealed from God’s Kingdom in Arabic and Persian, by God, he will cut himself from the worlds and lament for this wronged, imprisoned Stranger. Solid rocks wail at God’s Word, yet mankind remaineth in grievous heedlessness. This is why it was revealed aforetime in God’s Books that rivers flow from rocks, yet no trace appeareth from the hearts of the wicked. God, the Exalted, the Great, hath spoken true. Know, O questioner, that God’s Word comprehendeth all meanings - that is, all divine meanings and mysteries lie hidden within it. Blessed is he who attaineth unto it and bringeth forth the hidden pearls thereof. Consider the dawning of God’s Word like unto the dawning of the sun. Just as the sun, after its rising, shineth upon all things, in the same way doth the Sun of the Word, which hath dawned from the horizon of divine will, shed its radiance upon all. I seek God’s forgiveness for this comparison, for the visible sun deriveth from the all-embracing Word. Ponder that thou mayest know. However, the shining of the visible sun is perceived by the outward eye[…]</p>
<p>Consider the effulgence of the Divine Word to be like unto the effulgence of the sun. Just as the sun, after its rising, sheds its radiance upon all things, in like manner doth the Sun of the Word, which hath shone forth from the horizon of the divine Will, cast its rays upon all beings. God forbid such a comparison, for the visible sun itself deriveth its light from the all-encompassing Word. Ponder this, that thou mayest understand. However, the radiance of the visible sun is perceived by the outward eye, while the effulgence of the Sun of the Word is discerned by the inner eye. By Him Who holdeth my soul in His hand! Were the inner power and sustaining force of the Divine Word to be withdrawn for but a moment from the world and its peoples, all would cease to exist and pass into nothingness. Should one gaze with divine vision, he would witness its effulgence and splendors in all things; likewise, should one hearken with pure ears, he would hear at all times the primal Call of God. The divine Call is forever raised, yet ears are shut out; the light and splendors of the Day-Star of the horizons are manifest, yet eyes remain veiled.</p>
<p>O discerning physician! A physician is needed who may, through the Greatest Elixir, heal the affliction of the eyes and transmute the copper of existence into gold. Would that the realm of the knowledge of the Best-Beloved of the worlds might be expanded through the existence of the mature ones, that from the manifest letters of the Word infinite knowledge might appear and be detailed! An ailment hath afflicted the people which is most difficult to cure, save for those who seek healing from the Most Great Antidote. And it is this: that every soul who hath inhaled, by his own fancy, a whiff of knowledge, hath imagined the Truth to be like unto himself, and most are afflicted with this malady today. This hath caused them to remain deprived of the Truth and what lieth with Him. Beseech ye God to purify the hearts and sharpen the vision, that perchance they may know themselves, distinguish the Truth from all else, and comprehend the divine purpose in the revealed verses. Had the peoples attained unto the divine purpose, they would not have remained veiled at the time of His manifestation. Although they recited the divine Book for years, they failed to grasp a single letter of its meaning, being utterly veiled and heedless of its purpose, though all was recorded and inscribed in God’s Book. All were deprived to such extent that even some matters known to the common people were unknown to those who counted themselves among the elect - such as the presence of the Qa’im in the well-known city. So firm were they in this belief that they condemned to death anyone who suggested that His Holiness would be born. Consider how remote and deprived the learned ones were, until in the year sixty the veil was rent asunder and all that was hidden became manifest. Likewise concerning the Resurrection and all pertaining to it - none had attained to a drop from the ocean of these utterances in God’s Book, all having mistaken the mirage for water, as was witnessed. Beyond these matters, they remained veiled from the very knowledge of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and the dust of fancy and the clay of conjecture prevented all creation from the divine presence, until the Most Great Purifier came and bathed the people in the most pure Kawthar, inviting them to the most luminous horizon and giving them glad tidings. Now observe what was revealed were excellences of which all were heedless. And if it be said that all was concealed and treasured in God’s Book, and that in the manifestation of the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all existence be sacrificed for Him - the veiled meanings in the divine words emerged from behind the veil in the chambers of utterance, this is the truth in which there is no doubt. And if it be said that what was mentioned before in summary came to be explained and detailed, this is the truth in which there is no doubt. And if it be said that what appeared in this wondrous Revelation had no precedent and all is new, this saying too is correct and complete. For if God, exalted be His mention, should today utter a word that all people past and future have uttered and will utter, that word would be new, were ye to reflect. Consider the word of unity, which the Manifestations of Truth have uttered in every Revelation […]</p>
<p>Consider the word of Divine Unity, for in every Dispensation the Manifestations of Truth have voiced it and all peoples of diverse faiths have uttered this goodly word. Yet in each Revelation it hath been renewed, and never hath its quality of innovation been taken from it. When God uttereth a word, a fresh spirit is breathed into that word, and the breezes of life from that word waft over all things, both outwardly and inwardly. None can tell for how long the effects of God’s word, as manifested in the horizons without and within, shall endure.</p>
<p>That some people should speak of certain imaginary concepts and take pride and glory in them is wholly rejected and unmentionable in God’s sight, for true glory lies in recognizing God and in steadfastness and firmness in His Cause, not in outward utterances. As the previous Manifestation hath stated these truths, observe ye that ye may understand. For instance, those who have ascended to the pinnacle of recognition and those who remain at the lowest level are accounted as one in God’s presence, for the nobility of knowledge and wisdom lies not in knowledge itself but in whether it leads to recognition of God and acceptance of Him. Otherwise it is rejected. All words in that realm are mentioned in the same degree - for example, if one were to say “begotten” it would be as His saying “neither begetteth nor is begotten.”</p>
<p>Although outwardly the divine abstraction from all likeness and peer represents the highest stage of human understanding - as this station is indeed considered most lofty among people - yet even this distinction depends on God’s acceptance and is realized through His will. Thus in the Dispensation of the Qur’an and the Bayan, the divine Will was attached to pure abstraction and absolute sanctification. Therefore the effects of these utterances became fixed and manifest in the hearts of the servants. Otherwise, that Ancient Beauty is sanctified above all such contingent words and that most holy Court is exalted above all such expressions. One must look to the root of God’s Cause, not to the high or low stations of verbal recognition established among creatures.</p>
<p>Would that I could reveal what is hidden! Yet incapacity stems from the veiling of souls, for verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. At one time He said “Thou shalt not see Me” and at another time He said “Look and thou shalt see Me.” In brief, today whosoever accepteth that which hath been sent down from the heaven of God’s Will hath attained the ultimate pinnacle of recognition, and without this he is deprived and as nothing. We beseech God to assist us and you to be steadfast in this Cause, through which the kingdom of names was revolutionized and the inhabitants of the cities of creation were intoxicated, save those whom guidance preceded from God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O thou who art turned towards Me! Ponder well on that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, that the gates of infinite knowledge may be opened before thy heart’s countenance, and thou mayest find thyself independent of all save God. Think not that the Revelation of Truth is confined to the manifestation of outward knowledge and the alteration of established laws among mankind. Rather, at the time of its appearance, all things become the bearers of boundless grace and capacities, and these shall be revealed according to the requirements of time and earthly means. In this connection, a brief response was sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s will to one of the Christian priests dwelling in the great city, and here we mention some of it, that perchance certain servants may become aware of some of God’s consummate wisdom that is hidden from sight. His exalted Word declares: “Thy letter hath been presented in the Kingdom of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and We have taken it with fragrance and spirit, and have answered thee before thy question. Reflect that thou mayest know, and this is from the grace of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this, though it be veiled. It shall be unveiled unto thee when God willeth and desireth, and thou shalt behold what no eye hath seen.”</p>
<p>O thou who art immersed in the sea of divine knowledge and who gazeth toward thy Lord, the All-Merciful! Know thou that this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. Consider, then remember him who was named Peter in the Kingdom of God. Verily, despite his exalted station, his sublime rank and his lofty position, his feet nearly slipped from the straight path. But the hand of grace seized him and preserved him from error, and made him to be of those endued with certitude. If thou wert to recognize this melody wherewith the Dove coothed upon the branches of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, thou wouldst surely be convinced that what was mentioned aforetime hath been fulfilled in truth. Then shall one feast in the Kingdom of God upon eternal and everlasting bounty, and drink from the Kawthar of realities and the Salsabil of inner meanings. But the people are veiled by a mighty veil. Verily, those who heard this call and remained heedless thereof - it would have been better for them had they not existed than to hesitate in this Cause. Yet that which was to appear hath appeared, and the matter hath been decided by God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Say: O people! The Spirit hath come again to fulfill for you what He said before. Thus were ye promised in the Tablets, did ye but know. Verily, He sayeth as He said, and He sacrificed His spirit as He sacrificed it the first time, out of love for those who are in the heavens and on earth. Know thou that when the Son yielded up His spirit, all things wept, but through His sacrifice of spirit all things were made ready, as thou dost witness and behold in all creation. From every wise one wisdom was manifested, from every learned one knowledge was detailed, from every craftsman crafts appeared, and from every sovereign power was revealed - all through the confirmation of His transcendent, all-pervading, luminous spirit.</p>
<p>We testify that when He came into the world, He shed His radiance upon all created things. Through Him every leper was cleansed from the disease of ignorance and blindness, every sick one was healed from the malady of heedlessness and desire, the eyes of every blind one were opened, and every soul was purified by One mighty and powerful. In one sense, leprosy referreth to whatsoever veils the servant from the recognition of his Lord, and he who is veiled is indeed a leper and shall not be mentioned in the Kingdom of God, the Mighty, the Praised. We testify that through the Word of God every leper was purified, every afflicted one was healed, and every sick one was cured. Verily it is the Purifier of the world. Blessed is he who hath turned unto it with a luminous countenance.</p>
<p>Know thou that He Who ascended to heaven hath in truth descended, and through Him the breezes of grace wafted over the world - and thy Lord is witness to what I say. The world was perfumed by His return and His appearance, but those who are occupied with the world and its ornaments perceive not the fragrance of the garment, and We find them in grievous error. Say: The Bell peals with His Name and the Trumpet with His mention, and He Himself testifies to His own Self. Blessed are they that know. But today the leper is cleansed before being told “Be thou pure,” and through His manifestation the world and its people have been healed of every disease and sickness. Exalted be this grace that no grace hath preceded it, and exalted be this mercy that hath embraced all the worlds.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned in the Kingdom of God! Rise up by the power of thy Lord and say: O people of the earth! He Who is the Quickener of the world hath come, and He Who kindleth the fire in the heart of the world hath appeared. The Herald hath called out in the holy wilderness in the name of Ali-before-Nabil, and hath announced unto the people the meeting with God in the Most Glorious Paradise, whose gate hath been opened through grace unto the faces of those who have turned towards Him. That which was inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Kingdom of God, the Lord of the first and the last, hath been fulfilled, and he that willeth may partake thereof, for verily it is a wondrous sustenance. Say: The Most Great Bell hath appeared, and the hand of the Divine Will ringeth it in the Paradise of Oneness. Hearken, O people, and be not of the heedless ones.</p>
<p>God willing, souls shall appear who will comprehend the purpose of God, exalted be His glory, from these utterances, and who will strive with the utmost submissiveness and humility to protect and safeguard His Cause from the rejected polytheistic souls. Verily, He hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Whosoever hath been blessed with a drop from the Kawthar of utterance perceiveth that in the Manifestation of the Point of the Bayan there appeared that which had been hidden from eternity, and this Manifestation and the previous one are identical to the appearance of John the son of Zacharias and the Spirit. This hath been mentioned in some of the revealed Tablets - consider ye this.</p>
<p>This is that Manifestation Who hath come for the capacity of the people of the world. The time of the passing away of the world and its people hath arrived. He Who was eternal hath come to bestow eternal life, to make enduring, and to grant the essence of life. That which was revealed in the Bayan hath been fulfilled. This is that promised Beauty Who said, “He Who cometh after Me is before Me.” His was that call raised between heaven and earth saying “Make straight the divine stations” - meaning the hearts - and it was the same call that John the son of Zacharias made before the Spirit, saying “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord.”</p>
<p>Better would it be for a viper to be born of its mother than for a human to be born and become known for opposition in the Divine Kingdom. Blessed are the barren; woe unto those who nurse! Say: The Supreme Pen declareth: O ye who are lost in the wilderness of passion! Ye reject Me while claiming to accept him who spoke in My remembrance. Ye speak falsely, O people of darkness who flee from the resplendent morn! Were ye to draw nigh, assuredly your rejected deeds of self would be exposed in the light. Woe unto those souls who are heedless of these days and their fruit! Soon shall they lament for themselves and find none to console them. Blessed are the truthful ones who have attained unto manifest truth. Blessed are the knowing ones who have recognized the straight path of God and turned unto His Kingdom. Blessed are the joyous and sincere ones whose heart-lamps are lit with the oil of the recognition of the All-Merciful and are protected by the glass of detachment from the blowing of the winds of sorrow and trial. Well is it with the stout-hearted whose hearts have not been weakened by the oppression of the tyrants, and well is it with the seeing ones who have fixed their gaze upon eternity […]</p>
<p>How blessed is the state of them that are endowed with vision, who have become fully aware of both permanence and evanescence, have turned their faces toward that which endureth forever, and are remembered among the people of eternity in the most exalted heaven. Their hearts shall surely not weaken, for they are possessed of insight. Say: O servants! In either case ye shall be slain and sacrificed, whether by the swords of illness or by the swords of the heedless. This being so, if ye should be put to death by the swords of the idolaters in the path of the Best-Beloved of the worlds, this would be more beloved and befitting, for the blood-money is the Beloved Himself. Forget not this precious fruit, nor let it slip from your grasp. How blessed is the state of the righteous, from whose deeds the sweet fragrance of divine acceptance is wafted abroad. How wretched is the state of the tale-bearers, the mischief-makers, and the oppressors, even should they appear among men with wealth and glory. Erelong shall sudden abasement and endless wrath lay hold upon such souls. The Word that was formerly revealed hath at all times appeared with a wondrous spirit from the horizon of the mouth of the Will of the All-Merciful - that Word which I addressed to the Son, meaning the Spirit, saying: Moses came for religion and ritual, and the son of Zachariah for baptism, but I am come to give everlasting life and to bring them into the eternal Kingdom. Say: O friends! Thieves and traitors lie in wait in their ambush. O bearers of the trust of the All-Merciful! Be not heedless, but guard the pearls of divine love from the robbers. I swear by the Day-Star of the horizon of inner meanings that whoso faileth in this Day to rend asunder the veils of idle fancies shall not hear the divine call. Well is it with such souls as have shattered the idols of vain imaginings through the power of God and, having heard the call of the All-Merciful, have risen from among the dead. Upon them be wafted the sweet savors of God, the Lord of names and attributes.</p>
<p>O people of the earth! The call of the All-Merciful hath been raised between earth and heaven, and the heart of the world hath been set ablaze by the hearing of the divine Word, and yet the cold-hearted remain in the graves of heedlessness and oblivion. They have not felt its warmth, much less its flame. They shall abide forever in their graves. Arise, O people, to the aid of God! The Self-Subsisting hath come unto you - He of Whom the Qa’im gave you tidings. Through Him the Most Great Convulsion and the Supreme Ordeal have appeared. The sincere rejoice at His manifestation, while the idolaters are consumed by the fire of malice. Say: I adjure you by God, O people of the Bayan, to be fair in but one word: your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath not made this Cause dependent upon anything that hath been created in all existence, even as was revealed in the Bayan - yet ye have done to His Beloved what ye have done. Had this Revelation been made contingent upon aught beside Him, ye would not have perpetrated such acts, O company of oppressors! Is there any that hath a hearing ear or penetrating vision, that he might hear and perceive? Say: The Eye of God weepeth, while ye sport and play. O ye at whom the Concourse on high stand bewildered because of your deeds!</p>
<p>O My friends! Ye are the fountains of My utterance. From each of you floweth a drop from the river of divine meaning. With the arm of certitude cleanse these fountains from the debris of doubts and vain imaginings, that from you may appear firm and conclusive answers to questions such as these. In this Most Great Revelation, all must become manifest in sciences and wisdom, for all creatures, nay all things, have in these days that admit of no doubt received, each according to its capacity, the outpourings of divine grace through the breathing of the divine breezes. Within the depths of the revealed Words lieth the answer to both the mentioned questions and the hidden mysteries. God willing, gaze upon His words with divine vision that ye may understand what was intended. This very question was asked of the Spirit, concerning the son of Zachariah who came and called the people to truth and performed the baptism. What was the purpose of his appearance, and what did He say concerning this Revelation? He came to bear witness unto Me and fulfilled that whereunto he was commanded, and I came to set ablaze the peoples of the world […]</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Most Great Scene! Sorrows have reached such a degree that the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath been silenced from utterance. By God! Mine eye weepeth, and My tongue moveth, and My pen writeth that which floweth therefrom, as witnessed by him who standeth before My face. For the people of the Bayan have become so veiled that were they to witness today from anyone that which is contrary to what the Ancient and Eternal Truth, glorified be His majesty, hath ever commanded, they would accept it. For instance, the chief of prevaricators hath written that verses were a proof at the beginning of the Manifestation but are no longer so. Say: O people of the Bayan! Be fair, by God, your Lord, the All-Merciful! Setting aside this divine Servant and the manifestations of eternal glory revealed in this Revelation, consider ye the entire Bayan and judge for yourselves. You who were not content with the judgment of Truth and what was sent down from His presence - yet Truth, if justice be observed, is content with your judgment, that perchance an eye might open in fairness and turn toward God. It is most evident that the entire Bayan, explicitly and without interpretation, opposeth this statement that turneth away from God. Nevertheless, with such audacity and without concealment they have opposed and continue to oppose the entire Bayan while considering themselves its champions. By God! The Bayan lamenteth because of them and curseth them. Now, for the sake of God, reflect a little: what is the cause of their striving with such audacity to violate the sanctity of God’s Book? This is most obvious and clear that the cause is the acceptance of some among the people of the Bayan. Otherwise, by Him Who made Me speak with truth and manifested Me to establish His Cause, were they not confident, they would never show such audacity. This is among the most great wisdom of God revealed in the Bayan, such that not a line is inscribed therein except that it mentioneth, whether allusively or explicitly, that ye should not hesitate at the next Manifestation and should seek naught but verses. Nevertheless, they have denied and committed such momentous acts as ye all know, and none hath objected. Yet they have attributed to this Focal Point, by Whose will all books speak, that He hath abrogated the laws of the Bayan. The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! This, despite the fact that by the explicit text of the Bayan, this Manifestation was and shall be the Chosen One, and the entire Bayan speaketh in His praise and herald His appearance, and whatsoever appeareth from Him is that which appeared from the previous Manifestation, and whosoever maketh a distinction is a polytheist and a liar, a doubting denier. And regarding the verses of the past, most of the followers of religions have witnessed supernatural occurrences from the Most Holy Court in such wise as cannot be described in words. Ask the city and those around it that the truth may become evident to you. It is not known what that objecting soul claimeth for himself. Nay, by the Self of Baha, he is but in grievous error. Beseech ye God to grant you the grace to succeed, that ye may remain steadfast upon the path of the Cause, for this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed. Soon shall its greatness become clear and evident. None shall endure save those who gaze upon the Most Great Scene and are detached from all who are in the heavens and on earth for love of God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Today is the Day to render victorious the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon every soul to summon the people to the divine realm with the utmost steadfastness. Make ye a mighty effort, so that perchance those who have strayed in the wilderness of self and passion may turn their faces toward the most holy and glorious horizon. From souls will come forth effects that are and ever shall be cherished, for the fruit of every soul is its effect. A soul without effect is, in the Most Sublime Vision, accounted as a tree without fruit. Speak ye for the sake of God and teach His Cause for His sake. Look not to rejection or acceptance, but rather to the service whereunto ye have been bidden by God. This is the most great favor, eternal success, everlasting fruit, and the bestowal of Truth at all times, and His outpouring grace hath reached and shall continue to reach in every season. Whoso is His, verily He is with him and will aid him with truth, and He, verily, hath power over all things. And the Glory be upon you, O My loved ones, with the everlastingness of My Kingdom and the permanence of My Dominion.</p>

<p>O SON OF GLORY!</p>
<p>Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the heaven of communion with Me. Cleanse thy heart with the burnish of the spirit, and hasten to the court of the Most High. 9. O FLEETING SHADOW! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to the exalted heights of certainty. Open the eye of truth, that thou mayest behold the veilless Beauty and exclaim: Hallowed be the Lord, the most excellent of all creators! 10. O SON OF DESIRE! Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye recognize the everlasting Beauty, nor the lifeless heart delight in aught but in the withered bloom. For like seeketh like, and taketh pleasure in the company of its kind. 11. O SON OF DUST! Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet melody of My voice; empty thyself of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou mayest obtain a lasting share from the ocean of My eternal wealth. Blind thine eyes, that is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My word; empty thyself of all learning save the knowledge of Me; that with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest enter the court of My holiness. 12. O MAN OF TWO VISIONS! Close one eye and open the other. Close one to the world and all that is therein, and open the other to the hallowed beauty of the Beloved. […]</p>
<p>O COMRADES!</p>
<p>The gates of the measureless realm have been opened wide, and He Who is the Morning Star of truth is pouring out the radiance of light, yet ye remain immersed in utter darkness. The celestial table is descended from the heaven of divine bounty, yet not a soul hath tasted of its holy sustenance. The spring of life eternal hath been made manifest by the Mystic Dove, yet no one hath attained its crystal streams. […]</p>
<p>[Note: This appears to be an extract from The Hidden Words of Baha’u’llah, including Hidden Word #17 of the Persian section and its continuation. I’ve provided the remaining portion of Hidden Word #17 in the style of Shoghi Effendi’s translation.]</p>
<p>The gates that open on the Placeless stand wide and the habitation of the loved one is adorned with the lovers’ blood, yet all but a few remain bereft of this celestial city, and even of these few, none but the smallest handful hath been found with a pure heart and sanctified spirit.</p>
<p>18. O YE DWELLERS IN THE HIGHEST PARADISE!</p>
<p>Proclaim unto the children of assurance that within the realms of holiness, nigh unto the celestial paradise, a new garden hath appeared, round which circle the denizens of the realm on high and the immortal dwellers of the exalted paradise. Strive, then, that ye may attain that station, that ye may unravel the mysteries of love from its wind-flowers and learn the secret of divine and consummate wisdom from its eternal fruits. Solaced are the eyes of them that enter and abide therein!</p>
<p>19. O MY FRIENDS!</p>
<p>Have ye forgotten that true and radiant morn, when in those hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree of life, which is planted in the all-glorious paradise? Awe-struck ye listened as I gave utterance to these three most holy words: O friends! Prefer not your will to Mine, never desire that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts, defiled with worldly desires and cravings. Would ye but sanctify your souls, ye would at this present hour recall that place and those surroundings, and the truth of My utterance should be made evident unto all of you. In the eighth of the most holy lines, in the fifth Tablet of Paradise, He saith:</p>
<p>20. O YE THAT ARE LYING AS DEAD ON THE COUCH OF HEEDLESSNESS!</p>
<p>Ages have passed and your precious lives are well-nigh ended, yet not a single breath of purity hath reached Our court of holiness from you. Though immersed in the ocean of misbelief, yet with your lips ye profess the one true faith of God. Him whom I abhor ye have loved, and of My foe ye have made a friend. Notwithstanding, ye walk on My earth complacent and self-satisfied, heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything within it shunneth you. Were ye but to open your eyes, ye would, in truth, prefer a myriad griefs unto this joy, and would count death itself better than this life.</p>
<p>21. O MOVING FORM OF DUST!</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I desire communion with thee, but thou wouldst put no trust in Me. The sword of thy rebellion hath felled the tree of thy hope. At all times I am near unto thee, but thou art ever far from Me. Imperishable glory I have chosen for thee, yet boundless shame thou hast chosen for thyself. While there is yet time, return, and lose not thy chance.</p>
<p>22. O SON OF DESIRE!</p>
<p>The learned and the wise have for long years striven and failed to attain the presence of the All-Glorious; they have spent their lives in search of Him, yet did not behold the beauty of His countenance. Thou without the least effort didst attain thy goal, and without search hast obtained the object of thy quest. Yet, notwithstanding, thou didst remain so wrapt in the veil of self, that thine eyes beheld not the beauty of the Beloved, nor did thy hand touch the hem of His robe. Ye that have eyes, behold and wonder.</p>
<p>23. O DWELLERS IN THE CITY OF LOVE!</p>
<p>Mortal blasts have beset the everlasting candle, and the beauty of the celestial Youth is veiled in the darkness of dust. The chief of the monarchs of love is wronged by the people of tyranny and the dove of holiness lies prisoned in the talons of owls. The dwellers in the pavilion of glory and the celestial concourse bewail and lament, while ye repose in the realm of negligence, and esteem yourselves as of the true friends. How vain are your imaginings!</p>
<p>24. O YE THAT ARE FOOLISH, YET HAVE A NAME TO BE WISE!</p>
<p>Wherefore do ye wear the guise of shepherds, when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent upon My flock? Ye are even as the star, which riseth ere the dawn, and which, though it seem radiant and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of My city astray into the paths of perdition.</p>
<p>25. O YE SEEMING FAIR YET INWARDLY FOUL!</p>
<p>Ye are like clear but bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by the divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sun beam falls alike upon the dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference!</p>
<p>26. O MY FRIEND IN WORD!</p>
<p>Ponder awhile. Hast thou ever heard that friend and foe should abide in one heart? Cast out then the stranger, that the Friend may enter His home.</p>
<p>27. O SON OF DUST!</p>
<p>All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained for thee, except the human heart, which I have made the habitation of My beauty and glory; yet thou didst give My home and dwelling to another than Me; and whenever the manifestation of My holiness sought His own abode, a stranger found He there, and, homeless, hastened unto the sanctuary of the Beloved. Notwithstanding I have concealed thy secret and desired not thy shame.</p>
<p>28. O ESSENCE OF DESIRE!</p>
<p>At many a dawn have I turned from the realms of the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned to the realms of celestial glory and breathed it not in My retreats above unto the hosts of holiness.</p>
<p>29. O SON OF BOUNTY!</p>
<p>Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My command I made thee to appear, and have ordained for thy training every atom in existence and the essence of all created things. Thus, ere thou didst issue from thy mother’s womb, I destined for thee two founts of gleaming milk, eyes to watch over thee, and hearts to love thee. Out of My loving-kindness, ’neath the shade of My mercy I nurtured thee, and guarded thee by the essence of My grace and favor. And My purpose in all this was that thou mightest attain My everlasting dominion and become worthy of My invisible bestowals. And yet heedless thou didst remain, and when fully grown, thou didst neglect all My bounties and occupied thyself with thine idle imaginings, in such wise that thou didst become wholly forgetful, and, turning away from the portals of the Friend didst abide within the courts of My enemy.</p>
<p>30. O BOND SLAVE OF THE WORLD!</p>
<p>Many a dawn hath the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing then thy plight it returned whence it came.</p>
<p>31. O SON OF EARTH!</p>
<p>Wouldst thou have Me, seek none other than Me; and wouldst thou gaze upon My beauty, close thine eyes to the world and all that is therein; for My will and the will of another than Me, even as fire and water, cannot dwell together in one heart.</p>
<p>32. O BEFRIENDED STRANGER!</p>
<p>The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of My power, quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion. The healer of all thine ills is remembrance of Me, forget it not. Make My love thy treasure and cherish it even as thy very sight and life.</p>
<p>33. O MY BROTHER!</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and loose thy soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will come to thee no more. 41. O SON OF MY HANDMAID! Didst thou behold immortal sovereignty, thou wouldst strive to pass from this fleeting world. But to conceal the one from thee and to reveal the other is a mystery which none but the pure in heart can comprehend. 42. O MY SERVANT! Purge thy heart from malice and, innocent of envy, enter the divine court of holiness. 43. O MY FRIENDS! Walk ye in the ways of the good pleasure of the Friend, and know that His pleasure is in the pleasure of His creatures. That is: no man should enter the house of his friend save at his friend’s pleasure, nor lay hands upon his treasures nor prefer his own will to his friend’s, and in no wise seek an advantage over him. Ponder this, ye that have insight! 44. O COMPANION OF MY THRONE! Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not thyself, neither sigh and weep. Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear it spoken unto thee, and magnify not the faults of others that thine own faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone, that thine own abasement be not exposed. Live then the days of thy life, that are less than a fleeting moment, with thy mind stainless, thy heart unsullied, thy thoughts pure, and thy nature sanctified, so that, free and content, thou mayest put away this mortal frame, and repair unto the mystic paradise and abide in the eternal kingdom for evermore.</p>
<p>O BRETHREN IN THE PATH!</p>
<p>Why do ye neglect the remembrance of the Beloved, and keep remote from His holy presence? The essence of beauty is within the peerless pavilion, seated on the throne of glory, whilst ye busy yourselves with idle contentions. The sweet savors of holiness are breathing and the breath of bounty is wafted, yet ye are all sorely afflicted and deprived thereof. Alas for you and for them that walk in your ways and follow in your footsteps!</p>
<p>Wherefore have ye neglected the mention of the Loved One, and kept remote from His holy presence? The essence of beauty is within the peerless pavilion, set upon the throne of glory, whilst ye busy yourselves with idle contentions. The sweet savors of holiness are breathing and the breath of bounty is wafted, yet ye are all sorely afflicted and deprived thereof. Alas for you and for them that walk in your ways and follow in your footsteps!</p>
<p>47. O CHILDREN OF DESIRE!</p>
<p>Put away the garment of vainglory, and divest yourselves of the attire of haughtiness. In the third of the most holy lines writ and recorded in the Ruby Tablet by the pen of the unseen this is revealed:</p>
<p>48. O BRETHREN!</p>
<p>Be forbearing one with another and set not your affections on things below. Pride not yourselves in your glory, and be not ashamed of abasement. By My beauty! I have created all things from dust, and to dust will I return them again.</p>
<p>49. O CHILDREN OF DUST!</p>
<p>Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor, lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them of the Tree of Wealth. To give and to be generous are attributes of Mine; well is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues.</p>
<p>50. O QUINTESSENCE OF PASSION!</p>
<p>Put away all covetousness and seek contentment; for the covetous hath ever been deprived, and the contented hath ever been loved and praised.</p>
<p>51. O SON OF MY HANDMAID!</p>
<p>Be not troubled in poverty nor confident in riches, for poverty is followed by riches, and riches are followed by poverty. Yet to be poor in all save God is a wondrous gift, belittle not the value thereof, for in the end it will make thee rich in God, and thus thou shalt know the meaning of the utterance, “In truth ye are the poor,” and the holy words, “God is the all-possessing,” shall even as the true morn break forth gloriously resplendent upon the horizon of the lover’s heart, and abide secure on the throne of wealth.</p>
<p>52. O CHILDREN OF NEGLIGENCE AND PASSION!</p>
<p>O HEEDLESS ONES!</p>
<p>Think not the secrets of hearts are hidden; nay, know ye of a certainty that in clear characters they are engraved and are openly manifest in the holy Presence. 60. O FRIENDS! Verily I say, whatsoever ye have concealed within your hearts is to Us open and manifest as the day; but that it is hidden is of Our grace and favor, and not of your deserving. 61. O SON OF MAN! A dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of My mercy I shed upon the peoples of the world, yet found none turn thereunto, inasmuch as every one hath turned away from the celestial wine of unity unto the foul dregs of impurity, and, content with mortal cup, hath put away the chalice of immortal beauty. Vile is that wherewith he is contented. 62. O SON OF DUST! Turn not away thine eyes from the matchless wine of the immortal Beloved, and open them not to foul and mortal dregs. Take from the hands of the divine Cup-bearer the chalice of immortal life, that all wisdom may be thine and that thou mayest hearken unto the mystic voice calling from the realm of the invisible. Cry aloud, ye that are of low aim! Wherefore have ye turned away from My holy and immortal wine unto evanescent water? 63. O YE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD! Know ye, verily, that an unforeseen calamity followeth you, and grievous retribution awaiteth you. Think not that which ye have committed hath been effaced in My sight. By My beauty! All your doings hath My pen graven with open characters upon tablets of chrysolite. 64. O OPPRESSORS ON EARTH! Withdraw your hands from tyranny, for I have pledged Myself not to forgive any man’s injustice. This is My covenant which I have irrevocably decreed in the preserved tablet and sealed with My seal.</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>Know ye that when the radiant morn breaketh forth above the horizon of eternity, the spiritual mysteries and secrets hidden in the knowledge of the divine Beings will become manifest and visible before the eyes of men.</p>
<p>[Note: The provided text includes Hidden Words #59-67, most of which were already in English, requiring only the completion of #67.]</p>
<p>For brief earthly sovereignty ye have abandoned My imperishable dominion, and have adorned yourselves with the gay livery of the world and made of it your boast. By My beauty! All will I gather beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and efface all these diverse colors save them that choose My own, and that is purging from every color.</p>

<p>Quaff from the tongue of the merciful the stream of divine mystery, and behold from the dayspring of divine utterance the unveiled splendor of the daystar of wisdom. Sow the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of the heart, and water them with the waters of certitude, that the hyacinths of knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green from the holy city of the heart.</p>
<p>79. O SON OF DESIRE!</p>
<p>How long wilt thou soar in the realms of desire? Wings have I bestowed upon thee, that thou mayest fly to the realms of mystic holiness and not the regions of satanic fancy. The comb, too, have I given thee that thou mayest dress My raven locks, and not lacerate My throat.</p>
<p>80. O MY SERVANTS!</p>
<p>Ye are the trees of My garden; ye must give forth goodly and wondrous fruits, that ye yourselves and others may profit therefrom. Thus it is incumbent on every one to engage in crafts and professions, for therein lies the secret of wealth, O men of understanding! For results depend upon means, and the grace of God shall be all-sufficient unto you. Trees that yield no fruit have been and will ever be for the fire.</p>
<p>81. O MY SERVANT!</p>
<p>The basest of men are they that yield no fruit on earth. Such men are verily counted as among the dead, nay better are the dead in the sight of God than those idle and worthless souls.</p>
<p>82. O MY SERVANT!</p>
<p>The best of men are they that earn a livelihood by their calling and spend upon themselves and upon their kindred for the love of God, the Lord of all worlds. The mystic and wondrous Bride, hidden ere this beneath the veiling of utterance, hath now, by the grace of God and His divine favor, been made manifest even as the resplendent light shed by the beauty of the Beloved. I bear witness, O friends! that the favor is complete, the argument fulfilled, the proof manifest and the evidence established. Let it now be seen what your endeavors in the path of detachment will reveal. In this wise hath the divine favor been fully vouchsafed unto you and unto them that are in heaven and on earth. All praise to God, the Lord of all Worlds.</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>All praise befitteth Him Who hath ever been, and will forever remain, sanctified from praise, and pure adoration belongeth unto the Lord of Names, to Whom all sincere ones, all them that are nigh, and all who profess His unity have testified that He was and is sanctified from the praise of all else but Him. When the ocean of loving-kindness was stirred into motion and the fragrance of grace was wafted abroad, through His pure bounty and generosity He gave permission for the praise of His sacred Being and granted leave for glorification of His most holy Essence. Therefore did tongues gain strength through the effulgent rays of the Sun of Permission and grow bold to make mention of Him - else how could utter nothingness manifest itself in the realm of existence, and absolute extinction set foot in the court of immortality? His grace upheld, and His bounty granted leave. His is the praise, His the thanks, His the mention, His the glorification. Verily, He is the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Long have grown the days of my rebellion, grave have become my transgressions, and multiplied my errors. I know not, O my God, whether it beseemeth my mention and my call, my praise and my glorification to be honored by Thy hearing, or whether they should return to my own limitations and abasement. When, despite my poverty and lowliness, I turn toward the horizon of grace, the wonders of Thy bounty embolden me; yet whenever I consider my state and worth, despair seizeth me from every direction. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world and Creator of the nations, by the Letter at whose appearance all the worlds of letters prostrated themselves, and by the Word before which all the worlds of utterance bowed down in their entirety, to confirm Thy loved ones, Thy chosen ones, and Thy friends in steadfastness in Thy Cause and in Thy remembrance amidst Thy creatures. Then assist, O my God, in all conditions, him whom Thou hast made to arise in Thy service, to journey throughout the lands in Thy name and remembrance, and whom Thou hast named in this station the Trustworthy One as the Trustworthy. O Lord! Strengthen him, then enable him, then manifest through him in Thy cities and lands that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. All things have testified to Thy power. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the numerous letters of that spiritual beloved bestowed abundant spirit and fragrance upon heart and soul, and after their reading and perusal, having turned toward the most exalted Kingdom and having gained presence and leave in the most holy and most glorious Court, they were presented. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke, blessed and exalted be His utterance:</p>
<p>In My Name that shineth forth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>O Amin! The Wronged One remembereth thee from the direction of the Prison and giveth thee glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of the worlds. Let not that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought sadden thee - they who have denied God’s proof and testimony and have turned away from Him through Whose remembrance every perspicuous Book hath been adorned. The servant present hath presented thy letter before the Wronged One in the Prison. We have found from it the fragrance of thy love and have sent down for thee this wondrous Tablet that thou mayest find from it the fragrance of My love and give thanks unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! The verses of God have encompassed all regions and His evidences are more manifest than the sun at high noon. Yet the unjust servants have risen with the sword of tyranny to shed His blood. Nevertheless, the Ancient Beauty, from the Most Great Prison, hath commanded all to patience and forbearance, inasmuch as God, exalted be His glory, hath, in all Books, Scriptures, Psalms and Tablets, forbidden all in this Revelation from conflict, disputation and strife. Verily, He seeth and commandeth, and He is the All-Commanding, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>That which hath occurred in the Land of Ta was not wholly the fault of the government. God knoweth, thy Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth. From certain events they have imagined - God forbid - that the people of God are engaged in creating sedition. Glory be to God! Have they not seen the revealed Books and are they unaware of the recorded Scriptures? Every word that hath streamed from the Supreme Pen of the Lord of Names hath, with the most resonant call, counseled the people of creation to love, kindness, patience and forbearance. Every truthful one beareth witness to that which hath been mentioned, and every seeing one testifieth to the grace and justice of God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>Beseech ye God that He may make the people of the earth aware of the will of the true Sovereign. In this way, all shall be seen circling round His will. The Command is in His grasp; He doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty, and He is the All-Commanding, the All-Choosing. Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends in every land and say: Be not grieved by what hath befallen the loved ones. By God’s life! The actions of the oppressors are the cause of the exaltation of His Cause and its elevation. Ere long all shall witness that which the Supreme Pen hath recorded.</p>
<p>It behooveth the people of Baha to place their trust in all things in God. Verily, He is the Just, the All-Wise. He shall seize the oppressors as He seized those before them. He is, in truth, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty. O My chosen ones! Upon you be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Ye should, with the utmost yearning, longing, attraction and enkindlement, occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and be so inflamed with the fire of His love that the oppression of the oppressors, the hostility of the antagonists, and the hatred of the malicious may not hold you back from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Soon shall pass away the kingdom, and the king, and the subject, and all that ye behold today, and there shall endure for you what hath been sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The sun of divine favor is shining and the horizon of grace is bright and luminous. Although your honor is not physically present, yet inwardly you stand at the gate and are mentioned in the presence of the Beloved of the worlds. One letter from your honor arrived from Tiflis, bringing complete joy. God willing, you will in all conditions be occupied with the remembrance and service of God, and I beseech you to pray for this evanescent servant, that he may perchance succeed in rendering the service with which he hath been charged.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of the friends of that land, all were presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and each was honored with wondrous and glorious mention. Today grace is like a copious rain, flowing and streaming down from the heaven of loving-kindness. At all times He mentioneth His loved ones in the most wondrous utterance, and in truth, should a soul perceive the fragrance of such mention, the changes of the world and the oppression of the nations would neither sadden him nor hold him back from being set ablaze.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the spiritual beloved, His Holiness Varqa, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Names - news of his release from prison, and of events before and after, and of his arrival in the land of Ta, reached this evanescent servant. He [Baha’u’llah] said: “We heard the news of him and witnessed his enthusiasm, and We revealed for him during his imprisonment and upon his release that which brings joy to the eyes.”</p>
<p>Some time ago this servant sent him a letter containing the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet. God willing, may he attain the presence of the Divine Tablet and be gladdened by its fragrance.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about your intention to travel to other lands - I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that through the arrival and presence of that beloved one, He may adorn all those regions with the ornament of spring, and embellish the barren lands with the verdure of inner meanings. And may your very being have a profound effect upon souls, in such wise that the slumbering may awaken, the seated may arise, and the heedless may turn toward the ocean of knowledge. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Powerful, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding whether funds are needed to be obtained and transferred to that honored one, this matter was submitted. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur: “Hardship and ease, poverty and wealth have all been and continue to be within the grasp of God’s power, exalted be His glory. In all conditions that honored one should be confident. In His hand are the keys of wealth and within His grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>What that beloved one transferred from the house funds was received and obtained. And if anything further is needed hereafter, it will be obtained from known persons of this land through religion, and its repayment rests with God, exalted be His glory. That beloved one’s service, efforts, attention and steadfastness in God’s path are evident and clear, and are mentioned before the Intended One. On one occasion these exalted words were heard from the Tongue of the Lord of Creation - He said: “O servant present! His honor the Trustee (Amin) is in all conditions engaged in service to the Cause, and in truth has been and continues to be a well-wisher of the people of truth. During the days of presence, he would speak well of the friends of that land and the lands of Ta, Kha, Ya, Kaf and other regions, and would beseech and supplicate God’s wondrous favors for each one, and would ask from God, exalted be His glory, bounty and blessing for all. Blessed is he and joy be unto him!”</p>
<p>This evanescent one’s purpose is that all deeds, works and words are clear and evident before God. Praise be to God, that spiritual beloved has attained to a station to which the Tongue of God has testified and which the Supreme Pen has mentioned. One ocean of “well done” and one city of “well pleased” are needed, for this is a station which the near ones sought and hoped for. The Bab - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - says: “Strive that ye may attain unto the word of His good-pleasure.” The fruits of deeds and words become manifest and evident in the earth like the sun. If you wish to know about the conditions of the Land of Purpose [the Holy Land], a number of Afnan and others have arrived and stayed for a time in the shade with utmost joy and fragrance. A hundred thousand blessings upon those souls whom the blessed divine Lote-Tree has claimed as Its own. His is the praise in all conditions. We beseech Him to inscribe for them from His Supreme Pen the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to grant them what He has written for His chosen ones and His loved ones in the Crimson Tablet which was sent down from the heaven of His will. At present they are in Beirut and it is likely that some will attain His presence once again.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote regarding his honor Haji Ahmad and those related to him - upon them be the glory of God and His favors - it was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. This is what was sent down for them from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. He says, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Trustee! Mention was made of you before the Wronged One, and the servant present submitted what you had sent to him. We heard and have answered you with these verses that you might give thanks to your Lord, the Ancient Sender of Revelations. His honor A. and ?. whom you mentioned - praise be to God - drank at the beginning from the Euphrates of recognition and received their portion from the cup of certitude. There was sent down from the heaven of grace specifically for him that which is lasting and enduring. Likewise his sons are each mentioned and have attained God’s favors. By the life of God, abundant good has been mentioned and recorded for them in God’s Book.</p>
<p>Regarding your renewed mention of the beloved of the heart, his honor Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, this is what was revealed from the Kingdom of utterance of our Lord, the Most Merciful. His word, exalted and mighty be He: “Blessed is he who has turned to My horizon, soared in My atmosphere, spoken My praise, and held fast to My cord. He is indeed of the people of the pavilion of My glory, the companions of My Kingdom, and among those who have borne My throne and drunk the choice wine of My favor from the hands of My bounty.”</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! His honor Varqa, upon him be My glory and My favor, has in truth assisted the Cause of God and drawn receptive hearts to the realm of oneness. Convey to all the friends of God, wherever they may dwell, the greetings of the Wronged One, and say: You are the lamps of knowledge and have been lit by the hand of bounty. The lamp of divine love needs a crystal shade that it may be protected from the winds. The false ones pursue and the treacherous ones lie in wait; protect yourselves through the name of Truth. Today, the hosts of God have been and are mention, utterance, goodly deeds and spiritual qualities. By these hosts must the cities of hearts be conquered. The shedding of blood is forbidden. That which befits man’s station has been and is beloved, not contention and strife. Say: “Lord, pour forth upon us patience, make firm our steps, aid us, for Thou art the best of helpers.”</p>
<p>Whatever has occurred in the Land of ?a (Tehran) has caused and causes no harm. These events have been and are the cause of the exaltation of the Word. Through the violent, crushing winds, the sovereignty of the sea becomes manifest and evident, and its waves become known and visible. We counsel all to patience and steadfastness, and guide them to that which is befitting. God, exalted be His glory, is present and watchful, and whatever He willeth, He manifesteth and causeth to flow. Say: Consider the Chief (Sultan) and those around him who sent Me to the Most Great Prison, then observe what befell the Wolf and the Speckled Snake. Say: Verily, the True One is not far from you. The Truth caused all to return to their abodes in a brief time. He is the Almighty over whatsoever He willeth. Soon shall the foul winds vanish and become as naught. That which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen has been and shall remain. Rejoice in what hath been ordained for you by God, the Just, the Generous.</p>
<p>In days when the edifice of existence was shaken and the foundation of the world was made to tremble through the onslaught of the oppressors, this Wronged One arose alone to promote the Cause - an arising that no sitting could overtake and which was not prevented by the clamor of the polytheists and hypocrites. He guided the people of creation to the supreme horizon with the most great call. Now that the rays of the sun of revelation have somewhat appeared, from every corner a croaking is heard, a viper becomes manifest, and barking is raised. With the utmost craftiness and deceit, they strive to lead astray the holy souls who have accepted the faith, and in the garment of friendship and unity, they cause the helpless servants to deviate from the straight path of God. In their sweet words lies hidden a deadly poison, and in their praise is concealed the greatest censure. Say: O friends! Associate not with the people of hypocrisy, and be not content with the deceit and craftiness of the polytheists. This is the Day of God; mention of aught else is not permitted. Some have desired to renew the vain imaginings of the past and are now preparing the foundation thereof. Beseech ye God to keep all steadfast and not to deprive them from the ocean of His knowledge.</p>
<p>Know ye that in these days numerous letters have arrived from various places - from the Land of K and R and Y, and likewise from the beloved ones, his honor S and his honor H, upon them both be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious. There is no fresh news save that a croaking hath been raised in the Land of K.R - God, the Exalted, the Great, hath spoken truth. For after the revelation of the Most Holy Book from the heaven of grace, several verses were observed addressed to the Land of K and R. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof - is this: “O Land of K and R! We, verily, see thee in a state that God doth not love, and We perceive from thee that which none knoweth save God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And We find that which passeth from thee in the innermost secret. With Us is the knowledge of all things in a Preserved Tablet. Grieve not because of this, for God will raise up in thee men of mighty strength who will make mention of Me with such constancy that neither the pronouncements of the divines nor the whisperings of the evil ones will deter them. These will behold God with their own eyes and will aid His Cause with their own selves. These, verily, are of them that are firmly established.”</p>
<p>After observing these manifest verses, this servant waited for some time to see what would transpire. One day His honor Amin - who hath ascended to the Supreme Companion, and upon him be the glory of God and the glory of all who are in the heavens and the earth - was present before the face of Him Who standeth, when this exalted word issued from the mouth of the Will of the Lord of Names. His exalted Word is this: “O Amin! A foul odor emanateth from the Land of K and R.” After this blessed word, this evanescent servant watched and waited to see what would occur, until news arrived about Mirza Ahmad Kirmani. When this matter was mentioned in the presence of the Throne, He smiled and said: “Soon thou shalt see and hear.”</p>
<p>After hearing this blessed word, this servant remained silent. More than this it is not permissible to mention, but God protect us and you from the evil of these souls. A person hath written a letter with a thousand tricks and deceits, praising some while intending to exalt falsehood, and condemning others while aiming to prevent the seeker. Glory be to God! In what school have these souls been trained? But praise be to God, by divine grace whatever of mysteries, tricks and deceits he harbors in his heart is evident and manifest from his words. He hath clothed pure misguidance in the garment of truth and placed the crown of knowledge upon the head of absolute falsehood.</p>
<p>With utmost humility and supplication I beseech God - exalted be His glory - to guide him and establish him in truthfulness. How long will tyranny endure? How long will oppression continue? O helpless one! Where wert thou? Take a step in the path of the fair-minded and speak the truth. Today nothing is mentioned concerning the Bayan, neither above it nor below it, except through acceptance of Him Who is established upon the throne of His Cause. I mention one pearl from the ocean of the Merciful’s utterance, that perchance they may be content with it and strive no further to violate the Divine Cause. The Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - saith, exalted and mighty be His Word: “I have written the essence regarding His mention: He shall not be known by My allusions, nor by what hath been mentioned in the Bayan.”</p>
<p>O helpless one! Whatever thou dost mention from the Bayan is proof of heedlessness and transgression of bounds. If thou sayest “How do we know this is He?”, set aside selfish desires and ponder the verses, allusions, proofs and evidences that have appeared and become manifest. That which hath later appeared had formerly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and all bear witness to this. Moreover, read what thou hast and We shall read what We have, and let us speak with pure truthfulness and fairness. Where wert thou in those days when most were concealed in corners of seclusion from the assault of the times? This servant beseecheth God, his Lord, to grant them a drop from the ocean of justice and fairness. In truth, the entire Bayan is but a mention of this Most Great Announcement, even as the Point of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - Himself declareth: “The entire Bayan is but a leaf from among the leaves of the gardens of His knowledge.” If it be accepted as such - nevertheless, souls who, by the life of God, had no knowledge whatsoever of the origin of the Cause, have now risen in opposition and objection, galloping their steeds in the arena of ignorance and stubbornness. Say: Woe unto you! Soon shall ye find yourselves in manifest loss. In the days of departure from Iraq, all were informed of the cawing of the ravens and the birds of night. Assuredly, whatsoever flowed from the Pen shall come to pass. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to raise up such servants as shall arise with utmost steadfastness in His Cause and draw the people, through the life-giving waters of utterance, to the horizon of knowledge, in such wise that they shall regard all else besides God as utter nothingness and absolute void. Glory be to God! The heedlessness and ignorance of the servants hath reached such a pass that man is ashamed and abashed to mention it.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the trumpet was sounded and the dwellers of the graves arose, to assist Thy servants and creatures to justice and fairness. Then grant them, O my God, from the Kawthar of utterance that which will draw them nigh unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all religions! O my God and God of earth and heaven! Thou seest how the hearts of them that are nigh unto Thee have melted because of what hath befallen Thee at the hands of the oppressors among Thy creatures who have violated Thy covenant and Thy testament, and from whom have appeared such schemes and deceptions as have astonished Satan himself. They have occupied themselves, O my God, with that which Thou hast forbidden them in Thy Scriptures, Thy Tablets and Thy Books. They steal Thy verses and attribute them to other than Thee. I beseech Thee, O Cleaver of the dawn and Subduer of the winds, to send down from the heaven of Thy bounty upon Thy creation that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and cause them to recognize what Thou hast willed in Thy days. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Although such deeds have appeared from the idolaters and deniers as are the cause and reason for despair and deprivation, it is very difficult for them to succeed in returning or in showing fairness and justice, unless the hand of grace takes hold and delivers them. He is the Mighty and Powerful. In Jamadi’l-Avval, their honors “AF” - upon them be all the Most Glorious Glory - returned from pilgrimage to the House, attained the presence, and for more than a month dwelt in the shadow and were blessed with the bounty of the meeting and the Kawthar of attainment. Blessed be it unto them and may they enjoy it. The letter which that beloved one wrote to the spiritual friend, His Honor Husayn Aqa - upon him be the Glory of God - they sent to this servant. It was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Threshold, and regarding the matter of the handmaiden of God and her intention to perform pilgrimage, it was accepted before the Throne. We beseech God to cause this grace to flow for those who are near, the seekers and the hopeful ones, that they may not be deprived of the outpourings of the divine days. From His Honor “AF”, His Honor “A” and “?” - upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - several letters reached this evanescent one. The response to some was submitted and sent, and others will be sent in these days. And from every place petitions are arriving - may God grant success that this servant be assisted to respond. Verily He is powerful over all things. No other new matter has occurred to be submitted. These days are the days of tyranny - dark clouds have prevented the lights of the sun of justice. However, the Will of God has prevailed and continues to prevail. The intentions of all the world cannot prevent His Will. His Purpose is penetrating, His Will is sovereign, His Knowledge encompasses all, and His Power prevails. Where is Nimrod and what he intended? Where is Pharaoh and what he did? Where is Shaddad and his dominion? Where is the Mighty One and his oppression? Where is the Wolf and his rule? Where is the Serpent and his rebellion? Where is the Truth and the Sword? And where are those who committed what caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament? All with utmost haste returned to their abodes. God our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earth has spoken truth. Soon the remaining tyrannical souls will likewise turn to their dwellings. According to the Command, all friends must hold fast to patience and perseverance and keep their gaze fixed upon the horizons of divine ordinances. God, exalted be His glory, alone will grant victory and suffice against the evil of the oppressors. The victory of the friends has been and is spiritual qualities and pure, holy deeds. Repeatedly from the Tongue of Grandeur this word was heard, His word, exalted and mighty be He […]</p>
<p>O servant who stands present! The Almighty Truth has ever had and continues to have powerful hosts, among them the hosts of utterance, the hosts of goodly deeds, and the hosts of praiseworthy character. Likewise, trustworthiness, truthfulness, and religious devotion are all among the hosts of God, and no host can withstand these hosts. We beseech God to aid His loved ones in that which leads to the exaltation of the Word and the station of man.</p>
<p>If the friends are aided to act according to what has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, assuredly its effects will become manifest and evident in the world. Today, goodly deeds must… In most Tablets, utterances have been revealed which, were they to be cast upon rock, would cause it to flow. Glory be to God! The hearts of the servants are observed to be like solid rock - the Word of Truth does not penetrate them. This servant beseeches his Lord to protect His chosen ones from the evil of these people and from their schemes and deceptions. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer.</p>
<p>Two individuals from M and Y attained the presence, and likewise a person from S. May God assist them all to remain steadfast. That beloved one has truly been the cause of the manifestation of God’s favor to each of the friends, even as during their presence mention was made of each of the loved ones from various cities and regions, and for each one specifically did the sun of favor shine from the horizon of grace. Your honor should remind the people of those regions so that they may turn with permission and not render such a mighty deed without effect or fruit.</p>
<p>To the divine loved ones in those lands I say that the Day is most great and the Cause is most great, while the treacherous ones and thieves lie in wait. The clamor has been raised, and this is among the divine promises that were revealed and recorded at the time of departure from Baghdad and other lands. God our Lord and the Lord of all worlds has spoken true. They are engaged in all manner of schemes and stratagems. Among other things, they have stolen divine verses - some they have attributed to the Bab (may our souls be sacrificed for His sake) and sent to various regions, while others they have claimed as their own. They have collected wondrous books and exalted verses. One soul has appeared with such deception that Satan himself is bewildered by it. Say: Die in your wrath! This is the Day of God, if you be of those who know. None is mentioned therein save Him, despite your will, O company of polytheists! He has appeared with the truth, and the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, have testified to Him.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! If this Revelation is denied, to whom can one cling and adhere? Be fair, O peoples of the earth, and be not among the losers. If that beloved one should turn towards that land, they should be vigilant, for the hypocrite has donned the garment of the faithful and casts forth hatred in the name of love. In brief, they have been and continue to be the dawning-places of conjecture and the manifestations of idle fancies. I beseech God to protect His loved ones from the evil of those false, heedless, deceitful, and rebellious souls. At this moment when this evanescent servant was engaged in writing this letter, he was summoned to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, whereupon He, exalted be His glory, spoke […]</p>
<p>O servant in attendance! We wish to mention R. and J. who has turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and clung to the hem of his Lord’s grace, the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, that he may rejoice in My remembrance and My grace, and be among the thankful ones. We bid him to show forth the Greater Steadfastness, that through him may be manifested that which will cause the limbs of those who have denied God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, to quake. The Glory shining from the horizon of eternity be upon him and upon those with him who have held fast to the Strong Cord of God.</p>
<p>This servant conveys greetings to them and submits that people are weak and heedless, and the practitioners of guile and deceit are many. May He protect the righteous from the evil of the wicked in the name of God, exalted be His glory. Those who from the beginning of the Cause had and have no understanding whatsoever consider themselves among the people of knowledge and insight. Briefly, it is submitted that they have intended to devise vain imaginings like those of the past and deprive helpless souls from the straight path. If someone truly and sincerely reflects for the sake of God, he will testify that the cause and reason for the martyrdom of the Primal Point, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, as well as the saints and chosen ones, were all due to the schemes of certain individuals of the past. Had I been granted permission, I would have submitted that which would awaken the slumbering and raise up the seated, but the matter is not in my hands, rather in the hands of my Lord, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Strong, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches God to assist that beloved one in that which will cause him to be remembered throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Verily, He is powerful over all things. May that beloved one deliver this leaf to them that they may observe. In these days, a letter arrived from the honored beloved Nabil-i-Qabli-Ba, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, from the land of Ta, and likewise from the spiritual beloved Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God. Praise be to God, it conveyed the joy, delight, attraction and gladness of the friends, and it was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court. The rays of the sun of grace shone forth and became manifest in relation to each one. This servant’s submission is that greetings and salutations to all friends, masters and beloved ones from this servant are dependent upon and contingent on the grace of that honored master. The Glory that is manifest and evident from the horizon of our Lord’s grace be upon you and upon God’s friends in His lands and His chosen ones in His realms, and upon every steadfast and upright one. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>The flashes of the light of His countenance enraptured me</p>
<p>Before whose radiance all suns grow dim</p>
<p>As though the lightning of the sun, from the light of His beauty</p>
<p>Appeared in all the worlds and shone forth</p>
<p>From His splendor the musk of heaven was stirred</p>
<p>From His exaltation the spirit of the heights was elevated</p>
<p>By His breath the trumpets of resurrection were blown</p>
<p>By His fragrance the shadow of clouds passed by</p>
<p>By His gleaming the Mount of Eternity was made manifest</p>
<p>By His brilliance the light of Glory was revealed</p>
<p>From its setting place the Sun of Manifestation appeared[…]</p>
<p>The rising of the sun from its setting place,</p>
<p>While from her dawning-place shone forth the moons of the months.</p>
<p>From her tresses the sweet fragrance of union was diffused,</p>
<p>And from her glance the eye of beauty was illumined.</p>
<p>By the light of her face was the Face of Guidance guided;</p>
<p>By the fire of her countenance was the Spirit of Moses sanctified.</p>
<p>[By the fire of her countenance was the Light of Radiance manifested.]</p>
<p>From the sweet-scented breaths of her poetry, the fragrance of joy and splendor and the musk of mercy and glory wafted from the north wind of the Paradise of the Divine Essence, which had spread from the right hand of the Garden of the Divine Unity, stirring and moving, that perchance the decayed bones of the realities of contingent beings might, through its heart-ravishing breezes and soul-refreshing fragrances, attain unto eternal life and everlasting existence through this novel and matchless wine, and might glory in the glory of existence. Likewise from her countenance, the eye of True Beauty - of which the sun in the heaven of existence is but a sign - became illumined and radiant through beholding it. Glorified then be God, her Creator, above all that ye mention.</p>
<p>When Moses cleansed the Man of the divine Spirit, Who was deposited in human form, from the sandals of incidental doubts, and revealed the Hand of divine Power from the Bosom of Grandeur and the Mantle of Grace, He entered the holy, goodly, blessed Valley of the Heart, which is the seat of the Throne of the Divine Manifestation and the Chair of holy lordly utterance. And when He reached that Mount of Sinai which stretched forth from the right side of the Spot of Light, He inhaled the sweet fragrance of the Spirit from the everlasting Orient, and perceived the lights of the Ancient Being from all directions without direction. From the heat of the divine fragrance of love and the firebrands of the flames of the fire of Oneness, the Lamp of Identity was kindled and blazed in the Lamp of His heart after the glass veils of self were removed. And He attained the Valley of eternal sobriety through the wine of reunion with the peerless Countenance and the pure wine of the Everlasting Lord, after the opposing stations were effaced. And through the rapture of the longing for attainment, He discovered the City of the joy of eternity and entered the City when its people were unaware. Then did He find solace in the fire of the Ancient God and was illumined by the light of the Great God, even as He said to His people: “Tarry ye; lo, I perceive a fire.”</p>
<p>And when He apprehended the Face of the guidance of infinite favors from the Tree that is neither of the East nor of the West, He was honored and glorified in passing from the perishing face of otherness to the enduring Face of the Eternal. And He found the wondrous, transcendent Face of guidance in the kindled Fire that was hidden in the mystic hearts. This is why He said: “or find guidance at the Fire.” Likewise understand the meaning of the blessed verse which sayeth: “Who hath made for you fire from the green tree.” Would that an ear could be found that We might mention a drop from the deep ocean of fire and this vast, boundless sea of flame. But it is better that this pearl remain hidden in the shell of the sea of Identity and stored in the vessels of mystery, that every stranger might be deprived and every intimate one might become intimate with the Sanctuary of Glory and enter the Sacred Precinct of Beauty.</p>
<p>How blessed, then, is the soul that melteth the cage of the body in the fire of love and becometh intimate with the Spirit itself, that it might attain to the exalted mercy of rest and be sustained by the supreme bounty of glory. All that hath been mentioned regarding the stations of guidance and the ranks of the purification of the self referreth, in the station of Moses (upon our Prophet and upon Him be peace), to the manifestation of these effulgences in the visible world. Otherwise, that Presence was ever guided by the guidance of God and ever shall be. Nay, rather, the Sun of guidance dawned forth from Him, and the Moon of providence appeared through Him, and the Fire of Identity was kindled from the fire of His Essence, and the Light of Eternity was illumined from the light of His brow. His own words remove these doubts, when, at the time Pharaoh questioned Him about the slain one, He answered: “I did it then when I was of those who err. So I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the Messengers.”</p>
<p>The page is complete, else the theme is endless and remaineth […]</p>
<p>The arched eyebrows caused the head of existence to extend</p>
<p>For her arrow they named the glance, and eyelashes are the place of their growth, and the snare is from that which entangles, meaning a lasso - that is, the illumined and pure breasts have turned toward and welcomed the arrow of the eyelashes of the Most Exalted Beloved, ready to be struck by it; and for the snare of His tresses, the head of the divine universal unseen existence has extended itself to be caught in that snare. Deprived remains the breast that attains not that arrow, and non-existent becomes the head that enters not that snare. Glory be unto Him above what we describe of Him, and exalted is He above what ye describe.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is the place where Her feet fall</p>
<p>And the throne of the heaven is earth whereon She walks</p>
<p>And in every eye have I wept for union with Her</p>
<p>And in every fire have I burned from separation</p>
<p>Meaning that all the holy and exalted eyes that are secretly concealed in the worlds of the unseen, and the visible eyes that exist in the kingdom, in every station and every time that they wept and were weeping, it was from separation from this servant upon beholding the lights of the beauty of that Beloved. This is what is understood from the outer meaning of the verse, and as for its inner meaning, none knoweth it save God, and we know not of it save less than a single letter. Likewise understand the meaning of the other verse, that perchance delight and yearning and attraction and bewilderment and love and affection may come to exist in the world of thy being, that thou mayest attain the honor of reaching thy Sadratu’l-Muntaha and Masjid-i-Aqsa, which is submission to the decree and command of God. Verily your Lord, the Most High, is in truth a witness over you and in justice a guardian over us.</p>
<p>I stretched forth with all stretching to cast Her feet</p>
<p>Upon my heart, and this was my first desire</p>
<p>I sought union’s presence in every direction,</p>
<p>And inscribed the letters of nearness upon every soil.</p>
<p>Though I hastened to unite with its light,</p>
<p>Distance’s arrow struck me after my proximity.</p>
<p>And when I raised my hands to extend our union,</p>
<p>The sword cut me - such is the reward of His loved ones.</p>
<p>My concern was only to grasp the firm handle,</p>
<p>And its purpose was only to sever my connection.</p>
<p>I said to it: “My soul be thy sacrifice,</p>
<p>And what prevents me from meeting thee?</p>
<p>Have mercy, and expose not my disgrace!”</p>
<p>[Note: This appears to be a mystical poem expressing the soul’s yearning for divine union, with an accompanying Persian commentary explaining that “upon every soil” refers to all levels of existence, from the highest realms hidden in the unseen to the lowest earthly plane, in hopes that the “foot” might enter the heart where divine mysteries are concealed - this being the ultimate desire of sanctified hearts.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O God! Whatever stations of utterance and meaning I have attained, and whatever I have known therein of the conditions of Names and Attributes, and whatever God has granted me in the worlds of the unseen and the visible - all would I sacrifice to meet Thee but once, or to behold Thee with a single glance. I ask Thy forgiveness, O my God, at this moment for what I have claimed before Thee. Yet, by Thy glory, O my God, if I am not thus, I desire through Thy power to become so, for without this neither would anything profit me nor would my heart find peace, even wert Thou to give me all that is in the heavens and the earth. Therefore, I beseech Thee, O my God, by Him Who hath borne in Thy path what none other hath borne, to send down upon Thy servant from the signs of Thy supreme love and the tokens of Thy most glorious affection until my soul becomes content with what it hopes for. Verily, Thou art powerful over all things.</p>
<p>And from me, through excessive love for Thee, through union</p>
<p>I shall keep it enduring in eternal time</p>
<p>And a mystery of manifestation shone forth from her manifestation</p>
<p>All beings, and through the Origin my resurrection was established</p>
<p>And the sorrow of Husayn, I have borne for his grief</p>
<p>The cycles of existence in the realm of my example</p>
<p>Thou art the hope of my heart and the Beloved of my innermost being</p>
<p>The Master of my spirit, my Light and my very soul</p>
<p>From Me was granted reunion’s joy after parting,</p>
<p>And He bestowed upon me the spirit of fellowship after my anguish.</p>
<p>From my burning the fire of passion was kindled,</p>
<p>And from my sighs the light of witness was made manifest.</p>
<p>The sea of the divine cloud from the heat of my thirst dried up,</p>
<p>And the river of splendor could not quench any of my thirst.</p>
<p>In every dust of all blood that I witnessed,</p>
<p>Lo! It tells of the blood of my eyes.</p>
<p>And from my tears the encompassing sea is but a drop,</p>
<p>And from my burning the fire of the Friend is but an ember,</p>
<p>And from my sorrow the sea of joy was frozen […]</p>
<p>From my grief the essence of sorrows has flowed,</p>
<p>My light has dimmed and my radiance is veiled,</p>
<p>And my light is extinguished by the delusion of those who gloat over my misfortune.</p>
<p>Verily, more numerous than the particles in existence, by God, what no eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor soul hath reckoned, nor mind hath known, like a torrential rain hath descended from the heaven of the heedlessness of the servants. Say: O people of the earth! Do not oppose him in whose heart there is naught but the effulgence from the lights of the morn of eternity. Fear God and oppose not; if ye love not, at least hate not. If the love of God exists, the absence of all else matters not. We praise God for having made us independent of their love and their remembrance, and He is God, powerful over all things.</p>
<p>My bones are worn and my body is wasted,</p>
<p>And my heart is scorched from the heat of its burning.</p>
<p>Thy passion hath bewildered me and Thy love hath tested me,</p>
<p>And Thy separation hath dissolved me while union with Thee is my desire.</p>
<p>And from the secret of my sorrow the heavens were nearly rent asunder,</p>
<p>And from the anguish of my heart the earth of the soul was cleft.</p>
<p>My heart’s burning is reflected in my tears,</p>
<p>And from the sighing of my innermost being my countenance has grown pale.</p>
<p>I moan throughout the night from those who gloat over my misfortune,</p>
<p>And persist throughout the day from the loss of my help.</p>
<p>I have reached such a station of abasement</p>
<p>That every tongue is wearied from its mention.</p>
<p>The maidens of the palaces, from the grief of my heart,</p>
<p>Have donned garments of black in every chamber.</p>
<p>In every corner have I encountered sorrow,</p>
<p>In every expansion have I found contraction.</p>
<p>And she called to me from behind, saying “Be silent” […]</p>
<p>Take thy tongue from all that thou hast told,</p>
<p>For how many a Husayn like thee hath sought Me,</p>
<p>And how many an ’Ali like thee hath loved Me,</p>
<p>How many a beloved one above thee hath cherished Me,</p>
<p>And how many a chosen one thy peer from among My pure ones.</p>
<p>Each cried out through all ages yet attained not</p>
<p>To the light of union, even for an instant, through My glance.</p>
<p>From My dawning-place the Sun of Manifestation is as a star,</p>
<p>And from My Manifestation the light of creation is as a gleam,</p>
<p>And from the light of My mystery the mystery of existence is as an ant,</p>
<p>And from the fire of My love the fire of existence is as a brand.</p>
<p>From My nature, which God has created, I have become religious,</p>
<p>And from My palm the radiance of light has been gathered.</p>
<p>The Command of the Command has come from a manifest Command,</p>
<p>And the justice of the decree has come from the justice of My wisdom.</p>
<p>The waves of the sea have been stilled by My inner waves,</p>
<p>And the Holy Spirit has been stirred by the light of My glory.</p>
<p>From My glance did Moses of eternity fall unconscious,</p>
<p>And from My radiance were the mountains of Sinai crushed.</p>
<p>From the spreading of My Cause were the souls gathered together,</p>
<p>From the breath of My Spirit did the decayed bones stir to life.</p>
<p>The Cause itself hath circled round her dwelling,</p>
<p>And the Spirit of the House hath risen from the light of my countenance.</p>
<p>The dominion of the loftiest knowledge lieth in the letter Ba,</p>
<p>And the Ba of the outward manifestation of the mystery hath prostrated before my Point.</p>
<p>All guidance hath appeared from the dayspring of my Cause,</p>
<p>And all exaltation hath descended from my delegation.</p>
<p>The birds sing forth my melody as a tune,</p>
<p>And from my song comes the plaintive strain of the emaciated ones.</p>
<p>Thou hast ordained a law based on evil thoughts about me,</p>
<p>And hast drunk, in love of another, from other than my spring.</p>
<p>I came with attributes and brought forth a connection,</p>
<p>And cast forth names from the evenness of my path.</p>
<p>I described with self and its connection to my self,</p>
<p>This is the limit, and limitation is the gravest error.</p>
<p>You hoped through your assumption for union with me - far from it!</p>
<p>This was not the condition that was set, if you had fulfilled, it would have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>So drink the cup of affliction from every chalice,</p>
<p>And be given to drink blood of oppression from the heart’s blood.</p>
<p>Cut off hope from touching any rest,</p>
<p>And suppress desire from coveting any need.</p>
<p>The shedding of blood in the path of love is obligatory,</p>
<p>And the burning of the innermost heart in love was from my first covenant.</p>
<p>Consider love’s claim abandoned, or be content with what transpires,</p>
<p>For thus flows the decree in what My ways ordain.</p>
<p>I called to her in secret, saying: “O My beloved,</p>
<p>O ultimate desire of My hopes and purpose of My mystery!</p>
<p>Here am I, present before Thy power,</p>
<p>Here am I, hopeful despite what has been arrayed;</p>
<p>Here am I, seeking all that Thou dost love.</p>
<p>Through sleepless nights from the sting of every striker,</p>
<p>And the continuous assault each passing day,</p>
<p>When from My path the deadly venom comes as but a drink,</p>
<p>And from My faith the force of fate appears as mere compassion.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Here am I inclined with what Thou hast decreed,</p>
<p>My breast yearning for the spears of Thy dominion,</p>
<p>And this my body longing for the swords of Thy conquest.</p>
<p>Thy fire is my light and Thy wrath my desire,</p>
<p>Thy might is my comfort and Thy decree my aspiration.</p>
<p>Behold how my tears flow forth,</p>
<p>And witness how my heart’s essence has dissolved away.</p>
<p>Every day am I struck by the spears of all,</p>
<p>Every night am I slain by the sword of rejection.</p>
<p>In every line I read the book of unbelief,</p>
<p>In every moment I win the curse of all,</p>
<p>In every instant am I pierced by the thrust of polytheism[…]</p>
<p>Mercy itself has been banished in all times</p>
<p>As though the calamities of the age had descended upon my soul</p>
<p>As though the swords of wrath were sharpened for my neck</p>
<p>The sorrow of Jacob and the imprisonment of Joseph</p>
<p>And the affliction of Job and the fire [of my Friend]</p>
<p>The grief of Adam and the flight of Jonah</p>
<p>And the lamentation of David and the wailing of [Noah]</p>
<p>The separation of Eve and the anguish of Mary</p>
<p>And the tribulation of Isaiah and the distress of [Zechariah]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>From the outpouring of my sorrow all that was ordained has been ordained,</p>
<p>And from the overflow of my grief every affliction has appeared.</p>
<p>Behold my wandering through the lands without companion,</p>
<p>And witness my solitude in the wilderness with desolation.</p>
<p>From the opening of my eye, the eye of heaven poured forth,</p>
<p>And from the daybreak of my heart, the earth received the dawning waters.</p>
<p>From the spirit of my sorrow, the spirit of eternity was rent asunder,</p>
<p>And from the light of my grief, the throne of the exalted ones was brought low.</p>
<p>The crimson of existence turned red from the blood of my heart,</p>
<p>The branch of being sprouted from the tears of my eye.</p>
<p>The bitterness of tribulation in the path of Thy love is sweet […]</p>
<p>The cup of everlasting life from other than Thee is bitter</p>
<p>And around my neck the mark of iron chains is manifest</p>
<p>And upon my feet the trace of fetters still remains</p>
<p>Not a day passes except that I am consumed</p>
<p>By the allusions of poetry or the declarations of prose</p>
<p>My spirit has departed and my heart has melted</p>
<p>And my innermost being overflows from the intensity of my tribulation</p>
<p>I remain without spirit, heart, or soul</p>
<p>And the survival of my self is my greatest bewilderment</p>
<p>From the loftiness of my inner reality has been decreed what has befallen me</p>
<p>Would that my nature had never been raised to such heights</p>
<p>Thus has calamity encompassed me from every direction,</p>
<p>And so has destiny destroyed me at every moment.</p>
<p>I have ascended to the ultimate heights of oneness in unity,</p>
<p>And reached the very spring of divine presence in my inmost heart.</p>
<p>My description of Thee in describing mine own self I witnessed,</p>
<p>Through Thine eye in every piercing glance.</p>
<p>Whether through limitation, the limitation is manifest from Thee,</p>
<p>Or through attributes, the attributes are made evident from Thee.</p>
<p>Through my darkness, the gloom of nights became manifest,</p>
<p>And through my joy, the light of day became purified.</p>
<p>No matter then if I am now cast out,</p>
<p>For I have attained the supreme light on the day of my resurrection.</p>
<p>O that is through the Holy Spirit from the light of His companionship</p>
<p>And I migrated through Ta in the time of my estrangement</p>
<p>And I believed in the Light from the light of my inner being</p>
<p>And I ascended through the Spirit in the secret of my innermost heart</p>
<p>I call upon Thee, O Spirit of Life, to depart</p>
<p>From a self wherein naught remaineth of remnants</p>
<p>O Spirit of the divine cloud, descend from the Throne</p>
<p>For thou hast no measure of my abasement</p>
<p>O my companion, O my heart, come forth</p>
<p>For thou hast no glory in lands of degradation</p>
<p>O my patience, be patient in all that thou witnesseth</p>
<p>In the good-pleasure of thy Beloved, through hardship and ease</p>
<p>The Spirit called unto me and said: Be patient!</p>
<p>For I have known all that thou hast proven.</p>
<p>Put aside what thou hast known and to which thou hast cleaved,</p>
<p>For partnership with Me is as oneness.</p>
<p>The most glorious splendor of Sinai is to Me but chaff,</p>
<p>And the most radiant light of illumination is to Me as darkness.</p>
<p>The verses describing Thee are truth, but for youths,</p>
<p>The traces of Thy attributes are true, but [for my subjects].</p>
<p>I have ever dwelt in holiness,</p>
<p>And I shall forever [remain] in purity.</p>
<p>How many a just one hath been to Me as an oppressor!</p>
<p>How many a learned one hath been to Me as the ignorant!</p>
<p>How many an enduring one was as naught in My presence</p>
<p>How many a mystic shall never know [My craft]</p>
<p>How many a worshipper was but a transgressor before Me</p>
<p>How many a prostrate one shall never find glory [in prostration to Me]</p>
<p>The books of heaven in My being are fixed</p>
<p>The scrolls of radiance have descended from My scroll</p>
<p>From My atom the sun of the universe was enfolded</p>
<p>From My drop the ocean of existence flowed forth</p>
<p>All the wealth possessed by the peoples of the earth</p>
<p>Appeareth before Me as the chirping of an ant or the buzzing of a bee</p>
<p>All minds, from the attraction of My mystery, have been bewildered</p>
<p>All souls from the essence of My rapture have been made to live</p>
<p>And all deities from the sprinklings of My Cause have been deified</p>
<p>And all lords from the overflow of My wisdom have been made lords</p>
<p>The earth of the spirit hath moved at My command</p>
<p>And the throne of Sinai hath been the place of My footsteps</p>
<p>Through My light hath the star of manifestation shone forth</p>
<p>Through My spirit hath the sun of joy become manifest</p>
<p>Comprehensive verses, resplendent in their descent</p>
<p>Sites of traces, dawning-places of holiness</p>
<p>Jewels of thoughts, models of contemplation</p>
<p>Embroideries of lights, exemplars of wisdom</p>
<p>From the Kaf of My Cause their decree hath been ordained for all […]</p>
<p>The world of Command is meant -</p>
<p>From My subtle hidden grace all wondrous things appeared,</p>
<p>Yet thou didst turn away from My face and in thy fancy approached them,</p>
<p>And made the water of delusion flow in the stream of vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Thou wast not steadfast in the light of the unseen in what thou didst create</p>
<p>Within thyself, and thus didst thou waste My handiwork.</p>
<p>In other words, the Verse of Divine Splendor - which emerged from the effulgent lights of the mystic morn of eternity and the dawning rays of the holy Sun of Glory, radiating forth from the Sun of Being, the Moon of Purpose and the Point of Adoration - shone upon the realities of all contingent things, the essences of created hearts, and all atoms of existence. Through drops from the divine waters of being and sprinklings from the pure crystalline streams of eternality, it conferred everlasting life upon all things mentioned and adorned them with enduring robes, exalted garments, and eternal vestments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have not stood firm before such a supreme verse, magnificent gift, unquenchable lights and inexhaustible bounties. We have not risen to this consummate handiwork, assured grace, ancient glory and eternal subtlety. We remain veiled from the holy breaths of the Spirit and the fragrant winds of the Light of Fellowship, to such extent that were a thousand Davids of existence to chant the psalms and melodies of joy with wondrous new tones over the decayed bones of the servants, they would never stir or move. For the capacity to receive mercy from the heaven of power has vanished, and all have become imprisoned and stupefied in the cage of self and passion. They have been so thunderstruck in the realm of heedlessness that they will never regain consciousness nor reach the station of true union and nearness which is the ultimate purpose.</p>
<p>What regret and remorse that we were not guided by the essence of guidance nor followed the primal exemplar! Neither did we approach the Sinai of His nearness nor emulate His precious Manifestations. We did not respond to the attractions of His holy Spirit nor follow the lights of His glory. Among the ways of emulation is the sacrifice of spirits, which we did not achieve, and the wearing of the garment of steadfastness, which we did not attain.</p>
<p>Yes, we sit at the heart of the sea of identity waiting for a drink of water, and dwell in the shade of the Sun of Eternality while seeking a lamp. This is the condition of this servant and all people in every land. And if a fire is kindled from the Tree, they do not light from it but rather strive to extinguish it. Blessed is he who dons the cloak of justice in this arena. If you become adorned with this supreme attribute, you will surely attain the Most Glorious favor.</p>
<p>This is that hidden golden thread by whose motion all existence moves and by whose stillness all in the lands of the Worshipped One become still. Therefore, hearts must be illumined and purified from corrupt, uprooted, and evil suppositions, so that the wondrous countenance of justice may emerge from behind Mount Qaf. Then we may perceive the overwhelming divine ecstasies and godly attractions from the wingbeats of the Dove of Immortality and the palms of the spirits of glory, and find rest and dwelling upon the cushions of love.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate purpose and the nearest station. Furthermore, we must turn away from those who turn away from truth in all things, and not allow fellowship and association with them for even a moment. For I swear by God that corrupt souls melt pure souls just as fire consumes dry wood and heat melts cold snow. Be not among those whose hearts are hardened to the remembrance of God.</p>
<p>In any case, all that was mentioned was in interpretation of this verse, as a kindness to the eyes of the opposers […]</p>
<p>And the cold heat and snow - be not among those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God. The explanations given in interpreting this verse were graciously offered for the consideration of the opposers and mercifully for the eyes of the antagonists, lest they interpret and explain these verses according to their own desires. These verses were written during the time of migration in the lands of exile in the Turkish territories, and none of the learned or distinguished ones of those regions raised any objection or criticism. However, due to the ferocity of these people, I suspect that even after this explanation they will still object and, in their imagination, will follow paths of fancy, error, conjecture and blindness. Say: God points out the way, whether one be grateful or ungrateful, whether one turns toward Him or turns away. When the seal of the musk vessel is opened, every possessor of smell perceives it while one with a cold remains deprived. And if all were afflicted with colds, no deficiency would affect the eternal perfume nor any weakness touch the unerring musk.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I call upon Thee in this hour when there have descended upon me from the signs of Thy sorrow that which, were it to overflow upon existence, would cause both the unseen and the visible to cease to be, to such extent that the spirit nearly departed from its trembling. By Thy might and the mystery of Thy Self-Sufficiency! Were I to breathe of it, it would burn hearts to their very essence and would cause the heavens and all within them to be cleft asunder, and would cause the earth and all upon it to crumble. Therefore, alas! alas! Because of this the fragrance of faithfulness will not waft from the garden of glory, and the sweet perfume of eternity will not blow from the city of Baha, and the dove of the unseen will not warble upon the crimson branches, and the cock of paradise will not crow in the supreme kingdom. By the might of Him Whom Thou hast glorified and made the Manifestation of Thy Divinity and the Source of Thy Lordship, I have forgotten all remembrances and all that Thou hadst taught me before of the wonders of Thy knowledge and the all-comprehensive verses of Thy wisdom. Nay rather, I became as one completely forgotten, as though I had never been visible in the realm of existence. By the life of Ali, and the soul of Muhammad, and the spirit of the Chosen One, and the mercy of the Merciful One, and the attraction of the Praised One, and the rapture of Ahmad, and the joy of the Beloved One, and the delight of Tahir - I do not wish to exist in the kingdom for a single moment while God is my witness behind me.</p>
<p>Hold fast to the cord of the Command in the outer form</p>
<p>Recognize the Face of Light in the inner mystery</p>
<p>Rend asunder the veil of nearness without hint</p>
<p>Witness the Beauty of Holiness within thyself without unveiling</p>
<p>Be still, for the pillars of the Throne have trembled</p>
<p>Be patient, for the eyes of the unseen have wept,</p>
<p>And a meaning beyond knowledge in thee is concealed.</p>
<p>Every illumined mind is powerless to comprehend it;</p>
<p>Take delight and comfort in the holy mystery it contains.</p>
<p>Divulge it not if thou wouldst be My trusted one;</p>
<p>Were the veil to be lifted from the face of what thou hast witnessed,</p>
<p>All existence would perish in the twinkling of an eye;</p>
<p>Thus hath the matter proceeded from the Throne of Glory,</p>
<p>Thus hath the decree gone forth from the mystery of My power.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who attain by virtue of their faithfulness,</p>
<p>Blessed are they who enter into the law of My new Revelation,</p>
<p>Blessed are they who, in their love, shed their blood.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who grasp the cord of My loving-kindness,</p>
<p>Blessed are the sincere ones who hasten</p>
<p>From every direction beneath the shade of My divinity.</p>

<p>=== START BH00116 ===</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! May the esteemed son 202 [Ali Muhammad], the Name of God the Most Truthful, upon them both be all the most glorious glory, take note.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Ancient, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified beyond word and meaning, is befitting and worthy of the most holy and most sacred threshold of the Lord of creation, Who, in these days when the darkness of oppression hath encompassed the world, guideth all to the straight path and the great announcement through the light of justice. He is the Omnipotent One Whom the ranks of polytheism cannot diminish His oneness, nor can the hosts of nations prevent Him from His Cause. He is able to cause the light of justice to shine forth from the darkness of oppression, and from a drop of corruption make manifest an ocean of reformation. Who can stand against Him and who can claim to know Him or draw nigh unto Him? Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! We are all powerless.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of oppression and justice, and in Whose right hand are the reins of punishment and grace. I beseech Thee by the wafting of the breezes of Thy bounty and the flowing of the river of Thy mercy to aid Thy loved ones through Thy generosity and grace, and deliver them from the prison of those who have denied Thy truth and disputed Thy signs. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest that this servant desired to make mention of him who hath arisen to serve Thy Cause and circulated Thy laws throughout Thy lands. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds, Who hath appeared through the Most Great Name, to assist him with true assistance and aid him with the hosts of Thy Cause. Then make him, O my God, to be honored through Thy glory and enkindled with the fire of Thy love in such wise that neither the howling of the people in Thy Day nor the clamor of Thy servants shall quench that which Thou hast willed through Thy power and might. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! My delay hath been prolonged, and my patience and composure have exceeded moderation in a place where patience and composure are not befitting save by the command of God, the Manifest, the Evident, the Omnipotent, the Hidden. Great regret hath been occasioned, for this evanescent one hath not been able for some time to respond to the letters of that beloved of the heart. The cause and reason for this hath been the enkindling of the fire of oppression and corruption, and the lack of capacity among the servants. In truth, were one to reflect a little, utter amazement would result, for every soul hath been and is the recipient of manifold bounties and countless favors, such as hearing, sight, heart, understanding, and both outward and inward senses. Nevertheless, they are seen as though dead. Most strange of all is that man observeth the changes and variations in the world, yet clingeth to that which is destined to perish, remaining heedless and deprived of the eternal and everlasting bounty. He hath not and cannot have assurance of life for even an hour, yet he maketh provision for generations and ages to come. I beseech God to grant true vision to the eyes, for these sights have yielded and yield no fruit. How many a blind one hath heard and turned unto God, attaining the lights of the Countenance after the passing away of all things, and how many a seeing one hath been deprived and forbidden from beholding with his eyes. Glory be unto Him! Glory be unto Him! Verily, the Cause is in His hand, and success is in His grasp, and assistance is in His right hand. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>After observing and perusing the last letter of that spiritual beloved, which was adorned with the date of the twenty-ninth of Jamadiyu’th-Thani, I ascended to the heaven of inner meanings and presented it before His face. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered, exalted be His utterance and magnified be His majesty:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Encompassing over all who are in earth and heaven […]</p>
<p>That which was mentioned and recorded in the Books of the past and since hath been made manifest, and the divine promises shine forth like unto light. Verily, He hath fulfilled what He promised in His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. And that which the Most Exalted Pen foretold in the Land of Mystery, the Land of Secret, and the Most Great Prison hath come to pass. The croaking from the land of Kaf and Ra hath been raised, and the clamor of the idolaters is heard like the buzzing of flies behind a veil. Glory be to God! Despite the clear text of the Primal Point stating that all is limited and known by My bidding and what was revealed in the Bayan - that the entire Bayan is but a leaf among the leaves of His Paradise, and that “I am the foremost of worshippers” - yet they have objected to the Truth Himself through the words of the Bayan, like unto the people of the Furqan. They fail to perceive that the knowledge of the Bayan is today with the Truth Himself, from Whom they should seek answers. Woe unto them and unto those who heard vain imaginings on this Day wherein God hath established His firm and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>They have abandoned the Mother Book and clung to their own desires through the book of perdition. Today the Mother Book calleth out before the faces of all people: O ye that slumber, arise! O ye that are heedless, become aware! Today the world is perfumed by the breezes of the dawn of revelation and illumined by the light of His countenance. Abandon the dawning-places of vain imaginings and break the idols of idle fancies with the arm of certitude. With pure hearts, sanctified breasts, penetrating vision and radiant faces, turn ye toward the shore of the ocean of knowledge.</p>
<p>Some among the people of the Bayan utter words that no ignorant one hath ever spoken. Say: O manifestations of doubts and idle fancies, fix your gaze upon this exalted Word, which is as the spirit of inner meanings unto the world of mystic knowledge. By God’s life, it sufficeth you, were ye to know. Let your movements and your stillness, your silence and your speech be by the will of your Lord, the Commander, the All-Wise. Say: O people of the Bayan, observe this blessed Word and act according to it. Today is God’s Day; the mention of aught else is not permissible. If ye seek verses, He is the Kingdom of verses, and if ye seek proofs, He is the Dawning-Place thereof. By God’s life! The Mother Book and the Mother Bayan appeared through Him, speak through Him, and circle round Him. Today all mention and deeds are dependent upon His acceptance and good-pleasure.</p>
<p>O thou who hast dawned from the horizon of certitude! Make the heedless aware and remind them of that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, that they may adorn themselves with the greatest steadfastness and be preserved from the craft of the deceitful ones. Some among the opposers appear in the guise of friendship, concealing lethal poison in sweet and delicate words. They appear with utmost craftiness and deceit, deprived of the fragrances of divine days and forbidden from hearing His Word. In truth, they have not comprehended a single word of His utterances nor fathomed the ocean of His meanings. On God’s Day they ask about general and specific prophethood - such words testify to the baseness and heedlessness of those souls. A speaker and witness indeed! Convey greetings from this Wronged One to the friends of God who have quaffed the choice wine from the cup of the Self-Subsisting. Say: Today is the day for the manifestation of the essence of humanity. Strive that ye may succeed in performing deeds or uttering words worthy of God’s days. Ye have ever been beneath the glance of His loving-kindness[…]</p>
<p>A manifest witness unto the loved ones of God who have quaffed from the sealed wine in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Convey greetings from the Wronged One and say: Today is the day for the manifestation of the essence of humanity. Strive that ye may achieve deeds befitting the days of God, or words worthy of Him. Ye have ever been and continue to be beneath the glances of loving-kindness. Know ye the value of this most exalted station and with the utmost joy and fragrance, give utterance to the praise of the Goal of all worlds - utterance that is a consuming fire unto the opposers among the people of the Bayan and a shining light unto the people of Baha. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those whom We have guided to My straight path.</p>
<p>The world hath been encompassed by the smoke of tyranny and oppression. It is observed that each day giveth birth to a fresh evil. Goodness is like unto the phoenix, and faithfulness hath been and shall continue to be the rarest of all things. O beloved of My heart! Diverse and conflicting patterns are witnessed. One who for fifty years, more or less, hath manifested the utmost friendship and love, suddenly without cause or reason riseth up in opposition, to such an extent that no enemy or oppressor hath ever shown such enmity. Another soul who hath dwelt for years beneath the shadow of favor and repeatedly been granted permission to return to his homeland, hath disobeyed, claiming this to be from exceeding love, while outwardly possessing wealth, honor and comfort; nevertheless he hath manifested such poison and exhibited such opposition that the pen is powerless to describe it. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to illumine the world with the light of justice and deprive it not of the splendors of the sun of faithfulness. Indeed, thus must it be - both the people of the highest heaven circling round and the people of the lowest hell arising. The Cause is in God’s hands, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the beloved of the heart, His Holiness H. - upon him be all the most glorious Glory - it brought great joy. Praise be to God, the magnet of grace caused gathering in the station of truthfulness and security, and in that blessed spot ye sat and spoke and listened, for God and in God and purely for His sake. Some time ago his letter arrived and specifically a detailed and extensive Tablet was revealed from the heaven of grace and sent. God willing, he will attain unto it and be illumined by the effulgent rays of the Sun of utterance.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about his being forbidden to proceed to the lands of T. and M. and Kh., this is unquestionably true, for in those days the fire of hatred was aflame in those regions. However, should entry and arrival occur with wisdom, there is and hath been no harm. Even as was revealed by the Supreme Pen in the previous Tablet, according to the command that beloved one must also in all circumstances give precedence to wisdom and keep it in view, lest the clamor of those who have denied God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, be raised.</p>
<p>Concerning what you had written about teaching and directing attention to certain regions, this is exactly right and an issue that cannot be left unanswered, for some time ago this matter was repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur, and this servant, according to His command, wrote to some of the friends that steadfast and well-established souls should direct their attention to certain regions. The outlying areas of Fars are necessary, for in some of the cities and villages there are receptive souls, and likewise in the Land of Ya and its dependencies. However, they must proceed with the utmost wisdom, for if they become known by this name at first, the people will avoid them and the purpose will not be achieved. The same applies to the regions of Kaf and Ra. But the souls who are sent must be adorned with spiritual qualities, goodly deeds, and complete detachment. After this matter was presented, He said: “Well spoken is he who sought Me and attained My presence and My favor and My mercy.” In all cases they should consult and act accordingly.</p>
<p>The honored and beloved Amin, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, has mentioned your honor in several letters, as have friends from the land of Kha and other regions. In truth they have shown and continue to show complete sincerity and kindness toward the chosen ones of God. At this time he has turned toward the Seat of the Goal of all worlds, and after his presence, this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:</p>
<p>O servant in attendance! Write to him who bears the name of the Most Truthful, upon them both be My loving-kindness, My mercy and My grace. Tell the friends not to be saddened by the oppression of oppressors and the heedlessness of the heedless. By the life of God! The entire world before the presence of the Ancient Beauty is and has been as a handful of dust, and the clamor of all is like the buzzing of a fly compared to the Call of God. Today the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree is ablaze and the lights of His countenance are manifest and radiant. With perfect unity and harmony, they must arise to educate the peoples of the world. Death is decreed for all, and the passing and transformation of the world is evident and visible. Those souls who have attained eternal life through the breezes of the divine days and the dawning lights of the morn of inner meanings must arise in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, to quicken the people of the world and offer them the choice sealed wine that flows from the source of the Self-Subsisting Name.</p>
<p>The Supreme Pen bears witness to those upright souls who, in the days of the greatest turmoil, summoned the people to the highest horizon. The clamor of the divines and the croaking of the jurists did not prevent them nor deprive them of the fragrances of the Cause. We beseech God to inflame all through His grace and favor and guide them to the straight path.</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned to My horizon and who standeth in service to My Cause! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. By My life! I have accepted the oppression of the world, its tyranny and tribulations that God’s Cause might be exalted among His servants and the fragrance of His raiment might be diffused throughout His lands. Blessed is the seeing one who hath attained to witnessing, and the hearing one who hath been honored to hearken to the call of God, the Lord of creation, before Whom the Spirit doth cry out, while the Beloved is above His head, and the Friend is at His right, and at His left are the tribes of the Supreme Concourse, speaking and bringing glad tidings of that which hath appeared, gleamed forth, shone and brightened - that which was hidden in knowledge and concealed in the Books of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O friends of God! Beware lest the affairs of men sadden you or prevent you from the Truth. Set aside what they possess, holding fast to that which hath been sent down from God, the Mighty, the Great. Aid your Lord through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. This is what ye were commanded before and in this exalted station. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My dominion be upon you and upon them and upon those whom the hosts of the world did not weaken nor the clamor of the nations frighten in this Cause, before which all things prostrated themselves when it appeared, and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth in the most exalted Paradise: “The promise hath come and the Promised One hath appeared,” and the One Who conversed upon Sinai, Who was mentioned in the tablets of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, doth speak.</p>
<p>God, exalted be His glory, is witness and aware that this servant has not forgotten and will not forget the days of association and presence, and beseeches God to ordain that which is the cause of the expansion of the breast, the brightening of the eyes, and the illumination of the heart - and that is the gathering of the friends beneath the blessed Lote-Tree. With the generous, nothing is difficult. It is hoped that the horizon of hope will be illumined and the prayer will be answered. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>As to what was written regarding meeting with the beloved spiritual one, his honor Asad, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, and likewise the honored beloved, his honor Amin, upon him be the Glory of God, Lord of the worlds, for consultation - this matter was submitted and this most exalted word shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will, His exalted Word: “Excellent is what he intended,” for from such meetings the fragrances of love are diffused and the effulgences of the lights of oneness become manifest, “and in gathering together are signs for those who seek the face of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.” The essence of what was stated is that the attention of assured souls who are focused on wisdom to cities and villages has been and is acceptable. I beseech God to assist all to that which has been and is the cause of exalting the sovereign Word.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about his honor Fa’iz, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - this was submitted. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak: “We have ordained for him a great good in the Book and commanded him to that whereby his mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.” The world has had and has no worth, and its people no faithfulness, whether children or others, as has been and is witnessed, save whom God willeth. A deed that appears today by God’s leave and is adorned with the ornament of acceptance is better and more acceptable than a hundred thousand effects and children. The Command is in God’s hand - He doeth and decreeth as He pleaseth, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise. Praise be to God, he has been and is successful, as testified by what was revealed for him in the Scriptures and Tablets. As commanded, a brief note was written separately - it would be beloved if sent to him, as the fragrance of divine favor, kindness and bounties emanates therefrom, that his heart may rejoice through the grace of God, Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the Huquq amount of 44 tumans which was given to that beloved one to deliver and which that beloved one spent - this matter was submitted to the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and was honored with acceptance and approval. Well done to you!</p>
<p>And regarding what was previously written about nearly 100 tumans of Huquq being with some of the friends who await instruction about its receipt and remittance - this matter too was submitted. As commanded, what that beloved one has spent is agreeable and acceptable, and the remainder should either be delivered to his honor K.Z., upon him be the Glory of God, in the Green Land, or to his honor S.M., upon him be the Glory of God, in the land of Q. And if sent elsewhere it is also acceptable. Blessed are those souls who have paid the Rights of God and acted according to what is in the Book.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about his honor Aqa Mirza Mas’ud, upon him be the Glory of God, and his offering (saffron) - they had written from the land of Ha. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes that God may grant success to him and the other friends that all may arise to serve the Cause as befits it and them. The payment of Huquq is firmly established in God’s Book. For certain years its collection was forbidden, then later, in view of certain benefits and the arrangement of certain necessary matters, its collection was commanded. Verily He is the Commander, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>As mentioned has been made of souls who are adorned with the ornament of steadfastness, this matter was presented before the countenance of the Ancient King. For each name, a verse was revealed from the heaven of God’s will, that they might be blessed with the special favors of God, exalted be His glory, and be immersed in the ocean of joy. This is what God hath sent down from the kingdom of His utterance, as a token of His grace unto His servants. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O ’Ali! We have witnessed and do witness that thou hast turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon and hast quaffed the Choice Wine that was sealed, whose seal was broken by My Most Self-Subsisting Name, and hast hastened unto the Dawning-Places of remembrance out of love for God, the One, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! The Wronged One remembereth thee in this month which hath been named Ramadan by the All-Merciful, with a remembrance through which the ocean of utterance hath surged, the sun of knowledge hath shone forth, and the dove of certitude hath warbled upon the branches. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who was named Mirza Muhammad, that joy and gladness might seize him from the direction of My Most Glorious Name, in such wise that he may soar with the wings of knowledge in this atmosphere from whose rushing winds the sincere ones hear that there is none other God but He, the One, the Single, the Protector of all who are in the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! The Wronged One hath turned toward thee when the opposers rose against Him with swords of tyranny and oppression, and when the divines of the earth and its jurists turned away from Him - they who violated the Covenant of God, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>O Kazim! We have remembered thee with that which shall never lose its fragrance. To this testify the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Cities of Names, and beyond them all things, and beyond them the Tongue of God in the most exalted station.</p>
<p>The Wronged One maketh mention of him who was named Muhammad: O Shaykh! Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree beyond the Ocean of Grandeur. By God’s life! Through it every monotheist hath hastened unto God, the Creator of heaven, and every one who hath turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon, and every thirsty one unto the Kawthar of eternity, and every poor one unto the Dawning-Place of riches, and every ailing one unto the Ocean of healing, and every silent one unto the Kingdom of God’s utterance, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! That which We foretold the servants in the Kaf and Ra hath come to pass. It behooveth every one who hath turned toward God to read what We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book which hath been named “The Most Holy” by God’s will, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>O ’Aziz! Blessed art thou for God hath aided thee to recognize the ocean of His knowledge, the heaven of His wisdom, the sun of His Cause, and His Wine whose seal was broken by the finger of power.</p>
<p>And We make mention of ’Abdu’l-Husayn and counsel him and those who have believed to be steadfast and to observe that which they have been commanded by God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. And We seal these verses with thy mention. Blessed art thou and blessed is My Most Truthful Name who soared on wings of longing until he entered the Most Great Prison and visited the House and stood before the Door and heard what the Speaker of Sinai uttered and beheld what most of the servants were debarred from. We have made mention of him in the Tablets with that which the treasures of the earth cannot equal. To this testifieth He Who speaketh at this moment that there is none other God but Me, the One, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>At the end of that beloved one’s letter was seen the handwriting of His Holiness the beloved Mirza H-Y, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. Praise be to God, the letter was sealed with two seals. After reading and learning of its contents, it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and after permission was granted, it attained the honor of being heard, and a most mighty and wondrous Tablet was revealed from the heaven of Will. By command of His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of His footsteps - it was written and sent. God willing, may the people of the world perceive its fragrance and not remain deprived of this greatest bounty. Some time ago, this evanescent one sent a letter to their presence; God willing, it has arrived by now.</p>
<p>Mention was made of certain steadfast women, upon them be the Glory of God. One by one they were mentioned in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence and attained the favors of God, exalted be His glory. Blessed are they, joy be unto them, and glad tidings be unto them, for they have attained that which pure essences and sanctified hearts have sought and yearned for.</p>
<p>Some time ago His Holiness the honored and revered brother, the Hakim (R), upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, set out for that direction. Specifically for some of the aforementioned steadfast women, wondrous and exalted Tablets were revealed and sent. I beseech God that they may attain unto them and engage as befits them in the mention and praise of the Peerless Friend.</p>
<p>And regarding what was written about turning towards this direction with family, it was presented before the Face. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke: “O thou who gazest toward My horizon and standeth in service to Me! The incident in the land of Ta has somewhat affected this land as well, and certain discussions have arisen. Glory be to God! All atoms testify to the tranquility, steadfastness, justice and fairness of God’s loved ones, but the corrupt ones observe their own reflection in things. They are debarred and deprived of the ocean of divine favor and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. And apparently the authorities of that land have written to the authorities of the great city concerning this Prisoner that which was born of suspicion and fancy. Verily thy Lord knoweth that they know not. Therefore the pause of those in authority is in God’s hand, the Lord of all mankind.” End quote.</p>
<p>This evanescent one’s submission is that to those divine friends who have drunk from the Kawthar of faithfulness and are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon, I offer greetings and glorification to each one. Whenever that honored one meets with them, as proxy for this evanescent servant, remind them all of this supreme utterance which flowed from the blessed Pen of the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him. His blessed and exalted Word is: “And I have written a gem concerning His remembrance, and it is that He shall not be indicated by My indication, nor by what was mentioned in the Bayan. By the life of my Beloved and your Beloved!” If a soul were to drink a drop from the ocean of meanings of this utterance which has appeared from the Dayspring of the Will of the All-Merciful, all of the Bayan and its people would be powerless to prevent him, and he would testify with absolute certainty that the purpose of the First Call was a glad tiding from God, that those near and sincere ones might become aware and purify the path from thorns and weeds. If the divine loved ones were to preserve this all-encompassing Word upon the mirror of the heart, all the people of the Bayan would be unable to speak in their presence, let alone beyond that. It is hoped that the friends will receive blessings from your breaths and be illumined by the lamp of your utterance.</p>
<p>In further submission, let any of the kindred, both male and female, be mentioned through this servant’s representation according to what they deem worthy. Peace and glory and splendor, then spirit and majesty and praise be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of all worlds, and praise be to our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>The servant</p>
<p>15th Ramadan 1301</p>
<p>Glory be to God! After concluding, it was observed that the initial decree was not completed. Among the wondrous and exalted Tablets that were specifically revealed from the heaven of grace for his honor Ibn-i-Fa’iz and some of the noble khans - upon him and them be the glory of God - were not presented. Likewise, the mention of that beloved one’s entreaty on behalf of some of the divine loved ones was not made. In any case, this servant again ascended to the supreme height, and after attaining the presence, mention was made of the aforementioned souls who were honored to attain the grace of listening, and all were blessed through divine favor with that which diffuses the fragrance of eternity. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Mighty, the Generous</p>
<p>O Husayn! Today this blessed word was heard from the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree: “The Possessor has come and the kingdom belongs to God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.” Praise be to God, thou hast attained to the hearing of the divine call on a day when those who waited were found to be turning away, and those who hoped were heedless and veiled. The grievous and major misdeeds of the people of the world have deprived them from the most great bounty, save whom thy Lord willeth. Verily thou hast attained on this day to another Tablet and to these verses sent down from the heaven of thy Ancient Lord’s favor.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who is named Kazim and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him from this station which hath been named the heaven of this heaven in My Most Great Tablet.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Mahdi and give him the glad-tidings of what We have sent down for him in another Tablet from the verses of his Lord, and We remember him at this time with a remembrance that would move every mouldering bone.</p>
<p>O Rajab! Praise be to God, the blessed Ramadan has come to an end and Shawwal has come, calling: “O people! Seize the opportunity in the days of God and be not of the heedless ones!”</p>
<p>O Ishaq! The Lord of all horizons makes mention of thee - He through Whom appeared the decree of the Covenant on the Day of Separation - and gives thee glad-tidings through this remembrance by which God created the world and guided the peoples to His straight path.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn thy face toward him who was moved with rapture when the spheres of utterance were stirred by the breezes of thy Lord the All-Merciful’s revelation, and say: Blessed is the stranger who recognized his homeland, and the existent one who knew his Dawning-Place, and he of spirit who attained unto the Word of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O Shahvirdi! The Wronged One makes mention of thee while seated upon the Throne and calls all unto God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O son of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have mentioned every name thou didst mention with that which cannot be equaled by all the trees of the world and their fruits, nor the wealth of the rich, nor the treasuries of kings and rulers. Give thanks unto God for this bounty and counsel My servants with wisdom and utterance, lest the cawing of those who have denied the All-Merciful be raised. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon those whom thou didst mention and who have attained unto the bounty of God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! It was mentioned that the letter had been sealed with two musk seals. Praise be to God that it was blessed with a third, despite the enemies and as a bounty to the loved ones. One must reflect upon the grace and bounty of the True One, exalted be His glory. Upon the mere presence and presentation of the wondrous and exalted verses, once again they were revealed. By the life of our Lord! None can reckon His bounty. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning soul. Glory and praise, peace and the spirit of mercy be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord, our Goal and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>19th of the honored month of Shawwal, 1301</p>
<p>In these days and before, petitions arrived from the Land of Kha. Until now no reply had been sent, and in these days some exalted and holy Tablets were revealed in response to various petitions that had reached the Most Holy Court, and replies to some of the letters sent were dispatched. The purpose is to inform your honor. This evanescent one beseeches the True One to give all to drink from the ocean of His utterance and to bestow upon them a complete portion, for whosoever attaineth unto this, neither the opposition of the people of the world nor the might of nations shall prevent them from the True One, exalted be His glory. Again, glory be upon you and upon them.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Glory!</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of the heavens! Thou seest how tribulation hath encompassed Thy servants who have cast the world behind their backs, turning unto the horizon of Thy Revelation. O Lord! The banner of oppression hath been raised in such wise that the dwellers of Thy Kingdom and Thy Realm, and the inhabitants of the pavilions of Thy glory and holiness, have lamented. Such oppression hath reached a point where, night and day, the Servant hath heard the lamentation of the Supreme Pen and the sighing of Him in Whose grasp lieth the Kingdom of creation. Would that the world had ceased to exist rather than hear the wailing of the Pen that moveth between the fingers of the Will of the All-Merciful. I beseech Thee, O God of all who are in the heavens and earth, and Sovereign of all who are in the kingdom of command and creation, to ordain through this supreme calamity and great tribulation that which will cause the standards of Thy guidance to be raised in Thy lands and the banners of Thy triumph in Thy realm. Then pour forth upon Thy sincere loved ones patience from Thee and forbearance from Thy presence. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest, and verily, Thou art the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance! The Servant hath attained the choice wine of your utterance and the Kawthar of your love, whereby the thirst of my separation and the burning of my remoteness have been quenched. By Thy life! From each word of your words I have drunk that which hath expanded my heart and dilated my breast and the breasts of those who have turned unto God and clung to His luminous hem. O my Beloved and my Love! Whenever I desired to respond to that which you sent from the direction of your grace, sorrows prevented me, for I heard and saw that the Supreme Pen moved in such wise as to grieve the hearts of the chosen ones and the souls of the near ones.</p>
<p>Some time before Ridvan, the Ancient Beauty wrote with His blessed hand and recited certain verses indicating sorrows and grief, until a letter arrived from the Land of Ha containing news of the persecution of certain knights in the arena of the love of God, and a few days thereafter news arrived by telegram. He verily knoweth what befell Him at the hands of those who denied God, the Lord of the worlds. Nearly a hundred Tablets were revealed in His blessed handwriting, all mentioning those holy souls and pure spirits. I swear by the Ancient Beauty, the ocean of bounty surged in such wise that the essence of life sought the place of sacrifice, that perchance it might attain this supreme bounty and greatest favor. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! The very rocks were softened by the lamentations of those near ones, yet the people are in manifest error. I know not what hardness of heart moved them to do what they did. The Concourse on High and all who are adorned with the robe of names were bewildered by them. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid His loved ones and chosen ones to read what was revealed for the martyred victors, for by their mention hearts find rest and souls attain peace. This servant copied some of those wondrous and sublime Tablets from the Supreme Pen, and through His Holiness the Name of God M.H., upon him be all-glorious Baha, sent them to your presence. From beholding that ocean of divine favors and manifestations of heavenly bounties concerning those souls, it becomes clear and evident that until these days nothing like this hath been revealed concerning any of the chosen ones. Blessed, then blessed are they who were martyred in His path and attained unto His mention.</p>
<p>Let me know what was written regarding the two honored names, Haydar and Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. It was presented. Praise be to God, divine favors have been and continue to be with them. In these days, due to atmospheric disturbances, personal affairs, and the manifestation of dark oppression, nothing was submitted to these two honored and exalted souls. They have not been forgotten and will not be forgotten. God willing, whenever it is deemed advisable, a letter will be sent to them.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the travelers, upon them be the Glory of God, they attained the Most Holy Presence and achieved their purpose. This year, whoever came did so with permission, except for three souls, including Aqa Muhammad Isma’il who had been in the surrounding areas. For a long time, whatever petition he submitted was not accepted until he returned to Aleppo. From there he submitted a petition to the Most Great Branch, may my spirit and being be a sacrifice for the dust of His most precious footsteps, and beseeched Him, and through His intercession was summoned. In His presence, he was told that his pilgrimage was accepted and he attained the adorning grace of forgiveness, but he must also seek forgiveness from Jenab-i-Zayn, upon him be the Glory of God. However, the elevated son of Jenab-i-A?daq-i-Muqaddas, upon them both be the Glory of God, and Aqa Muhammad-’Ali from the people of Ba who was with them, had permission before and after. We beseech God to assist all to that which He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Aqa Husayn, relative of Aqa Asadu’llah from the people of N and R, it was presented. This is what the Beloved uttered in response:</p>
<p>He is the Mighty, the Beloved</p>
<p>O Husayn! The fire of tyranny and corruption has encompassed the world, and the dark smoke of heedlessness and oppression has prevented most people from turning to the Truth. The Manifestation of the Command of the All-Merciful and the Dawning-Place of the Revelation of the All-Glorious is captive in the hands of the rebellious ones. I swear by the Sun of Revelation that We eagerly seek with Our soul all the tribulations of the earth in the path of the Friend. We beseech God that pure hearts which have been illumined by the lights of the recognition of the All-Merciful Lord be not darkened and sullied by the dust of the deeds of the oppressors. Behold the world as virtually non-existent, for soon all that is observed upon it shall find its abode in the bosom of dust, even as hath been witnessed at all times. Praise the Beloved of the world Who enabled thee to turn unto Him. God willing, thou shalt at all times drink from the choice wine of steadfastness in this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>Say: O my God! Thou seest how darkness hath encompassed Thy earth by reason of what the hands of Thy tyrannical servants have wrought. I beseech Thee to transform it through the light of Thy days and the manifestation of Thy justice. O my Lord! Ordain for him who hath turned unto Thee that which shall make him steadfast upon Thy path, firm in Thy service, speaking Thy praise, and hoping for Thy bountiful grace. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And that which was sent through Jenab-i-Muhammad-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, was received.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God, when it was presented, He said: “We have hearkened to his call time after time, and occasion after occasion. Although outwardly nothing has been specifically revealed for him from the Supreme Pen in these days, yet he has been and is remembered before the Throne. All that he has endured in the path of God has been and is remembered in the presence of Him from Whose knowledge nothing escapes. The ocean of oppression has surged and the winds of tyranny have blown. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of the beginning and the end. O Zayn, reflect upon the deeds of the oppressors - they make mention of the Messenger yet kill his sons; they lament for the progeny of the Pure One yet cut out her liver. Thus have their souls made fair-seeming to them that from which Satan himself has disassociated himself. God willing, there shall flow from the Supreme Pen specifically for him that which shall endure throughout the permanence of the kingdom and the realm.”</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu-Talib, upon him be the Glory of God. After it was presented, He said: “Both before and after, mention of him has been made in the Most Holy Court, and numerous Tablets have been revealed and sent down from the heaven of divine grace. We beseech God to assist him to serve His Cause. Verily He heareth the call of him who maketh mention of Him and uttereth His praise. He is, verily, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>The mention of Jinab-i-’Ali-Asghar that was in the letter of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, upon them both be the Glory of God, wherein he had requested that they be remembered in the Most Holy Court, was presented. He showed the utmost loving-kindness towards them, saying: “During the days of his presence he attained unto countless bounties. Blessed is he and joy be unto him.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, mention of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God (in the land of N and R), was made in the Most Holy Court. A wondrous and sublime Tablet specifically for him was given to the son of Jinab-i-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God, to deliver. Likewise, this servant had previously written a letter in response to his letter which was addressed to this evanescent one. Its sending was delayed but has now been sent. Whenever appropriate, your honor may send it. Although in these days, due to the flames of the fire of oppression and tyranny, the more matters remain concealed the better. The son of Jinab-i-Asdaq, upon him be the Glory of God, must conduct himself with great wisdom, as was told to him in the presence of the Ancient Beauty. For the rest, your honor may act as deemed expedient. Verily He is the One Who has commanded all to wisdom, and His is the Command and the Creation, and for us is submission. There is no God but He, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Aqa Yusuf from the people of N and R through their honors, upon them both be the Glory of God, when it was presented to the Most Holy Court, this is what the Tongue of the Beloved uttered:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Generous […]</p>
<p>O Zayn! We make mention of those who have believed in God and His signs and have turned with radiant hearts toward His countenance, as the Lord of Names beareth witness in this glorious station. The pebble hath heard My remembrance, the earth My utterance, the mountain My call, the heaven My lamentation, and the Concourse on High My sighs. Thus do We expound for thee that thou mayest be of the thankful. Say: O Joseph! By the life of God, We make mention of thee. Verily He seeth whosoever turneth unto Him and heareth the call of him who speaketh of this mighty Cause. O Joseph! Calumny was cast upon the first Wolf, but the Wolf of the land of Sad devoured Joseph the Apostle and the son of the Virgin before the faces of the heedless. O Joseph! Reflect upon those who read the Qur’an and claim allegiance to Muhammad the Apostle of God, yet slay His sons and plunder their possessions without clear proof or manifest Book. Hold fast to the cord of grace and say: I beseech Thee, O Thou for Whose sake blood was shed and lamentations were raised, by Thy Name through which the trumpet was blown and the dwellers of the graves arose, to make me steadfast in Thy remembrance and firm in Thy praise among Thy servants in such wise that neither the might of any oppressor nor the tyranny of any denier may weaken me. Verily Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And regarding Jinab Aqa Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, the physician, and others, what you wrote was presented before the Most Holy Court. This is what the Desired One hath spoken:</p>
<p>He is the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>O Physician! Hearken unto the call from the direction of the Prison and reflect upon God’s grace and justice, and the oppression of those who claim faith for themselves yet slay the sons of the Apostle without clear proof or Book. The world hath so deluded them that they deny Him Whom they mention night and day. They have slain their men and plundered their women and children. By God’s life! They have committed that which hath caused the Spirit to lament at the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and the Beloved One in the most exalted station. It behooveth every person of insight to observe their deeds and reflect upon what they have wrought both in former times and in these days. Oppression hath reached such a state that every tongue is powerless to describe it, yet the oppressors are in joy and delight. God shall soon seize them with justice from His presence and purify the earth from the defilement of these people. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. When thou receivest My letter, give thanks unto God that thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One, Who hath sent thee that which hath diffused the fragrance of the All-Merciful throughout all regions. From this station We send greetings to thy son, that the attraction of his Lord’s verses may seize him and draw him nigh unto the Dawning-Place of inspiration.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Husayn hath been martyred in these days, and before him his brother Hasan in the path of God, the Lord of creation. Shame upon the people who have rent asunder the vitals of the Apostle while imagining themselves to be the protectors of Islam. Rejoice thou in that thou hast been mentioned by thy Lord, through Whom agitation hath seized all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, save whom God willeth, the Lord of all men.</p>
<p>Then make mention of him who is named Jamal, that he may hear the call of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Say: We have manifested Ourself for the salvation of the world, yet the peoples have turned away and united to harm Us, as testifieth He with Whom is the Mother Book. Hold fast unto the Most Great Cord, then act according to what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Tablets. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee from this Prison which hath been named with all names in the Book of God, the Cleaver of the Dawn.</p>
<p>O Pen, turn towards him who is named Abdu’r-Rahman, then mention him that his heart may rejoice and he may remain steadfast on the path. Blessed is he who hath believed in God and acted according to what He hath commanded in the Book that speaketh with truth. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is the soul that hath been adorned with My attributes; verily, such a one is of the people of Baha, as doth testify He in Whose grasp is the kingdom of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>O Zein! The Supreme Pen hath mentioned and continueth to mention both great and small among the loved ones. At all times the mention of the All-Merciful is raised, and whatsoever proceedeth therefrom to the world of creation in its primal reality returneth unto those sanctified souls who have quaffed from the sealed wine and who are fixed upon the Name of the Self-Subsisting. Blessed are they for what they have recognized and attained in these days when the wine of vain imaginings hath intoxicated most of mankind. This station hath no peer or likeness. The grace of God hath reached such a degree that He mentioneth all. The rain from the clouds of this grace hath no equal, nor will it ever have; yet sight, hearing, and understanding are lacking. As thou dost witness, One Who hath manifested all the divine proofs, evidences, and verses that exist in the world among the peoples - yet they do not acknowledge belief in Him, much less in that which is above Him. The Tree is raised with utmost grace, yet observe how on all its twigs and branches are seen the marks of the swords and stones of the polytheists and the hateful ones. Nevertheless, at every moment it calleth the people to the supreme horizon with its most exalted call. We desire to end Our utterance at this time and say: All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Likewise doth the Supreme Pen mention Ali, that he may be gladdened by the choice wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful, remain occupied with His remembrance and steadfast in His Cause. Convey My glory unto his face and give him the glad-tidings of My mention of him, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. And mention was made of a handmaiden of God. We make mention of her as a grace from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Blessed is the handmaiden who hath attained unto the Most Great Steadfastness. She is assuredly among the people of Paradise in a glorious Book. We have made mention of every servant who hath turned and every handmaiden who hath turned unto God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to aid her and strengthen her in His remembrance and praise. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the Tablets of Dervish Baqir, by command they should remain with thee. And concerning what thou didst write about the prayer beads: Several years ago, one of the friends found a silver belt, and after it was presented before the Most Holy Court, they commanded in the name of bounty - 95 (Baha’u’llah) - that a herald should announce it in the streets and markets for one day so that its owner might be found, and if after the announcement the owner was not found, to wait nineteen days and then take possession of it. Nevertheless, when this was submitted, They said that the friends of this Revelation have been commanded to observe the Most Great Trustworthiness; their eyes and hearts must be sanctified and purified from worthless, transient possessions belonging to others. In this year and the previous year, countless verses have been revealed from the heaven of God’s command. Blessed is the eye that seeth and the soul that knoweth and acteth, and woe unto those who forsake and turn away. And in place of those prayer beads, We have sent one set of prayer beads that her supposition may attain to the station of certitude and she may be gladdened by God’s grace. Blessed is she before God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O thou who art adorned with the love of the Beloved of the world! In the Ridvan He appeared with utmost sorrow, and the radiance of that sorrow was reflected upon you. Blessed art thou and blessed am I; joyous art thou and joyous am I. Rejoice and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds! Hadst thou been present before the Throne and heard the lamentation of My Most Exalted Pen at the time of revelation, thou wouldst have wept with the weeping of the bereft and been counted among those who have lost.</p>
<p>Thus far is the answer to the blessed letter written on the 17th of Muharram. And then thy letter dated the first of Safar illumined the star of the heart with the lights of the Sun of bounty, and bestowed upon the drop of knowledge the expression of an ocean. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory and might, that this supreme blessing be not withheld and this mighty gift be not delayed. The command is in His hand; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Ismu’l-Kamal, upon him be the Glory of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, his mention hath been made in the presence of the Countenance, and that which he sent was presented before the Throne. The servant sendeth greetings from this station upon him and upon those with him, and upon his family, both men and women. Blessed are they in that they have attained, acknowledged and confessed that which the Lord of the Invoked One hath uttered.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about Khwajih ’Abdu’l-Ahad, it was presented. These wondrous and sublime words were revealed from the heaven of Will specifically for him, but they must be given according to the requirements of the time, for in these days the incident in the Land of Sad hath caused agitation. In any case, the loved ones must act with the utmost wisdom. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>He is the One Who descendeth with His mighty glory.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things and in Whose right hand is the kingdom of all existence! I beseech Thee to ordain for every one who hath turned unto Thee the Kawthar of Thy presence and the wine of reunion with Thee, and to make him aware of that which beseemeth Thy Revelation, Thy greatness and Thy days. O my Lord! Illumine my sight that I may behold Thee established upon the throne of Thy power and elevated above Thy creation and creatures. O my Lord! I have turned toward the ocean of Thy bounty and the ark of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity and Thy sovereignty not to deprive me of them. Thou art He to Whose exaltation and power all atoms testify, and to Whose transcendence and ascendancy all beings bear witness. O my Lord! Grant me from the wonders of Thy generosity that which will cause me to gaze in all conditions toward Thy horizon, to stand firm in Thy Cause, and to cling to Thy robe. Thou art He from Whose knowledge nothing escapeth. Thou knowest and seest my poverty and Thy wealth, my powerlessness and Thy might. Have mercy upon me through Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>As for what your honor mentioned regarding Nabil the traveler and his son, upon them be 966 [Baha’u’llah], it was presented. He said that divine favors have been and will be, God willing, bestowed upon him and his relatives. A Tablet was sent specifically for them with the son of Janab-i-A?daq, upon them be 966 [Baha’u’llah], and likewise previously, and We mention his son at this time as a favor from Us, and verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>He is the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>The Bird of the Divine Throne hath taken flight because of the croaking of the raven. Verily thy Lord is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing. O Muhammad-Rida! We make mention of thee in this station that thou mayest rejoice in this remembrance whereby the ocean of faith hath surged and the fragrance of thy Lord’s mercy, the Lord of all religions, hath been wafted abroad. Beware lest anything whatsoever debar thee from God, the Creator of names. By My life! All the treasures of earth cannot equal one word of thy Lord. He Who hath manifested the kingdom of utterance in the realm of creation beareth witness to this. Although sorrows have encompassed all things, yet doth the All-Merciful call out with His most exalted voice: “There is none other God but He, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.” Nothing whatsoever can withhold Him from that which He desireth. He ordaineth as He pleaseth through His sovereign might. He is, in truth, the One, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>The oppressors have slain the descendants of the Apostle, yet make mention of Him at morn and eventide. The kingdom of earth and heaven is bewildered at their deeds. Erelong shall the blasts of chastisement seize them from every direction. He shall seize them even as He seized those who preceded them. Behold them who confined Us to the most desolate of lands. Blessed is he who readeth the Tablet of Ra’is and learneth of that which flowed from the Most Exalted Pen when it was captive in the hands of the wicked. The glory rest upon thee, upon thy father, and upon those who have laid hold on the hem of grace and have acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged, both in the beginning and in the end.</p>
<p>O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from His Most Great Prison. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. We have desired to make mention of the Glorious One who hath ascended unto God, the Lord of the worlds. By thy life, O Zayn! He attained Our presence in the land of Kaf, and We cast upon him the Word of God, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The fire of the Word so seized him that he was drawn to the Most Sublime Horizon. The Lord of Names in this glorious station beareth witness unto this. We testify that he believed in Me and acknowledged that which God acknowledged on the day when men turned away from God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. He bore witness as We bore witness when the Trump was blown and all who are in the heavens and earth swooned away, save those whom God willed to exempt, the True Sovereign, the Manifest. Blessed is he who remembereth him as recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in this wondrous Tablet.</p>
<p>The Tongue of Grandeur maketh mention of him in this station and saith: “Blessed art thou who hast laid hold on the Most Great Handle and clung to the hem of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Merciful.” I testify that thou art a servant who hath believed in God, the Manifestations of His Revelation, the Dawning-Places of His inspiration, and the Recipients of His imperative command, the All-Compelling, the Most Great. Thou art he who hath borne hardships in the path of God, and tribulation and adversity have touched thee in this straight Path.</p>
<p>Then We make mention of his son, Al-Wahhab, who was set ablaze with the fire of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He is the one who was martyred in the path of God. The Concourse on High and those who circle round His exalted throne bear witness unto this. Blessed is he who maketh mention of them both, who visiteth them, and who through them draweth nigh unto God, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>He is the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Zein! We wish to make mention of thy son who ascended unto Us, attained Our presence, drank the choice wine of Our revelation, and immersed himself in the ocean of Our mercy which hath preceded all worlds. Blessed art thou, O son, in that thou wast in a house wherein was raised the remembrance and praise of God. This indeed is a great bounty. Thou art he upon whom We shed the lights of beauty, whereupon thou didst sacrifice thy spirit for God, the One, the All-Informed. We, verily, visit thee, O son, from this station and say: Upon thee be the glory of God, the glory of the Concourse on High, My remembrance and the remembrance of those who circle round the pavilion of grandeur. O thou who didst drink the milk of faith from thy mother’s breast and the Kawthar of exposition from thy father’s hand - he who arose to serve this wronged and lonely One. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur, and there hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which hath diffused the fragrance of the garment amongst the worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning the inquiry about the blessed verse of the Most Holy Book, His word, exalted be His glory: “We have appointed the two signs for the coming of age of the world” to the end of His word, exalted and mighty is He - the inability to bear sovereignty mentioned in one of the Tablets is different from the two matters revealed in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while this servant was engaged in writing this petition to your presence, they commanded: Write to Zein, upon him be the Glory of God, that the delay in your reply was due to the gathering of travelers, but you should not be saddened, for whenever a reply is revealed, it is and will be nourishing and enriching, as each portion of the reply descends from the heaven of grace and is dispatched. Happy art thou!</p>
<p>Among others, the honored Aqa Siyyid ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God, set forth with numerous replies to petitions, and likewise Aqa Muhammad from the people of Qaf, and the honored Ibn-i-Asdaq and those with him, upon them be the Glory of God. It is known how many Tablets they carried, and likewise those souls who proceeded with permission, including Shaykh Salman. The purpose of mentioning this is that most times delays occur due to this servant’s lack of time. In all cases, forgiveness is hoped for.</p>
<p>Another submission is that the honored Ustad ’Abdu’l-Ghani, upon him be the Glory of God, was with this servant in the small plot known as the large one, and this servant recalled your statement written previously expressing your wish to be present and attain to service. In view of that statement, this servant specifically mentioned to Ustad ’Abdu’l-Ghani that today you should engage in service to the small plot on behalf of Zein, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory of God, and he truly engaged in service that day with complete joy and delight like a skilled worker. He himself will submit the details.</p>
<p>Regarding what you had written about the honored Ism-i-Nasr, upon him be the Glory of God, it was submitted. They said: Divine favors have been bestowed upon him. God willing, may he be confirmed and assisted in the mention and praise of Truth and be adorned with the ornament of justice. O Zein! In these days the temple of justice hath fallen into the hands of the manifestations of tyranny, as thou hast heard and continues to hear. Ask God, thy Lord, to deliver it and to transform the seat of oppression into the throne of justice. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>The honored Ism-i-Nasr has requested Tablets specifically for certain accepted souls. Should God will, We shall send them as a bounty from His presence. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>Another submission is that at the time of the departure of Jenab-i-Ibn-i-Asdaq, upon them both be the Glory of God, nothing was revealed from the heaven of bounty specifically for the known person who is in the land of Kha. However, in response to the request of the aforementioned one, They made a promise, and therefore the Most Holy, Most Mighty Tablet was revealed specifically for them and was sent. If they honor that land with their presence, give it to them to deliver, and this matter must, according to the command, remain confidential and reach the known person in sealed form. And this too, if the time is appropriate, for They have said that at certain times some souls are observed to be fearful of certain events. Therefore, consideration of timing is necessary, and furthermore, the known souls have been and are being watched by the enemies who await an occurrence to arise that they might proclaim it. In this case, the protection of known souls is necessary. Blessed are they who conceal and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Another submission of this evanescent one is that you should convey the Most Glorious, Most Mighty, Most Wondrous greetings from this servant to all the friends of God who reside in that land, whether they be the captives of God or others. The Glory be upon your honor and upon them and upon His trustees and His loved ones and His friends in every direction of all directions.</p>

<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs and caused the Mother Book to speak at the final return, whereby the mysteries were revealed and rivers flowed from rocks, and through which the Crimson Ark sailed upon the sea of names, and from the clouds of proof rained down the showers of wisdom and utterance. He it is Who hath made manifest what was hidden in knowledge and treasured within the shell of His Command, and through Him the Dove of Knowledge warbled upon the highest branches. There is no God but Him; He hath ever been sanctified beyond the mention of all created things and exalted above the comprehension of the dwellers of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Thou knowest and seest that one of Thy servants, who was named Yahya, left his homeland, seeking that which he desired, and crossed land and sea until he reached the great city that was known among the people as ’Aliyyih. He tarried there some days and associated with both those who accepted and those who turned away, until the appointed time was fulfilled. Then he set out for the place called Cyprus in the visible world, where he associated with those who sought him and asked of him what they asked, and he answered in ways unfit to be mentioned in the cities of knowledge and wisdom and before the presence of those who have turned to Thy countenance in days when the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted among all possibilities. He remained with him for numbered days, and when he departed, he sought the ultimate goal, the supreme summit, and the furthest end, approaching and advancing until he entered the Most Great Prison, which Thou hadst made a dwelling place for those who had migrated in Thy path, turned to Thy horizon, spoken Thy praise, and arose to serve Thy Cause.</p>
<p>He attained the presence of the Face and heard from the Self of the Manifestation and the Speaker of the Mount that which the son of ’Imran heard on the Mount of Thy knowledge. Thou didst shine upon him with a light from the lights of Thy throne, that he might draw nigh unto Thy court and enter beneath the shade of the pavilions of Thy grace and favor. O Lord! Thou seest the stranger seeking his supreme homeland in the vicinity of Thy mercy, the thirsty one yearning for the Kawthar of Thy bounty, the poor one desiring the ocean of Thy riches, the sick one longing for the Salsabil of Thy healing, the distant one reaching for the Tasnim of Thy nearness, the sinful one hoping for the dewdrops of Thy forgiveness, and the weary one seeking the kingdom of Thy utterance.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest him who hath stood before the door which Thou hast opened by Thy power and sovereignty unto all in Thy earth and Thy heaven, that he might hear Thy sweetest call and behold Thy most exalted horizon. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast manifested Thy Cause and Thy sovereignty, and by the power of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and the potency of Thy most sublime Word, and the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, and the manifestations of Thy grandeur, O Lord of all humanity and King of the throne on high and of the dust below, that Thou assist him to be fair in Thy Cause, then enable him to rend asunder the veils of idle fancies that have come between him and Thee and prevented him from drawing nigh unto Thee and beholding the lights of Thy countenance, that he may see Thee with Thine own eyes, not with the eyes of Thy servants, and hear with his own ear, not with the ears of those in Thy lands.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou knowest him better than I. If Thou seest in him turning to Thee and facing toward Thy direction and holding fast to Thy cord, aid him through Thy bounty and bestowals and gifts, that he may know Thee through Thee and be severed from all else besides Thee, to such extent that he may arise among Thy servants, remind them of Thy signs, and support Thee in such wise that neither the veils of the world nor the might of nations shall hold him back. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest, and by Thy Name Thou hast raised the banner of “He doeth what He willeth.” There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the Dominant, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O thou who hast entered the prison and attained the presence of the Countenance! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. By God’s life, verily he whom the servants have taken unto themselves as a guardian or executor or mirror or above or below that – We did nurture him and protect him from his earliest days until one among the servants led him astray to harm Me and shed My blood. To this do testify the servants who surround Me and beyond them those among His creation whom We fed. When that which was hidden in his breast and concealed in his heart was revealed, he raised an outcry, clinging to calumnies that hold no weight with God, the Commander, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus did his soul prompt him to commit a grievous wrong, and he became one of the transgressors.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning Him Who shall appear and Who shall be known by none other: They who are endowed with insight from God behold Him and testify that He hath come from the heaven of grandeur and power with the hosts of revelation and inspiration. Whoso denieth Him hath denied God from time immemorial, and whoso acknowledgeth and recognizeth Him hath borne witness to God and His signs and His manifestations from the Beginning that hath no beginning unto the End that hath no end. We counsel thee with a word which the people of the cities of knowledge, mystical understanding, justice and fairness will verify: Turn not unto that which those servants have uttered who have broken God’s covenant and His testament, who have denied His signs and disputed His proof. Look with thine own eyes upon the Tree and its fruits, the Sun and its radiance, the Ocean and its waves, and the Light and its effulgence. By God’s life, We have brought forth from the treasuries of the Supreme Pen the pearls of wisdom and utterance, yet the people are in evident doubt. Say: Fear ye God! This is the Day whereof God’s Books and His Messengers gave glad-tidings, the Day whereon God took His covenant from every Prophet and every trustworthy one, and whose mention hath adorned the pages of the Book of existence, if ye be of them that know. Beware lest ye trouble the pure Salsabil of mystic knowledge with what exists in the contingent world. Purify your ears through the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, that ye may hearken to the rustling of My Tree, the murmuring of the water of My bounty, the whisper of the winds of My grace, the cooing of the doves of My Cause, and the melodies of the nightingales of My remembrance. Say: By God, ye were created to hearken unto the Word of God, the Lord of the Throne and the Lord of the exalted Seat!</p>
<p>O Yahya! Hear the call from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, raised up on the white earth at the right hand of the luminous Spot: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Yahya! Know thou with the knowledge of certainty that He about Whom thou hast asked cannot be indicated by any indication, nor described by any description, nor comprehended by any comprehension. By God! The comprehensions of the world cannot encompass Him, nor can He be mentioned by that which existeth among the nations. He it is Who speaketh and calleth out, yet most of the people are as dead. He was seated before thy face and speaking with thee. Recognize thou this most exalted station and say […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O God of Names! Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord of creation and King of earth and heaven! I testify that Thou art the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. Thou hast manifested Thyself and opened wide the gate of utterance and meaning to all who dwell in the realm of being. Blessed the servant who hath inhaled Thy fragrance and the sweet-scented breezes of Thy Revelation, and turned toward Thy horizon after the Daystar of Thy leave had dawned. Woe betide him who hath denied Thee. I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy signs and the heaven of Thy clear tokens to aid Thy servants to attain the presence of Thy throne, to hearken unto Thy sweetest call, and to behold Thy most exalted horizon. O Lord! Deprive them not of the wonders of Thy grace. Draw them nigh unto Thee through Thy bounty and loving-kindness. Though Thy irrevocable decree and ordained command may prevent them, inscribe for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen the reward of Thy presence and the recompense of those who circle round Thee and quaff the choice wine of reunion with Thee. Thou art He Who with the movement of Thy finger rent asunder the veils and by the power of Thy Pen dispelled the clouds. There is no God but Thee, the Strong, the All-Conquering, the Almighty.</p>
<p>O Yahya! Behold and then make mention of that which the tongue of My Herald uttered concerning Me. Indeed, I have written a precious word regarding him, namely that none should be known through My allusion nor through what was mentioned in the Bayan. By God’s life! This word guideth the fair-minded to the Most Exalted Horizon and them that are nigh unto the Lord of Names. Blessed is he who hath inhaled its fragrance and held fast unto its cord. Where are the fair-minded among the divines and jurisprudents? And where are they whom doubts have not withheld from the Lord of Names and Attributes? And where are they whom the veils of earth and its delights, riches and colors have not debarred? O Yahya! By God! This is the Day whereof God gave glad tidings to His Beloved through His words “the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds,” and whereof He gave tidings to Moses, saying “Lead forth thy people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God,” and in another place “and thy Lord shall come with angels rank on rank.” This is the Day wherein the All-Knowing hath come in the shadows of clouds. This is the Day wherein the smoke hath encompassed the dwellers of earth and the cities of names. Were We to recount for thee what the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Qur’an and in previous Books, thou wouldst abandon what the people possess, clinging to this momentous Announcement which hath made the limbs of the idolaters to quake and the hearts of the deniers to tremble - they who cast the Most Great Ocean behind their backs, hastening toward the mere pool. By God! The Cause is mighty, mighty, and the Day mighty, mighty. Whenever the Luminary of utterance dawneth from the horizon of the heaven of My Most Exalted Pen, the Kingdom of Remembrance and Praise is stirred with rapture by the sweetness of the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! By God, ye were created for this Day. Fear God, and exchange not the grace of God for denial, and be not of the wrongdoers. Behold the Tablet and what shineth from its horizon. It guideth you unto His straight path and acquainteth you with that which ye were prevented from knowing today. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Cast aside the sayings of men that ye may hear the call of the Lord of creation. Abandon vain imaginings that the Word may draw you to the Dayspring of certitude. The Wronged One proclaimeth in loudest voice: The Lord of Eternity is come in His Most Great Name, and through Him the gate of the Divine Presence hath been opened before all who are in earth and heaven. All things have proclaimed: The Kingdom and Dominion, and Glory and Might belong unto God, the One, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O Yahya! When thou hast been blessed to hearken unto My call and hast beheld the pearls of the ocean of My knowledge and the lights of the Sun of My utterance, go forth unto My loved ones and give them the glad-tidings of the heaven of My bounty and the stars of My favors and that which thou hast heard from the Kingdom of My wondrous utterance. We have sent down that before which the verses have bowed down in submission and have revealed that by which the hearts of them that are nigh have been attracted. Say: O people of the Bayan! Deal fairly by your Lord, the All-Merciful. If ye deny this Most Great Announcement, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Fear God and be not of the heedless. This is the station wherein the Primal Point, upon mention of His Name, declared: “I am the first to worship Him.” When one of His Letters inquired of Him concerning Me, He banished him with the whips of His utterance and threatened him, saying: “Were it not that thou art of the First Unity, I would have decreed for thee a punishment in the Book of God, the Sovereign, the Just, the All-Wise.” If thou wouldst read what the Point revealed in this station upon mention of My Name, thou wouldst forsake the world behind thee and cry out among the people with this wise Remembrance, and arise to serve My Cause in such wise that neither the hosts of the world would frighten thee nor the power of the monarchs weaken thee. We revealed aforetime unto one of the servants: “This is not the Day for questions. It behooveth every soul, when he heareth the Call from the Supreme Horizon, to arise and say: ‘Here am I, O Desire of the world! Here am I, O Worshipped One of all who are in the heavens and on earth!’” Wouldst thou question Him Whose mercy hath preceded all things, Whose grace hath encompassed all, Whose lights have shone forth, Whose manifestations have dawned, Whose proof hath been sent down, Whose evidence hath appeared, and Who hath ever stood before the faces of all in the realm of possibility? Art thou come or wilt thou come? Say: Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I turn unto Thee, and I am the first of them that turn. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I am of them that bow down. Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! I am of them that worship. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge and the stars of the heaven of Thy wisdom, and by the lights of Thy countenance and the mysteries of Thy Book, that Thou forgive me and have mercy upon me. By Thy glory, O my God! My transgressions have prevented me from drawing nigh unto Thee, and my sins have intervened between me and Thee. I acknowledge and confess before Thy face that Thou didst create me for the knowledge of Thyself and for hearkening unto Thy call and for beholding the lights of Thy horizon. By Thy glory! Whenever I reflect upon my hesitation and heedlessness, my liver melteth, my heart is set aflame, and my soul is overturned; and whenever I reflect upon the ocean of Thy mercy and the heaven of Thy bounty and generosity, my soul is assured, my heart findeth rest, and my agitation is stilled. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy path, admitted me into Thy presence, and made me know the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation, the Source of Thy Cause, and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee to aid me to acknowledge that which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy will. Then I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, by the breezes of Thy verses, and by the lands that have been honored by Thy footsteps, and by the cities wherein Thy call was raised, and by the spot whereon the throne of Thy grandeur was established, to make me in all conditions detached from all else save Thee, holding fast unto Thee, and clinging to the hem of the robe of Thy grace. Then aid me, O my God, to remember Thee in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall prevent me from extolling Thee among Thy creation. Verily Thou art the Almighty, unto Whose might all created things have testified, and all contingent beings to Thy greatness and sovereignty. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Yahya! Call to mind when thou didst appear before the Divine Throne in bygone days, and with thee was he who was named ’Ali in the Book of Names. We made mention to thee of that which thou hadst asked, unveiled the truth unto thee, and caused thee to hear the warbling of the Bird of Utterance upon the loftiest branches, that thou mightest know that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken. By the life of God! We desired naught save to deliver thee from the ocean of idle fancies and to awaken thee in these days wherein slumber hath overtaken the dwellers of the cities of ignorance and transgression. I bear witness before God, and the Daysprings of His Revelation, and the Dawning-Places of His inspiration, and the Manifestations of His Self, and the Treasuries of His wisdom, that I desired for thee naught save that which hath been sent down in His perspicuous and binding Book. Beware lest the veils of idle fancy withhold thee, or doubts and allusions debar thee, even as they have debarred people before thee. Observe, then call to mind the people of former times and that which prevented them from turning unto the supreme horizon, the ultimate station, and the highest summit. Beware, beware lest thou deprive thyself of the outpourings of thy Lord’s days and of that which hath been sent down from the heaven of knowledge and wisdom upon His servants and His creatures. Cast aside thy vain imaginings. By God! The Sun of Inspiration hath dawned from the horizon of thy Lord’s will, the Lord of this wondrous Day. We have caused thee to hear the melodies of the birds of wisdom and knowledge in the eloquent tongue, and We desire to cause thee to hear them in a perspicuous Persian tongue, that thou mayest know and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Hearken in the Persian tongue to the call of the Wronged One. He, verily, draweth thee nigh and aideth thee as a grace from His presence, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Generous. I swear by the Sun of the heaven of inner meanings which hath shone forth from the most exalted horizon of the world: this Wronged One hath had no purpose except the edification of the world, the education of the nations, the refinement of souls, and the unification of hearts. His intention is to cleanse the world through the waters of remembrance and utterance from rancor and hatred, that perchance religious strife and conflict, which are the cause and reason for the shedding of blood and the upheaval of the world of humanity, might be removed from its midst, so that all who dwell on earth might be adorned with the ornament of unity and concord and illumined with the light of love and harmony. To the extent possible, nay beyond it, hath the Most Exalted Pen counseled the people, and It hath had no helper save the Pen itself. To this beareth witness every fair-minded and insightful one, and every learned and informed one. Observe the religions of the world, how they remain veiled and debarred. Glory be to God! All await the divine days, and in the nights and days they implore and supplicate with the utmost humility and devotion for the meeting with the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Nevertheless, when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of the world, all remained occupied with their own idle fancies and devoted to the idols of their own selves. They have forsaken the Truth and clung to that which is unseemly. We beseech God to aid all and not to deprive them of the Kawthar of awareness. He is, verily, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Yahya! Behold with thine own eyes what hath been revealed by the Most Exalted Pen. Thus doth He say: “Whoso desireth to know Him, let him look upon Him with his own eyes.” Today the Truth is known by His own Self, not by the Bayan and what hath been revealed therein, even as the Primal Point hath testified to this truth. This is specially true of this Most Great Revelation. Should anyone seek to adduce proofs from the Bayan, he would find himself deprived of the straight path. This is the testimony which the Point of the Bayan Himself hath borne, saying: “He shall not be known through My tokens nor through that which hath been revealed in the Bayan.” Although the entire Bayan was revealed to establish this Most Great Cause and Mighty Announcement, He saith: “Beware, beware lest thou be veiled by the Vahid of the Bayan, for that Vahid was created by Him. Beware, beware lest thou be veiled by what was revealed in the Bayan.” He proclaimeth with the loudest voice that the Sovereign of Revelation, the Speaker of Sinai, shall not be known through His tokens nor through the Bayan and what was revealed therein. This Most Great Revelation encompasseth all things and is not encompassed. Now hath the Light of Light shone forth and that which was hidden is revealed in this Unfurled Scroll. Thereafter neither lamp, nor moon, nor sun shall profit thee. Ponder that thou mayest find the purpose of God and be of them that are firmly established in this Manifest Cause.</p>
<p>Would that the deluded ones had clung to the lamp! By the life of God, they cling to the source of vain imaginings and perceive it not. If they seek verses, these have encompassed the world. If they desire proofs, all that hath subsequently appeared was revealed aforetime with utmost clarity by the Most Exalted Pen. If they seek outward power and might, all have testified and do testify that this Wronged One hath, from the earliest days, openly and without any veil, summoned all people, whether rulers, ministers, divines or jurisprudents, to the Most Sublime Horizon with the loudest call. He that hath vision beholdeth the Tree itself and its fruits, and likewise the sun and its rays. This Wronged One hath not proved His Cause through verses alone, but through all that hath proceeded from Him. The Point of the Bayan hath testified to this, saying that whatsoever proceedeth from Him is the criterion. In days when the whole world trembled before the might of the oppressors and tyrants, We arose to champion the Cause through divine power - an uprising that knew no sitting, and We raised a call that knew no silence.</p>
<p>Consider the Persian Bayan and likewise all the writings of the Point. Although the deniers have forsaken the Bayan and its Author and are occupied with the vain imaginings of the former peoples, they say the Bayan hath been corrupted. God slay them! God slay them! Say: O ye who are devoid of fairness! For a thousand and two hundred years and more hath the Shi’ih sect clung to such vain imaginings. What was its fruit and what was its result? Yea, the result was that all the divines and jurisprudents in the early years rose up against the Sovereign of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen, and ultimately issued the decree for the shedding of His most pure blood. Now too are the deniers of the Bayan engaged in forming such a sect. Say: Fear ye God! Place yourselves in His presence, then judge with fairness concerning this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of all horizons, and this Sun whose rays have encompassed all regions. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. The Truth regardeth all deeds […]</p>
<p>Be not among the wrongdoers. Be distinguished from all others by the truth of your deeds and actions. Hearken unto the counsel of Him Who is wronged, and turn from that which ye possess to that which God possesseth. The ear was created for this Day, and sight was brought into being for this Day. It is hoped that the people of God will arise to aid His Cause and conquer the cities of hearts through the hosts of deeds and character in the name of the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>O Yahya! Should anyone attain unto this most exalted Word, which adorns the preface of the Book of Grace, he shall find himself steadfast and at peace. Put aside today what the people possess, and hold fast to that which thou hast been given from God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. This Day is God’s Day, wherein none but Him is mentioned. Consider the baseness in the nature of those who have turned away from the Bayan. They speak anew of the Mirror, the Successor, the Guardian, the Chief, and the Noble One. Today none but God is mentioned and none but He exists. One marvels how these people wander in the wilderness of polytheism while counting themselves among the monotheists, and roam in the valley of ignorance while considering themselves people of knowledge.</p>
<p>Some have clung to Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest while remaining deprived of His Lord. Say: O ye who lack justice! He hath said that whenever He appears, all must acknowledge Him and render thanks unto God. None but Him hath known, nor knoweth. Hear what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Alif. Lam. Mim. Do men think that they will be left alone on saying, ‘We believe,’ and that they will not be tested?” Through a single word - ‘Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest’ - He tested all, though He had said that if ye hear of such a matter and do not believe, commit not that which would cause Him grief, even if it should be other than Him - though this supposition is impossible. Yet merely because He mentioned the name, it behooveth those who love Him not to cause Him sorrow, out of respect for His name.</p>
<p>Now the deniers of the Bayan demand the equivalent of all previous and subsequent books, and more besides, that perchance the fire of hatred and animosity might be quenched and the sun of justice might shine from the horizon of the heaven of their hearts. Have not the tribulations We have endured from the beginning until now sufficed? The sun, moon, stars, heaven, trees, and fruits all bear witness that this Wronged One hath not for a moment sought to protect Himself. At times beneath chains and fetters, at times captive in the hands of the wicked. God knoweth what hath befallen Me in His path.</p>
<p>Some have said this Most Great Manifestation and Mighty Announcement hath appeared too soon. Say: O ignorant ones! The Point of the Bayan hath said, “If He should appear at this very moment, I would be the first to fall down before Him.” What say ye concerning the words “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth”? By God! Had they attained unto a single drop from the ocean of meanings contained within this most exalted Word, they would not have hesitated for a moment. O Yahya! This most exalted Word is the greatest stronghold for the servants. Whosoever reacheth it and attaineth unto it shall find himself seated upon the throne of steadfastness and assurance. Blessed is he who hath attained, and woe unto every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>Say: Reflect upon the Son of Zacharias and the Son of Mary, who appeared in the same age. Say: Fear God, and be not among the deniers. Had the Point of the Bayan not beheld the very Manifestation Himself, He would never have caused these words to flow from His Pen: “If ye hear that One hath appeared, deny Him not.”</p>
<p>Be not among the deniers. Had the Point of the Bayan not beheld this Revelation in person, never would it have flowed from His Pen. Should you hear that One hath appeared, deny Him not, and tarry not even to say “yea.” Today verses are raining down like showers from the clouds of divine Will, and have encompassed all eyes and hearts. Blessed is he who denieth not that which shineth forth clear as the sun, who gazeth with justice and speaketh with fairness.</p>
<p>As to thy question concerning “Him Whom God shall make manifest,” it was previously mentioned that all were tested by this word, but henceforth He declareth that whenever He appeareth, all must acknowledge Him and render thanks unto God. At the beginning of the Bayan, We commanded thee to observe the Tree and its fruits, the Sun and its rays. If thou attainest unto this station, thou hast attained unto all good. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this exalted station and the Mother of the Bayan from this luminous horizon.</p>
<p>Now, a Book hath been sent down before thy face, specially for thee, equal to all the divine Books of the past and present, yet thou remainest hesitant and perplexed. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, and turn from the north of doubt to the south of certitude. Cross over the river of names and make for the ocean of inner meanings, and from the pond proceed to the Merciful’s river of grace. Today all books are contingent upon acceptance. The Cause is another Cause, the Bayan another Bayan, and this Day another Day. If thou wouldst truly perceive each letter of the Letters of the Bayan, thou wouldst find naught but the fragrance of this Revelation. To this beareth witness He with Whom is the Mother Book. We beseech God to aid thee and illumine thee with the lights of true unity, that thou mayest pass beyond all things and turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon.</p>
<p>Judge thou by God! What became of those verses revealed concerning the advent of the Day of Resurrection - mention of the Bridge, the Balance, the rising of the dead from their graves, the blowing of the trumpet, the passing of mountains like clouds, the cleaving of heaven, the rending of earth, the descent of angels, Paradise and Hell, and the like? And what didst thou witness? And how dost thou interpret that which was revealed in the Book of God regarding the conditions of the appearance of the Resurrection? For outwardly none of these things appeared. Yet We bear witness that all have been made manifest, and the appearance of these matters hath been dependent upon the Word of God, exalted be His glory. For each of these there are meanings ordained and recorded with God. The raising up of places, in its primary sense, hath been and is through the Word of God. Should He say “The places are raised up,” through this word it would be evident and manifest to those possessed of vision and the Most Sublime Vision. Every matter, in its first station, its manifestation and elevation is through the Word. Hearken unto that which the Primal Point uttered in His Tablet to Mulla ’Ali-i-Bastami - may the Most Glorious Beauty of God rest upon him - which was specifically revealed for Shaykh Muhammad-Hasan-i-Najafi. When he paid no heed to that Tablet, another was revealed wherein this exalted Word was recorded: “Verily We raised ’Ali from his resting-place and sent him unto thee. Hadst thou recognized him, thou wouldst have prostrated thyself before him.” He saith: “We raised ’Ali from his resting-place and sent him unto thee. Hadst thou recognized him, thou wouldst have prostrated thyself before him. But thou didst not recognize him and all thy deeds were rendered null.” Ponder thou upon this utterance of the Point, when at the time of His manifestation He declared: “The Day whose span was fifty thousand years hath passed.” Reflect upon this most exalted Word, observe silence, and say: “I have submitted myself unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world, and I have believed in Thee, O Thou the Beloved of the hearts of them that know.” Should anyone cling to these outward conditions in their literal sense, he shall never attain to the light of faith. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, turn with thine own eyes toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and with thine own ears hear the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. Thus hath the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen been raised, and the murmuring of the Euphrates of My mercy in the realm of creation. Turn thou away from the world and all that is therein, and be not of the patient ones. Say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Mother Book which is established upon the throne in the ultimate end, and which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place of Thy verses, the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Source of Thy Cause, to strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy love in such wise that what the people possess shall never prevent me. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy direction and setting my face toward Thy countenance. All praise be unto Thee for having enabled me and strengthened me to attain unto the presence before the seat of Thy power. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy throne, the breaths of Thy revelation and the mysteries of Thy Book, to withhold me not from that which lieth with Thee. O Lord! Purify my heart with the water of Thy knowledge and increase the light of my vision through Thy bounty and favors. I testify that Thou hast created me to know Thee, called me into being to serve Thee, and caused me to speak in Thy praise. I beseech Thee, O God of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, to prevent me not from hearkening unto Thy call nor from beholding the manifestations of Thy power and the evidences of Thy might. Strengthen my heart, O my God, that it may be detached from all else but Thee, hold fast unto the cord of Thy grace and cling to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty. O Lord! I am the poor and lowly one who hath come unto the ocean of Thy riches, and the weak and helpless one who hath laid hold on the cord of Thy power. I testify that I know not what is with Thee, nor do I know what profiteth me. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance and the stars in the heaven of Thy grace to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall benefit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. O Lord! Disappoint me not from the gate of Thy bounty which Thou hast opened before the faces of all who are in Thy heaven and on Thine earth, and withhold me not from the Kawthar of life which hath flowed from the Pen of Thy generosity in Thy days. Thou art He to Whose power, might, grandeur and sovereignty every tongue hath testified. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, worthy to answer prayer. Send down, O my God, upon Thy loved ones and chosen ones, who were deterred neither by the might of princes from turning toward Thee, nor by the doubts of the divines from drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory, that which beseemeth Thy bounty, Thy favors, Thy grace and Thy gifts. Then assist them with the hosts of the unseen and the seen, that they may manifest Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word whereby the limbs of all names have quaked and the hearts of the aggressive ones in the realm of creation have trembled. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>In the name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be unto my Lord - praise that transcendeth all that this servant possesseth - for He hath caused the river of His mercy to flow from the Supreme Pen and through His most exalted Word hath summoned all created things to the ultimate goal and the highest summit. Through Him did He take, and through Him did He give. By His fire was the Tree of Sinai set ablaze, and by the light of His divine manifestation was the mountain reduced to dust and Moses struck down. By His single call were all things made to cry out, and by His single name were all the Messengers of the world guided aright. At times He concealed, and at times He revealed. May the souls of all the worlds be a sacrifice unto His concealment and His revelation! Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him! Though sorrows march before His face and grief follows behind, He speaketh both night and day that which a single letter thereof surpasseth all that is visible and invisible. He hath manifested and caused to appear that which hath struck down with awe all who are in the heavens and on earth, save them who were embraced by the outpourings of their Lord and were delivered by the hand of His power that holdeth sway over all things, be they great or small.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the rivers have flowed, the fruits have appeared, and distinction hath been made between the righteous and the wicked! I beseech Thee by the Name which Thou hast made the key to the doors of Thy knowledge and wisdom, and the sun in the heaven of Thy manifestation and power, to assist Thy loved ones to glorify Thee and serve Thy Cause. O Lord! Thou seest them hastening to Thy lands and realms to manifest Thy sovereignty and promote Thy Cause. O Lord! I implore Thee by Thy Most Exalted Self to make them as one word and a celestial melody, then through them, O my God, attract the hearts of Thy servants and creatures. Make them among those whom the manifestations of the world have not prevented from arising to serve Thee, nor the clamor of nations from turning to Thy horizon. O Possessor of might and Sovereign of power! Through them shatter the idols which the people of the Furqan and the Bayan have carved with the hands of idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Thou art He, O my God, before Whose manifestations of power the very essence of power hath bowed down, and before Whose revelations of might the very reality of strength hath submitted. Thou art He to Whose greatness all things have testified, and to Whose loftiness, elevation and glory every letter hath borne witness. O Lord! Thou seest Thy loved ones among the most wretched of Thy creation, and Thy chosen ones amidst the most rebellious of Thy servants. Every day there befalleth them what hath not befallen Thy chosen ones of old. They hear, yet remain silent in compliance with what Thou hast commanded them in Thy Book, such that they refrain from objecting to the servants even when the clouds of hatred rain down upon them the arrows of tribulation from the enemies of Thy Self. O Lord! Aid them through the wonders of Thy help, and preserve them from all that is repugnant to Thy good-pleasure.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest them turning toward Thee and gazing at Thy horizon. Ordain for them from the Pen of Thy decree that which will exalt them in every world of Thy worlds and draw them nearer to Thee in all conditions. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Hearer, the Answerer. There is none other God but Thee, the Ordainer, the Giver, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>I pray, I send My peace, I glorify and I extol the words of Thy Scriptures and the letters of Thy Books through which, by Thy bounty and favor, the horizons of the heavens of detachment were illumined, and through which the suns of steadfastness shone forth in honor of Thy greatness and sovereignty. They are those of whom every book hath spoken in praise and glory, and every tongue hath proclaimed their loftiness and acceptance. They are those whom the gestures of creation did not prevent from soaring in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, nor did the manifestations of princes hinder from drawing nigh unto the horizon of Thy Revelation. They have cast aside the world and circled round the Most Great Name through which the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret were revealed. These are Thy friends and chosen ones upon whom the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise, and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn, send their blessings.</p>
<p>And furthermore, O beloved of my heart, the letters of your missive caused Me to hear the cooing of the Dove that warbled upon the branches of the Tree of God’s love. When I recognized and heard this, rapture and attraction seized Me, and I turned toward the Most Exalted Goal until I was present and laid before His Countenance what was therein. Then did the Ancient Beauty turn toward this evanescent one and spoke that which diffused the fragrance of grace throughout the world. He said, exalted be His glory: In My Name, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>We have remembered thee and sent thee diverse Tablets, every letter of which speaketh of My grace and favor unto thee and maketh mention of what thou hast wrought in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. Thou art he who hath traversed the lands and countries to proclaim the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Be thou ablaze with the fire of the Word of God, that thou mayest guide souls to this luminous horizon. Beware lest the coldness of those who have veiled themselves in the days of God, denied His proof and disbelieved in His signs when He came with the kingdom of names upon the clouds of destiny with manifest sovereignty, cause thee to falter. Be thou vocal in My remembrance, turning to My horizon and holding fast to My firm cord. Grieve not for what thou hast heard from those who have denied God and His signs, and who have clung to that which the followers of the Qur’an clung to before. Rather, We find them more veiled than all other sects. To this testifieth He Who speaketh on this Day of God: “Verily, I am the Manifest, the Commanding, the All-Knowing.”</p>
<p>Consider those who deemed themselves the most exalted of people and counted themselves among the saved community - how with but a slight test they were found more rebellious and transgressing than all the sects of the earth. Say: O friends! By the sun of the horizon of divine knowledge, this Wronged One hath had and hath no purpose save the salvation of mankind. At a time when all kings and subjects arose in opposition, this Wronged One summoned all on earth to the Most Exalted Horizon with the loudest call and guided them to the straight path.</p>
<p>Observe how the veils and clouds of glory that deprived people from the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, were rent asunder by the arm of power and might and the hands of authority. Now it is seen that the people of Bayan have freshly clung to former conjectures and the fancies of false souls. Say: O friends of God! Arise for God and in His path, that perchance ye may preserve the souls on earth from existing idols and limited fancies, until they behold themselves free and detached through divine grace. God willing, they shall gather mankind beneath the shade of a single Word and shall behold the outward and inward clad in one garment.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Fix your gaze upon this Word, which is of the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge, and ponder it: Until ye recognize the falsehood of the past, ye shall not testify to the truth of today and shall remain deprived of the ocean of truthfulness. God, with perfect grace and kindness, offereth counsel and commandeth that which causeth the exaltation and elevation of His Cause. O ye essences! Today is the day of testing and the day of supreme profit. Waste not the moments which are more precious than red sulphur, and strive to manifest that which beseemeth and behooveth man.</p>
<p>O Lion! O thou who gazest upon the One, the Peerless! Observe how distant are the people of the Bayan, as though they had not attained even a drop from the Kawthar of inner meanings. They have newly purposed to build a region with fingers of falsehood and hatred, to establish sources of vain imaginings, and are freshly occupied with arranging first and second Imams. Have they not reflected upon the power of God, how He rent asunder the veils of the people and made manifest the falsehood of that which was in the hands of the transgressing and rebellious faction? For years they turned to an imaginary place and an imaginary person […]</p>
<p>For years they clung and held fast to an imaginary place, an imaginary person, and imaginary matters. Then, when the Hand of Power in this Revelation rent asunder the veils, they witnessed with their outward eyes that all which had been spoken before was bereft of truth and devoid of sincerity. Nevertheless, they have once again become afflicted with delusions greater than before. Break the idols of fancy and vain imaginings in the name of thy Lord! Thus doth the Lord of all names command thee. Verily, He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Beseech ye the True One to sanctify your ears from that which is with the veiled ones among the people of the Bayan and the Furqan, that perchance they may attain unto this Call which is more delicate than a breeze, more subtle than spirit, and sweeter than divine protection. Should anyone contemplate with justice and fairness that blessed word which was mentioned as the pearls of the divine ocean of knowledge, he would observe those imaginary souls to be as earthworms. Every person possessed of smell findeth in their words a most foul odor, to this beareth witness the Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven.</p>
<p>Say: This is the Day of God, wherein none is mentioned save Him. Where is the station of this most holy, most exalted Day compared to the utterances of those remote, veiled, and imaginary souls? Say: By God! He heareth not your words nor walketh in your way. He hath appeared and made manifest His straight Path. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him, and woe unto them that turn away. Glory be to him who hath believed in the Glory of God, detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say: O earthworms! If ye turn away from this horizon, to what horizon will ye turn? And if ye deny these manifest verses, these evident proofs, these shining testimonies, and these perfect words, by what proof are ye able to establish any matter? This is not the station of vain imaginings - the Sun of certitude is shining and the ocean of knowledge is surging. Say: O people of the Bayan! Ye were not and are not aware of the Source of the Cause. Be fair, open your eyes, that perchance ye may become aware and attain the ornament of acceptance. That which is lost today, ye were not and shall never be able to recover. Thus hath spoken the True One before and in this moment.</p>
<p>Today the Mother Book speaketh. Eyes and ears must be sanctified from what they have seen and heard, that they may receive their portion and share of this supreme bounty and profound favor. Verily, He hath spoken the truth. Blessed is every hearing and seeing one. Praise be to God, the Powerful, the Counselor, the Compassionate, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>God willing, your honor will at all times be confirmed in mentioning and expressing the Cause of the Beloved of all possibility. Concerning what you wrote about arriving in the Land of ?ad and attaining the blessing of visiting the two Luminous Lights, upon them be the Glory of God and His mercy - truly this is a blessing not vouchsafed to everyone, and this servant, with both outer and inner tongue, uttereth and mentioneth “Would that I were with your honor!” Alas that this evanescent servant did not attain to that which was befitting and worthy of the Divine days. How pleasing and delightful for your honor!</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the affairs of the Sul?anu’sh-Shuhada (King of Martyrs), may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him - God willing you will be assisted in that which is beloved of God. The most beloved of all things in the sight of God has been and is to manifest love and service to the King of Martyrs and his kindred. The veils of glory have prevented the eyes of the world from beholding the fruits of deeds - otherwise, by God’s life, the wolves and serpents in deserts and wilderness would cry out “Oh, woe unto us!” They committed such a grievous wrong, yet remain in utter heedlessness, occupied in these numbered days with ornaments of wealth and words. In gatherings and assemblies they mention and lament the martyrdom of past saints, unaware that the King of Saints wails and laments due to the cruelty of those wretches. The lamentation of Noah, the affliction of Job, the anguish of Zachariah, and the cry of the chosen ones were due to the oppression of such heedless souls and their like. May the True One, exalted be His glory, grant insight and bestow a portion from the ocean of justice.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the friends being newly enkindled by the fire of the Word and engaged in the remembrance of God - God willing, through the grace of His chosen ones, may they ever be adorned with praise and glorification of the Lord of Names. This evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to increase your confirmations at every moment so that all deeds, actions and words may be witnessed and heard as one. O people of the world! By God, the Truth has come - the Lord of Eternity has appeared with the Most Great Name, and with Him is that which was with all the Messengers. Blessed is he who has turned unto Him; woe to the heedless ones.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart and he who is mentioned before my Lord! The Cause is most mighty and the people are most heedless. Skilled physicians are needed so that chronic diseases may be cured by the holy breaths. Some time ago this blessed and decisive Word shone forth from the horizon of the mouth of the will of the Lord of Oneness - exalted be His glory: “This is a most great and wondrous Day, for He hath appeared in the garment of ‘He’ speaking as the manifest ‘I’.”</p>
<p>Would that the people of the Bayan, who like the people of the Furqan count themselves among the saved, would reflect on the greatness of this Day! Have they not heard the cooing of the Dove of the Furqan and the warbling of the Nightingale of the Bayan? Or have they not attained to that which God revealed in previous Books? They speak that from which the Books of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, dissociate themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about intending to travel to the land of N and J - this matter is most praiseworthy. The journeys of God’s chosen ones to cities and villages for teaching God’s Cause, protecting the believers, and guiding His servants have been and are beloved, nay, essential. From time to time, one who truly speaks for God’s sake and gazes toward God should journey to certain lands including A and R and N and J and Q and M and their surroundings. He guides whom He wishes to a straight path. Most of the people of the Bayan had and have no knowledge of the foundation of this Cause. They cling to falsehood and are deprived of truth. This servant begs God to guide all and grant them sustenance from the fruits of the Tree of Faithfulness. Verily, He is the Ordainer, the Generous.</p>
<p>Until this point the answer to that eminent one’s letter dated the 12th of Rabi’u’th-Thani has been submitted, and subsequently the exalted letter dated the 27th of Rabi’u’th-Thani brought joy to this evanescent one’s heart. God willing, may this love and kindness ever remain constant and enduring. The remembrance of the friends is auspicious to the Friend. After perusal, it was presented in the Most Holy Court and all of it was submitted. This answer was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Most Mighty, the Most Great</p>
<p>Glorified be He Who hath appeared with the truth and hath manifested what He desired by a command from His presence. He, verily, is the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. The ears have been blessed by hearkening to the call of the All-Merciful, and the eyes have been solaced by beholding the praised station. Yet behold the people and their paucity of understanding - they turn away from God while saying “We are turned towards Him.” The Tongue of Grandeur hath judged them as liars when He came with the truth and spoke: “There is none other God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.” They have disputed the verses and proof of God while saying “We believe in Him Who appeared before.” Thus have their souls seduced them, and they understand not. Say: By God, He Whom ye claim in the nights and days doth circle round the House and lamenteth because of your oppression, while ye perceive it not. Say: O people of the Bayan, be fair in what hath appeared and become manifest from the horizon of possibility, and follow not vain imaginings and idle fancies. Turn unto Him with radiant faces and illumined hearts that ye may find what Moses found on Sinai and the Beloved found in the frequented House. Say: He needeth not the books of the world to prove His Cause. To this hath testified the Lord of nations Who came and gave glad tidings to all of this Name whereby every lofty mountain was crushed to dust. Cast behind you your vain imaginings and shatter the idols by the name of your Lord, the Glorious, Whose greatness hath been attested by the Books of God, the Sovereign of existence. O people of the Bayan! Present yourselves before the All-Merciful and ponder on that which hath been sent down in truth. He will guide you to the supreme horizon. To this doth testify He with Whom are the mysteries of what hath been and what shall be. Fear God, and invalidate not the truth through your desires, and believe not every speaker whom prejudice hath kept back from this Stream which hath flowed from the Pen of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Reflect upon God’s proofs and signs, then be fair, and follow not every rejected impostor. By God! He hath appeared like the sun at high noon. Blessed is the eye that hath turned toward Him and beheld, and woe unto every heedless one who is veiled. Thus have We mentioned thee that thou mayest mention the people, that haply they may abandon what they possess and take what hath been sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>The Truth hath shone forth as the sun from the horizon of the heaven of grace, yet the disease of vain imaginings hath prevented eyes from beholding it. The Call hath been raised to such a degree as cannot be mentioned, yet the ears have been deprived thereof through the assaults of selfish desires. All utterance hath been and is dependent upon the word of acceptance, and He Who revealed it declareth: “I am the first to worship Him.” Behold ye the greatness of this Cause! The heedlessness of the servants and the turning away of the people of the Bayan are among the ordained matters. This Most Great, this wondrous Cause is unprecedented in all respects; past and future examples cannot comprehend it. Consider the heedlessness of these veiled souls! If they deny this Most Great, Most Exalted and Most Wondrous Cause, by what proof do they establish the truth of what came before and what came even before that? A one-year-old child of this Revelation is mightier than all the peoples. Say: Look ye in the Books of God that ye may recognize that from which ye have been veiled. He, verily, is the Counsellor, the Sincere, the Evident, the Kind, the Generous. Efface all that ye have heard and seen, and fix your gaze upon that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of God’s knowledge. By the life of God! Then will His straight path and the lights of His Great Name become manifest unto you. Say: The Truth hath never waited and waiteth not for anyone’s belief, and the Books before the Bayan and others have testified to and foretold the turning away of the people. O Lion! O thou who gazest upon the One, the Single! It behooveth thee to beseech God night and day to aid His weak servants who have cast aside the Most Great Ocean and have hastened, turning away from it towards the pool. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctification that the people of the Bayan appear more veiled than the people of the Furqan. After all exertions and the rending of veils, it is observed that this people cling to, hold fast to, and utter the same words which that rebellious and insolent group before them spoke. A hundred thousand pities that ears should be occupied in hearkening unto such words! They are not even aware enough to consider what became of those souls before who uttered such vain words, and what fruit it yielded them. By the life of God! They wander in the valley of error and are immersed in the ocean of heedlessness. O Most Exalted Pen! Leave the mention of these people and illumine the horizon of the heaven of Thy Lord’s Book with the sun of proof and evidence. Then give glad tidings to the peoples of creation of the appearance of the Lord of Names and the Creator of Heaven. Say: By God! The appointed time hath come, and the breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted throughout all contingent being. Blessed is he who hath inhaled and found, and he whose heart hath turned, and he whose face hath been illumined, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Turn not unto the people and their doubts, but unto the Truth and Its manifestations which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Those who turned away from the proof when the All-Merciful came with clear signs have lost, and he who took hold of it by the power of God, the Strong, the Mighty, hath won. Say: All the books of the world cannot be compared to one Tablet from Him. The Tongue of Grandeur hath testified to this, and behind it all things, if ye be of them that hear. Glory be to God! The wondrous, transcendent verses that have been sent down bear no resemblance to verses of the past, and yet they have said that which no oppressor hath said in the days of Manifestation. Shame upon them and perdition upon them! Have they not seen the new Books and heard the wondrous verses? One is amazed at the heedlessness that hath encompassed that people. Yea, by My life! The sightless one is deprived of beholding the effulgences of the rays of the Sun of Truth, and the deaf one is prevented from hearing the call of the All-Merciful. Verily, He hath spoken the truth and speaketh with justice. The Command is in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>As you mentioned in your letter that on the 9th of Rabi’u’th-Thani you acted as a deputy in visitation, God Himself beareth witness that these words were truly glad-tidings which caused my heart and soul to be adorned with the grace of joy and delight. This evanescent servant hopeth that the All-Bountiful Lord may grant you complete recompense, for verily He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Would that this servant had been with you and had attained unto that which you attained. Though this servant is certain that your deputyship is dearer than any act this ephemeral one could himself perform, praise be to God that you have graciously granted this lowly one a share in your blessed, praiseworthy and acceptable deeds.</p>
<p>With regard to what you wrote concerning Jinab-i-Mulla R.J., upon him be the Glory of God, God willing he is protected through divine grace. Some time ago, a word concerning him was heard from the blessed tongue, and from that word this servant became assured that no harm would befall him. This servant beseeches and hopes from the Truth that at all times he may drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness, in such wise that neither doubts nor insinuations, whether from near or far, may prevent him, and that he may be occupied with teaching the Cause of the All-Merciful with perfect wisdom and utterance.</p>
<p>O my master! The friends of God have not been and are not aware of the root of this Cause, and since the delusions of the past and their effects remain in ears and hearts, therefore certain souls are debarred by foul odors from the sweet fragrances of the garden of inner meanings. This evanescent servant beseeches and hopes from the Truth, exalted be His glory, that He may bestow upon all from the chalice of certitude and assurance, that all may observe His Cause with the eye of God and arise to serve it in such wise that they may regard all else as non-existent and null.</p>
<p>One day I was present before His countenance when He said: “O thou who art present! Pray and beseech the Truth that He may protect the souls who have turned towards Him from the doubts of the suspicious ones, and in these days when the horizon of the heaven of Revelation is illumined with the lights of His countenance, He may grant salvation from extinction and destruction to those who are assured. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.” Then such utterances were revealed from the divine kingdom of knowledge that this servant beheld himself bewildered and amazed, to such an extent that I was and am truly incapable and powerless to mention them.</p>
<p>With utmost humility and supplication, I beseech the Gracious, the Merciful One that He may not deprive creation of the outpourings of His days. Verily, He is the One to Whose pardoning grace, generosity, bounty and bestowal all created things have testified. It is strange that souls speak without awareness and that others listen to and accept such vain words. Divine verses are being revealed like torrential rain, to such an extent that it has not been and is not possible to record them, and until now no one has enumerated them. Nevertheless, they have said that He takes two words from the Bayan and two words from the Qur’an, fashions verses from them and sends them abroad. And this statement has come from one who, by God besides Whom there is no God, was not worthy to be mentioned or to speak in the Holy Presence.</p>
<p>Until now, this servant has, according to command, effaced in water the equivalent of what was revealed by the Point (the Bab), may the souls of all else be sacrificed for Him, and what remains equals what has been seen from the Primal Point and the previous Prophets, nay rather exceeds it. Every fair-minded and discerning person bears witness to this. Would that, would that the servants would reflect upon what they say and utter! If only some would truly rend the veils and observe the conditions revealed by God! In such case they would become illumined by the lights of the dawn of divine knowledge and wisdom, and would utter the blessed words “Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend!” This evanescent servant has not been and is not permitted to unveil, otherwise I would have presented that which would adorn the accepted ones with the ornament of knowledge […]</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Consider those who give ear to such vain and absurd utterances. Has truth ever been, or can it ever be, confounded with aught else besides itself? Nay, by Him Who hath caused all things to proclaim His praise! The Cause is even as the sun - manifest, resplendent, clear and evident. Where are the penetrating eyes? Where are the attentive ears? Where are the enlightened breasts? Where are the illumined and detached hearts?</p>
<p>Some of these false souls have said to one of the assured ones who had drunk from the ocean of certitude that “this copy of the Bayan which you possess is not the original - you have corrupted it. The original is in the possession of His Holiness the Azal.” Consider how far removed such a speaker is from the dawning-place of truth! These words are like unto the false claims which the rebellious and tyrannical sect known as the Shi’ites have uttered throughout twelve hundred years, arguing in their gatherings and assemblies that the complete Qur’an is not in the hands of the people, but rather exists in the imaginary Jabulqa and Jabulsa with their imagined Qa’im, and they still await his appearance to bring forth the remainder of the Qur’an. Woe unto them and unto those who have caused them to wander in the wilderness of fancy and vain imaginings!</p>
<p>Say: O hapless ones! For twelve hundred years you uttered these fabricated words - what was the outcome, and what fruit did it yield for you? What is your purpose, what is your object? Hearken to the words of this evanescent servant, and do not that which they did of old, and speak not that which they spoke. Fix your gaze upon the dawning-place of the Revelation and turn toward the horizon of divine knowledge. In this Revelation all are bound to behold the Truth through the Truth itself, for It hath never been and never shall be known through aught else. To this testify all sacred Books, all holy Scriptures, all divine Tablets and every perspicuous Text.</p>
<p>Say: O misguided ones! Have mercy upon the people! Spread not anew the carpet of vain imagining, and leave not the poor and weak to wander in the valley of bewilderment. It is hoped that the people of the Crimson Ark will arise for God’s sake and speak for God’s sake, that perchance they may protect the helpless servants from the doubts and allusions of souls that are remote and veiled. Tears are flowing and sighs are ascending, for we behold the divine sheep pursued by ravening wolves, and the pearls of divine love lying in wait for thieves and betrayers. The place of counsel and remembrance is encompassed by the darkness of heedlessness and fancy. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of all worlds and the Master of this mighty Day.</p>
<p>Through your efforts, this petition and the petitions sent to their honors Mulla ’Ali-Akbar and Ibn-i-Abhar and others - the splendor of God rest upon them - which deal with these matters, should be copied. After complete review and correction, they should be sent to assured, steadfast and firm souls, such as his honor R.J., upon him be 66-9 [Baha’u’llah], and others like him who are in various lands, that they might remind the people and protect them from that which God loveth not. Blessed are they who arise for God’s sake.</p>
<p>Blessed are those souls who arise for God’s sake and guard the Cause, protecting it from that which God does not love. While penning this letter, the missive of his honor Ha and Sin, upon him be the glory of God, which he had written to his honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be [the glory of God], brought joy to this evanescent one’s heart. In that letter was the glad tidings of the arrival of that honored one and the son of Ismullah, upon them both be the glory of God. They had also written a letter to this servant. God willing, I hope in these days to be enabled to reply to their letter. I request that you convey, on behalf of this evanescent servant, expressions of utter effacement and nothingness to them and to all the friends in that land. God willing, it is hoped that from the horizons of hearts the sun of unity will shine forth and become the cause and means of illumining all regions and countries. Glory be upon you and upon those who have attained the wine of steadfastness in the days of God, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>=== END BH00119 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00120 ===</p>
<p>The Beloved of the heart, His Honor the Trustee - upon him be the Glory of God, the True and Manifest King - may take note.</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord.</p>
<p>The testimony of Truth, exalted be His glory, is sufficient for His Own Self. He has said, and His word is the truth: “He cannot be described by any description besides His Own, nor can He be known by any besides Himself.” The praise of those who praise and the glorification of those who glorify are bounded by human limitations, and from the Most Great Horizon to the human station lies an endless path. How can the condition of a servant be compared with that station which is sanctified beyond all sanctification and glorification, let alone other stations? The station that cannot be comprehended is not known through comprehension, and that which cannot be described is not encompassed by description. Exalted be His grandeur, elevated be His dominion, and magnificent be His majesty! It has been said of old: “The way is blocked, and the path is barred.” However, the letters of the friends and their mention, praise, detachment and attraction open a joyful door and diffuse a sweet fragrance. Though we may not attain to befitting praise and description, they have brought us somewhat closer to the path. For when that beloved one’s letter arrives, the heart records something and joy takes hold from all directions. Though the letter has no tongue, yet it speaks and expresses with eloquent language. Wherever one places one’s hand, no ear is found, yet what a wonderful hearer and what an excellent bearer of news it is! Its fragrance spreads news and its acceptance and attention listen attentively. Whence comes this power, and whence this witnessing and hearing? All this is from God’s grace - our Lord, your Lord, and the Lord of the heavens and earths.</p>
<p>I beseech God to make the world one region and one homeland, as has been revealed in the Tablets from the heaven of His Will, and to grant His servants the ability to occupy themselves with the betterment of the world and the refinement of their own souls, so that the light of knowledge may encompass all possibility. The purpose of knowledge is those matters that preserve humans from what is unworthy and guide them to what is worthy. We beseech Him to grant this success which He has revealed in His scriptures and tablets, and to deliver His servants from the abyss of suppositions and idle fancies which is in truth the abyss of perdition. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty.</p>
<p>Thereafter, that beloved of the heart’s handwriting, dated the twelfth of the month of Safar and numbered 6, its effect superior to the spring rains and the springtime of creation, gave freshness to the heart and illumined the sight. After reading and inhaling its fragrance, proceeding to the station of the Lord of all beings, it was presented before the Seat of Grandeur, and at that moment a pleasing command was manifested, and this too is evidence of the grace of Truth, exalted be His glory, upon His servants, His loved ones, and His companions. The Tongue of Grandeur was speaking and this servant was engaged in writing before His presence when three persons arrived from His Honor Afnan, Mr.&nbsp;Mirza Aqa - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - each carrying in hand a tray filled with true confections. In truth, this is evidence of that beloved one’s sincerity, detachment, and spiritual orientation. In any case, after returning, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses, exalted be His utterance and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed…</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Amin! Hear the call of God, the True King, the Manifest One, on this Day of Judgment. He calleth aloud with the most exalted voice, making mention of all who dwell in the kingdom of creation, and summoneth them unto God, the Possessor of this luminous Day. The servant who is present hath appeared and read thy letter before the Wronged One. We have answered thee with that which draweth the hearts of them that hearken. We made mention of thee before, and sent unto thee from the precincts of the Prison the fragrances of the All-Merciful, that thou mightest inhale them and be amongst the thankful. It behooveth one to write the verses of God with gold rather than with ink. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing Teacher. Blessed is the servant who hath cast away his desires, clinging fast to the Lord of all humanity, Who hath come from the heaven of bounty with a mighty command and hath desired naught save the unity of hearts. To this testifieth every fair-minded and discerning soul. Corruption hath been abolished and righteousness established by the command of God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O concourse of the earth! Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. Arise to that which profiteth and exalteth you. Verily, He hath appeared with the truth and hath bidden all to godliness and that whereby man’s station in creation may be made manifest. Exalted is the All-Merciful, the Manifestor of that which draweth people nigh unto His straight Path. We beseech God to aid all to do that which He loveth and approveth. Verily, He is the Protector of them that act. Blessed art thou, O Amin, for having girded up thy loins to serve God, thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty Throne. He is with thee and beholdeth what thou doest and heareth what thy tongue uttereth concerning this manifest News. Beware lest the veils of glory prevent thee from the lights of beauty, or the power of the oppressors weaken thee in regard to the Cause of God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad tidings of the heaven of My mercy, the ocean of My bounty, and the sun of My loving-kindness. Say: By God! Ye have attained unto that which none besides you hath attained. To this beareth witness the Book of God, the Speaking, the All-Knowing. We counsel you, O My loved ones, to be trustworthy and godly, that the attributes of your Lord and His sanctification may be made manifest among His servants and throughout the lands. He, verily, is the Ancient Commander. Thus have We expounded the verses as a grace from Our presence and sent them unto thee, that thou mightest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Listen in the Persian tongue! Every utterance and remembrance that contains His praise is beloved in whatsoever language it may be - Persian, Turkish, Arabic or other tongues. However, the Arabic language is most eloquent, comprehensive and expansive. Praise be to God, thou hast attained that which befitteth His servants in this Day. The Breath of God hath awakened thee and the warmth of the Sun of Truth hath taken hold of thee. Thou hast arisen to serve and clung to the hem of detachment. All that hath come to pass is from His grace and bounty. Awaken the friends to the Call of Truth. If thou shouldst meet Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, upon him be My glory and favor, convey My greetings and say: O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, hearken with thy inner ear to the Divine Call. For the teacher, naught is needed save confirmatory proofs, for they are knowing of God and recognize Him according to their capacity. This is the gate of guidance and salvation. No knowledge save this is required. Whoso seeketh or asketh for more hath erred. Today, knowledge of God is beloved, recognition of Him is accepted, and His utterance is the goal. Among the sincere ones, the knowledge of God hath been and is the knowledge of devotion, detachment, and awareness of the path. Consider Jesus, son of Mary. His disciples in the early days were sanctified and free from outward knowledge. Likewise were the companions of the Seal of the Prophets, may our souls be a sacrifice for His sake, in the beginning of His revelation. Many were from the marketplaces. O Haydar-Qabli-’Ali, the fisherman became the fisher of men, and the wooden staff struck down the swords of the world. These are the works of steadfastness, reliance and sanctification. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of inner meanings and utterance from the Hand of the All-Merciful’s bounty. Thou art the cupbearer of the choice sealed wine, possessing it in the name of the Self-Subsisting. Drink and give to drink, that perchance the heedless servants may become aware, find the path of God and hold fast to His cord. The diverse sciences belong to the turbaned ones who, in the cities and regions of Iran, curse the Goal of all the worlds from their pulpits. God protect us and thee from their whispers, their doubts and their allusions. A single craft from among the crafts of the East and West that today serveth mankind and is the cause of ease and comfort for the servants is, in the sight of God, superior to all that those heedless souls have carried and declare from their pulpits. Know thou with clear certainty that the effulgence of this Most Great Revelation hath encompassed the world, and ere long such means and crafts shall appear in the realm of being as shall confound the minds of the possessors of understanding. Praise be to God, thou hast attained unto true knowledge. Now recognition and acceptance are needed, that all servants may be adorned with the ornament of recognition and illumined by the lights of acceptance. From this recognition and acceptance shall appear that which no eye hath ever beheld. Reflect upon Christ and the outward crafts. Verily thy Lord is the Expositor, the All-Knowing, and He is the Wise Craftsman. The most great cause and supreme reason for whatsoever was seen before or shall be seen hereafter, or hath appeared or shall appear, hath been and is the Divine verses and the Will and Purpose of the Lord. The ladder of knowledge is high, and the feet of the servants are afflicted with paralysis. The horizon is radiant, but vision is weak. In any case, I beseech the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted to show generosity, to bestow bounty, to grant healing in His Name, the Healer. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Concerning the Afnan upon him be the Glory of God, who is attracted to the verses of God and immersed in the ocean of His love and soaring in the atmosphere of His affection and will, who was named Muhammad in the Book of God, the Lord of all beings, what you wrote was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. The Lord, exalted and sanctified be He, speaks: “O Amin! Verily Muhammad has attained My presence and circled round My throne and stood before the gate of My grandeur and spoke My praise. He is the one mentioned in My prison and witnessed before My countenance. Give him the glad tidings of My favor. We beseech God to send down upon him that which will draw him near in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.”</p>
<p>And likewise concerning the honored Afnan, His Excellency Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, after being presented at the highest horizon and supreme height, these verses were revealed from the heaven of the will of the Lord of all beings. His blessed and exalted Word: “O My Afnan! Upon thee be My Glory! Praise the Desired One of the world Who granted confirmation and bestowed success, Who gave determination, manifested capacity and ability until He guided thee to the supreme height and ultimate goal. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me to the path of Thy good-pleasure and caused me to hear the verses of Thy Most Exalted Pen when the seat of Thy throne was established in the prison of ’Akka, and for having taught me what was hidden in the treasuries of Thy knowledge from time immemorial. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Ruler of the Kingdom, by Thy Most Great Name, to ordain for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will cause my mention to endure among all mentions, my name among all names, and my spirit among all spirits. Verily Thou art the Lord of all beings and within Thy grasp is the key to success. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveys greetings and glorification to each of these gentlemen. Praise be to God, they are present and have attained His favor. The servant beseeches his Lord to ordain for them both that which will cause them to be among those who circle round His mighty throne. There is none other God but He, the Fulfiller of the needs of all who ask. Supreme joy, delight and happiness have been attained because that beloved one has in every instance recorded mention of the Afnan and their adherence to the Divine Lote-Tree and their being set ablaze with the fire of the Lote-Tree and whatsoever hath been manifested from them in the path of God, and likewise the mention of the loved ones of God and what hath appeared from them in His path. That beloved one hath ever been and continues to be the cause of the manifestation of divine bounties and favors concerning His loved ones. This is a mighty grace and a great blessing.</p>
<p>O Amin, upon thee be My glory! Thou didst make mention of Muhammad-Husayn, upon him be My glory. Praise be to God that he hath been enkindled with the fire of the love of God, hath turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, and remaineth steadfast in his love for the Peerless Friend. He hath been and continueth to be oriented in his countenance, remembering with his tongue, beholding with his eye, accepting with his heart and grasping with his hand. The deeds of that household have ever been remembered in the presence of the Wronged One - with Him is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book. Give him My glad-tidings and illumine him with that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Pen, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Husayn! The call of the Wronged One is raised, and the lights of His countenance shine forth from the Most Exalted Horizon without veil or covering. Yet the veils of fancy and vain imaginings of the hearts have outwardly prevented the sincere ones from drawing nigh and have held back those who are near from attaining His presence. Praise be to God that in these days when darkness hath encompassed the world, thou hast attained unto the light of the Cause. Beseech God to preserve His people in this Revelation from the fancies and vain imaginings of the former party, namely the Shi’ites, lest they become like that party who hath lost both this world and the next.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the baseness of understanding and the heedlessness of that party. For years they counted themselves the most learned and exalted in the world, yet on the Day of Resurrection they were found to be the most ignorant and abased. Now the new deniers of Bayan desire to occupy people with the vain imaginings of the former party. Glory be to God! That party which clung to the true Ali put to death its Creator, Manifestation and Source on the Day of His appearance. Now what will these souls who cling to the false Ali do, and what excellence will they manifest? It behooveth those possessed of insight to weep and lament, for they have sullied the Day of God with their own delusions. Today a thousand Alis are circumambulating, created by a single word of the chosen ones and holy ones. The former party, with their countless claims and immeasurable pride, their most renowned, most learned and most ascetic ones occupy the pulpits cursing the Goal of all the worlds. They testified to the infidelity of the King of being, Whom they had beseeched night and day with utmost humility, submissiveness and lamentation to attain His presence, and issued the verdict for His blood to be shed. What then hath befallen and will befall the new deniers? This utterance hath repeatedly descended from the heaven of knowledge as a token of grace, that the people of God may be aware and may protect the servants from new fancies and vain imaginings. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen spoken, as a favor from Me unto thee. When thou hearest it, say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou Goal of the world! And glory be to Thee, O Thou Beloved of the hearts of the sincere ones!</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Muhammad Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God. He, blessed and exalted, says: O Muhammad Hasan, upon you be My Glory! The honored Amin, upon him be My Glory, mentioned you and sent it to the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to assist you and enable you to do that which He loves and is pleased with, and to make you among those who have arisen to serve the Cause and have held fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed art thou for having turned to the Wronged One while He was imprisoned in the hands of the heedless. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Illumine my face with the lights of Thy countenance and my heart with the radiance of Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen to make me, in all conditions, steadfast in Thy Cause and firm in Thy love, such that nothing whatsoever shall prevent me from Thy remembrance, O Thou Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Beauteous.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The waves of the divine ocean of generosity have encompassed both, and the rain of grace is so abundantly pouring and descending that no speaker can find words to describe it. His mercy is continuous and His grace is successive. Every person of insight is bewildered and every person of understanding is perplexed, for His grace has exceeded all reckoning and His generosity has transcended all bounds. How lofty is this most exalted station and supreme summit! Glorified be He Who raised it, glorified be He Who established it, and glorified be He Who confirmed it. There is no God but Him.</p>
<p>As for the repeated mention of Haji H.S. (upon him be the Glory of God) and the supplications made for divine favors upon him, his mention has repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and at this time these blessed words and radiant verses have been revealed from the heaven of grace. He, blessed and exalted, says: The mention of Muhammad-before-H and S, upon him be My Glory, has repeatedly been revealed. God has forgiven him as a favor from His presence, purified him, and enabled him to serve His Cause. He turned in the early days to the Most Exalted Horizon and drank the sealed nectar from the hand of the bounty of My Name, the Self-Subsisting. He shattered the idols of fancy and vain imaginings through the power of his Lord, the Possessor of mankind, and rent asunder the veils through My Name, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Amin! These deeds which have been manifested by him from the beginning of the Cause until now have not been and will not be forgotten. Verily, thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Make mention of him on behalf of the Wronged One and convey to him what has been revealed for him from the Most Exalted Pen. Likewise for the emigrants who emigrated and attained with him the Most Holy Court. By the life of God! There has been ordained for each one, male and female, that which the outward eye has not been and is not capable of beholding. He Who possesses the Clear Book bears witness to this. Convey greetings to all on behalf of the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of the waves of the ocean of utterance which have at this time appeared from the Pen of the Most Merciful specifically for them, that the utterance may attract them to the Kingdom of knowledge and bring them to a station wherein the conditions of the world will not change them nor the doubts of the nations sadden them.</p>
<p>O Amin! Blessed art thou and joy be to thee! In every letter thou hast made mention of the friends and hast spoken of A and M and their daughters and other daughters in each of thy letters, and each hath attained to that which hath no equal. In these days, especially for some of the leaves, upon them be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah], the Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of will. We beseech God to confirm all to that which beseemeth His days. In truth, some from the beginning until now have been engaged in service, turning to Him and making mention of Him. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of those men and women who do good and who are devout.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings to all and beareth witness before God, exalted be His glory, to the turning, the devotion, the steadfastness, and the praise and glorification of these assured souls mentioned, and from the ocean of the All-Merciful’s mercy and the sea of divine bounty, he seeketh for each that which shall endure throughout the sovereignty of earth and heaven. Verily our Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, He is the Speaker of Truth, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Sirri Effendi, upon him be the glory of God, after it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, He said: “Yes, O Amin, the one mentioned hath protected and continueth to protect, and from the beginning the sweet savors of love have wafted from him. However, those who have dealings with the government, it often happens that without intention a word escapeth from their tongue. Therefore concealment in this matter is preferable. Thou didst write about this before and an answer was sent. The command remaineth the same and the decree is unchanged. Beseech God to reveal unto all the purpose of this Revelation and His will, that what is hidden in the hearts may become as evident as the sun. In such case all would arise to assist the oppressed. But now the Cause is veiled and doubts and idle fancies are an obstacle. Therefore ye must observe prudence according to the requirements of the time. The former deeds of this group have grieved hearts and minds, therefore until now they cling to their vain imaginings. We beseech God to aid all to witness the signs and fruits of the divine Tree. In such case doubt will be transformed to certitude and agitation to tranquility, and the tongues of all created things will proclaim ‘The Truth hath come.’”</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about thy loved ones, Mulla Husayn and Aqa Hasan, upon them be the glory of God, it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence. The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified is He:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>O Husayn! Upon thee be My glory! The Trusted One made mention of thee, and We make mention of thee in this Clear Tablet. Blessed is the heart that hath on this day turned toward the Supreme Horizon, and the face that hath directed itself to the light of the countenance of its Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Everyone possessed of discernment perceiveth in all things the fragrance of transience. Blessed is the strong one who hath cast it behind him, turning unto God, the Kind, the Generous. Every tongue hath acknowledged the transience of the world and its transformation. Blessed is the seeing one who hath turned away from it and faced toward God, the Lord of the worlds. Say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me and made me know and hear, and for having revealed unto me that which hath set me ablaze with Thy love. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the kingdom of earth and heaven, to make this servant of Thine one who gazeth upon Thee, who speaketh Thy praise, and who holdeth fast unto Thy cord. Then ordain for me the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of all mankind. There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God: He is the One Who gazeth from the horizon of the heaven of bounty</p>
<p>O Hasan Amin, upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness! Thou hast been mentioned and We have remembered thee. Praise be to God, thou hast attained and hast drunk from the Kawthar of bounty which floweth from the Supreme Pen. His mercy hath preceded all things and His loving-kindness hath encompassed all. He hath manifested Himself and made clear the path of success, guiding His servants thereto. Some have heard and attained, while others remain deprived and forbidden from the eternal bounty and the heavenly feast. The cause of their deprivation are those souls who have usurped His station in His name and pass judgment among the servants. Ever have those who outwardly cling to the Truth and are honored by His name sent the people to the abode of perdition. Give praise to the Desired One of the world Who hath made you aware and guided you, and Who hath sent down in the Most Great Prison, by His will, that which hath been and ever shall be the cause of the preservation of names and mention. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>This lowly one conveyeth greetings to each one, and in the nights and days beseecheth from the Desired One of the worlds the exaltation of His loved ones, especially those souls who are associated with and cling to His servants. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, He is the Generous. There is none other God but He, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of my beloved Ibn-i-Abhar, upon them both be the Glory of God, the Lord of Power, and likewise regarding the sum that was sent to him, this matter hath been accepted in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence. His blessed and exalted Word: “O Amin! Excellent is what thou hast done.” We beseech God to aid him to assist His Cause through wisdom and utterance. Spending in His path and assisting His loved ones is acceptable.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God. His petition attained the Most Holy Court and a most wondrous and glorious Tablet was revealed and sent down from the horizon of will. Let him rejoice and give thanks unto our Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Likewise mention was made of Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah and Aqa Mirza Javad, the two dyers, upon them both be the Glory of God. The mention of both was heard in the Greatest Scene before the face of the Lord of Power, and these brilliant verses were sent down from the heaven of bounty. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Faithful Speaker</p>
<p>O Asadu’llah! God willing, thou shalt remain firm and steadfast in the Cause of God with the power and might of a lion. True steadfastness maketh the world steadfast and spiritual attraction causeth the world to become attracted. Ever fix thy gaze upon this word: “He is praised in His deeds and obeyed in His command.” Whosoever holdeth fast to this exalted word, the calumnies of the servants shall not affect him and the clamor of the oppressors and the doubts of the barkers shall not deprive him from the Most Great Ocean. The Trustworthy One hath mentioned thee, and We mention thee as a bounty from Us, and verily We are the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Blessed art thou for having turned, hearkened, and witnessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken before the creation of all things. Verily there is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have drunk the wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for Javad, upon him be the Glory of God, the Lord of Creation. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>In My Name, the All-Bountiful, the Generous […]</p>
<p>O Javad! Ask the leaders of the Shia sect what became of those demands, what happened to that cry of ‘May God hasten’, what were those lamentations in the month of Muharram, and what were those dirges? Judge fairly - you considered yourselves most profitable but were found to be most lost; you counted yourselves most learned but were observed to be most ignorant. O faithless ones! You have torn the veil of honor. The King of existence, through whose bounty all created things were adorned with the ornament of being - Him you cursed and reviled from your pulpits, and finally pronounced the verdict for His martyrdom. Now fear God and have mercy upon yourselves. How long will heedlessness endure? Until when will tyranny persist? The Jews keep their distance from you, let alone the People of the Sunna. For twelve hundred years you played the game of successorship, and finally busied yourselves with cursing the Truth from your pulpits. Shame upon you and upon your beliefs and your faith!</p>
<p>O Javad! Now ponder these matters and thank God that He saved you by the hands of His will and delivered you from ghouls and demons. You heard the call of the Wronged One and responded to it. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! He hath mentioned thee with that which no mention can equal. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the All-Wise, the Helper, the All-Knowing. The glory be upon thee and upon those who have cast the rejectors behind them, turning unto God, the One, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>They mentioned Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Farajullah, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, that he is engaged in praise and thanksgiving and is steadfast in serving the Cause. After this matter was presented before the Most Glorious Horizon, a most holy and mighty Tablet was revealed from the heaven of favor and was sent. God willing, may they obtain eternal life from its verses and drink of the everlasting Kawthar. Praise be to God, they have attained to that for which existence itself was brought into being. This servant conveys greetings and salutations to him and the mentioned souls, upon them be the glory of God, and seeks confirmation and success for them. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Almighty, the Powerful, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of the ascension and passing of the elevated, deceased and blessed His Holiness Raj, upon him be the glory of God, His mercy and His favors - after this was presented in the Most Holy and Most Mighty Presence, there was revealed from the heaven of Will that which is the cause of exaltation and elevation. He was ever remembered in the Most Great Scene. There hath been revealed concerning his station and rank that which the tongues of all created things are powerless to recount. He turned to God on a day when all the divines were engaged in rejection, and he acknowledged the Truth at a time when all were denying it, save those whom God willed. His is a station with God[…]</p>
<p>Likewise mention hath been made of his honor Ibn, upon him be the Glory of God - that is, his honor Shaykh M.H. - and such verses have been revealed as have caused the fragrance of loving-kindness to be diffused among the concourse of those near unto God and them that circle round His throne. Similarly have his other sons, upon them be the Glory of God, been remembered, each one being mentioned in the presence of the Truth. Nothing whatsoever escapeth the knowledge of our Lord. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of the doers of good. This servant beseecheth and imploreth God, exalted be His glory, that He may keep them aflame at all times with the fire of His love and illumined with the light of His Cause, that they may arise to render service and lead men from that which they possess unto that which God possesseth. At this time there is no opportunity to write and send more, but at another time, God willing, it shall be sent, that their eyes may be solaced thereby, their hearts gladdened, and their breasts dilated. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Glory and praise and honor be upon you and upon them that are with you and love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>=== END BH00120 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00121 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>The one God knows that heart, pen and tongue have ever cherished the mention of the friends of God, especially those beloved ones whose remembrance has been deposited in the heart. The multiplicity of affairs and the exigencies of the days have caused that I trouble that loved one less frequently, yet whatsoever was previously mentioned was presented before the Throne and an answer was sent.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the honored beloved, His Holiness Nabil of Qa’in, upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious - wherever he may be, may God be his helper. We hope he will ever gaze upon this blessed verse which was revealed in his Tablet. His blessed and exalted Word: “It behoveth thee to speak forth today that which will set ablaze the hearts and cause the bodies of those who have turned towards God to soar.” And in another place His exalted Word: “Be thou like an artery pulsating in the body of creation, that through the heat generated by this motion there may appear that which will quicken the hearts of the hesitant.” And in yet another place His glorified and mighty Word: “Be thou a promulgator of God’s Cause with an utterance which will cause fire to burn in the trees and will make them proclaim: ‘There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.’” And in one place, concerning the conditions of the people of Baha who arise to serve the Cause, He says, His mighty and glorious Word: “They must not look at what they possess, but at what God possesseth. They must not be attracted by what benefiteth themselves, but by that which will cause God’s Cause to be exalted.”</p>
<p>As to the second matter, concerning what you wrote about Haji Khalil, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors - permission for his journey was previously sent. And concerning what they said about submitting the mentioned sum with the utmost joy and fragrance - excellent is what he hath done for God, our Lord and the Lord of the worlds. In truth, this matter was among his blessings, that immediately upon its mention it was adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Well is it with him! As for his nephew, permission for his journey was previously bestowed and was not contingent upon a second mention - the sun of permission rose with perfect clarity. These matters were again presented before the Presence. This utterance was revealed from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful, His Word, exalted be His grandeur: “O Samandar! Upon thee be My Glory! Convey My greetings to Khalil, upon him be My Glory, and gladden him with the lights of the Sun of favor of the Lord of all beings. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath turned to the All-Informed One.” Likewise was Karim mentioned in the Most Holy Court, and from the Speaker of Sinai the word of permission appeared and shone forth. Give them both glad tidings from Me and remind them of My verses.</p>
<p>The third matter was presented before the Face. This is what was revealed in response: “O Samandar! Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the honorable consort of the late Khan, upon them both be the Glory of God. Their services in the path of God have not been and will never be forgotten from view, and have been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Most Sublime Book. God willing, may they attain to that wherefrom the fragrance of divine good-pleasure shall be eternally wafted throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. What they sent arrived - He with Whom is God’s Book, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, beareth witness to this.” End. This servant conveys greetings and salutations to that leaf, upon her be the Glory of God and His favors. May God grant them success and confirmation.</p>
<p>And as to what was written concerning the branch, it is most clear that the branch follows the root. When the root is reached, surely the branch is reached as well. Perfect grace from the Most Exalted Horizon hath been manifested toward that leaf. Some time ago, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to her. God willing, may she be counted among those whose faces the whisperings of the men and women who join partners with God cannot prevent from the Most Exalted, Most Wondrous Horizon.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about A.B., all that that beloved one hath done is most excellent in the view of this servant. God willing, perhaps it may be the cause of his awakening. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to aid him in abandoning that with which he hath been afflicted. Verily our Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Perhaps after abandonment a new spirit may be breathed, for the Sun of Grace shineth and gleameth in such wise that one cannot despair of any matter or from any direction. Exalted be His grace, magnificent His bounty, and all-embracing His mercy.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about Aqa ’Ali, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], son of His Holiness Haji Na?ir who, as God beareth witness, was martyred in His path - this was presented before His countenance, and one Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent for him. Deliver it unto him. Verily, He is with whosoever is with Him. The station of His Holiness Na?ir, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, is great in the sight of God. Blessed be he! Again blessed be he! Again blessed be he!</p>
<p>Mention was also made in the Most Holy, Most Exalted presence of his brother, Aqa Fadlu’llah, upon him be the Glory of God. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the All-Bountiful. His word, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>He is the Truth, the Knower of the Unseen</p>
<p>O Fadlu’llah! Verily grace hath encompassed you. His favor hath been bestowed and His mercy hath preceded. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. His Holiness Na?ir, upon him be the Glory of God, was imprisoned for God’s sake and ascended in the path of God. He is mentioned before the Wronged One among the martyrs. I swear by the Luminary shining from the horizon of the Prison that he was given that which all who are on earth are powerless to reckon. Blessed is he! Blessed is he! He is among those whom the doubts of the divines, the might of princes, and the clamor of the ignorant could not prevent from the Lord of Names. He abandoned extinction and sought immortality. The various transient colors did not keep him back from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Ye must all walk in his footsteps. Give thanks to God, exalted be His glory, that ye are of him and related to him. His station with God is most great. The Glory be upon thee.</p>
<p>We have heard before Our Throne your communication regarding the handmaiden and consort of the departed Abdul-Hamid, upon him be the Glory of God. We have not until now given permission to property owners to sell. However, since that leaf is saddened by this matter and is concerned about the encroachments upon that property, in this case its sale is necessary, for We desire that leaf to be free and unburdened, occupied at all times with the remembrance of the Creator of existence. Earthly possessions are transient, their owner transient, their possession transient - but the grace of God endures, His favors endure, His remembrance endures, His generosity endures, His verses endure, His evidences endure. Blessed is the one whom transient affairs do not hinder. However, matters must be arranged such that no ill-feelings arise with others, as this is closer to righteousness and piety. If Sa’d is, God willing, truly sa’d (fortunate), he will not be content with that which opposes justice, and even if he be at the level of Mercury, he is still with Sa’d.&nbsp;We beseech God to grant him success and not deprive him from the ocean of His knowledge. Convey My greetings to that leaf and say: Be not saddened by such matters. What is befitting and worthy today, adorned with the ornament of permanence, is the remembrance that hath been revealed from God. Praise be to God that thou hast attained thereunto. And regarding her desire to attain Our presence, give her glad tidings of her Lord’s favor. We have made the word to take the place of the deed, and have accepted it from her as a bounty from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>After what transpired in the Land of Ta, certain matters have arisen in this land as well, and in previous years that which was revealed specifically for this land became known to some of the friends. In some Tablets He says, exalted be His glory: “The outer is calm while the inner is turbulent.” For this reason permission is now withheld, but through His boundless grace this intention has been accepted even before its execution. Well is it with her.</p>
<p>[The remainder appears to be about other matters and individuals…]</p>
<p>O Husayn-’Ali! Thy name is most beloved, and indicative of thy path. This is a name at which the joints of the polytheists tremble and the hearts of the transgressors are troubled. Through this name hath the standard of unity been raised, and by it hath the banner of oneness been hoisted to the most exalted station. Thy mention hath been made, and these verses revealed as a token of grace, that thy heart may rejoice thereby and thine eyes be solaced. Hearken unto the Voice of the Wronged One. Hold fast unto that which is the cause of everlasting salvation and the source of perpetual bounty. The vicissitudes and changes of the world are two most mighty proofs of its transitoriness. We beseech God to protect thee and aid thee in that which will exalt His Word. The cause and means of exaltation are goodly deeds and praiseworthy character. He, exalted be His glory, hath been and will ever be self-sufficient. He hath neither desired nor doth He desire dominion, riches, sovereignty or realm. One deed performed for God’s sake is better than all the wealth of the world. Know thou this and be of them that are steadfast.</p>
<p>Say: O my God! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to recognize Thee. I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance, the fire of Thy Cause, the mysteries of Thy Book, and the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, to aid me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. There is no God but Thee, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Both have drunk from the cup of bounty and received their full portion from the ocean of God’s remembrance. God willing, they shall in all conditions hold fast unto the Self-Sufficing Lord. Their mention was also made before in the Most Holy Court.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of Aqa Mulla Yusuf-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, which was made, it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed for him from the heaven of bounty and favor. His word, exalted be His glory and mighty His utterance:</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!</p>
<p>O Yusuf! Reflect upon the days when one named Joseph was imprisoned, and likewise when he was cast into the well. Consider also Abraham, the Friend of God, and the dedication of the Sacrifice at the place of offering. Behold what befell the Spirit of God, and observe attentively. Likewise consider the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake, and the Herald, the Point of the Bayan, may the spirit of all in the Kingdom be sacrificed for His sake, and what befell Him is not remote. Most have heard and some have witnessed that which came to pass upon the Point and the company of the Prophets and Messengers. It hath been the cause of the exaltation of God’s Word, the promotion of His Cause and its diffusion. Every person of insight beareth witness that the loss hath been with the oppressors, and the profit with those holy and pure souls. Reflect upon the Twin Lights, namely the two martyrs, and Kazim. By the life of God! None hath been or is capable of reckoning the profit of their trading in God’s path. To this testify honored servants who have been given insight from God, the Lord of what was and what will be. Reflect upon one named Mahdi and those who were with him. Did that which befell them in God’s path cause abasement and loss, or was it the cause of the exaltation of the Word, the elevation of stations, and true profit? The days of every soul shall pass away and come to an end. Blessed are they whom these fleeting days have not debarred from the everlasting Kingdom. Know thou with absolute certitude that thy imprisonment in God’s path hath been the cause of thy freedom and the exaltation of thy station with God. Account not this supreme bounty as small. By the life of God! It is most great and glorious. Be on thy guard, for the devils are seen lying in wait. Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy grace through which the gates of knowledge were opened to all who dwell in the realm of possibility, and the breezes of Thy bounty wafted, and the rivers of Thy mercy flowed, to protect me from the mischief of Thine enemies who plot against Thy Cause and lead Thy servants astray. Thou, verily, art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Thou didst desire to attain Our presence, but in these days it is not permitted, for the whisperings of the transgressors and deniers have to some degree spread to these regions. We beseech God to aid thee in His remembrance and praise and in service to His firm and wise Cause. The servant present here hath conveyed that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the servant whose call hath been heard and for whom the verses of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, have been sent down. Hold fast unto goodness and cleave to the hem of righteousness, as bidden by God, the Lord of all men. He, verily, is the Commander, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Mention thou the loved ones of that land on behalf of the Wronged One and convey His greetings. In these days all are remembered before His countenance, for His Trustee, upon him be My glory, hath mentioned the loved ones of God in his letters, especially Afnan and His Honor A. and H., upon them be My glory and loving-kindness. Blessed are they whose remembrances, names and petitions have been presented before His countenance. Although the fruits of these deeds remain hidden due to the land’s unpreparedness, all are preserved in God’s treasury. He will soon reveal them in truth. He, verily, is the Just, the Wise. Not a single letter’s reward has been or will be lost.</p>
<p>Thou didst mention His Honor Siyyid Hashim. We make mention of him and those who have believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed. Blessed is the one whose strength was not shaken by the allusions of the divines and the doubts of the theologians. They arose and proclaimed: “God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.” We beseech God to sanctify the eyes of His servants from the blindness of self and desire, that they may behold the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. Moses came and gave the people glad tidings of His manifestation, yet when Christ appeared, all turned away. The Jewish divines who for years were occupied in their temples with the praise and glorification of the Lord of Names, and were likewise awaiting the days of His appearance, all arose in rejection and protest, to such extent that the hand of mercy bore Him to heaven. Today the people of the earth must ponder upon the previous Manifestations - what caused all the Prophets, Messengers, sincere ones and near ones to suffer at the hands of enemies. The Cause of the Qa’im - may our souls be a sacrifice for Him - was greater than all, and His tribulations more severe, for it was foretold that the most exalted among creation would flee from His word. Yet none became aware or understood the purpose. O Hashim! By the mighty Name of God, rend asunder the veils of allusions and the coverings of doubts - a rending whose sound the denizens of the Kingdom will hear. This Wronged One speaks for the sake of God: though most princes and divines have been and are in opposition, this Prisoner has arisen to manifest God’s Cause and to reveal that which He was commanded, and continues to this day with His pen alone to stand before the world and all peoples, speaking that which He was bidden and will continue to speak. The might of the rejectors and the clamor of the deniers have not and will not deter Him. Know thou the station of these days and arise to make up for what hath escaped thee. Say: […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the God of all in the world! I testify that I was heedless of the wonders of Thy remembrance and the mysteries Thou hast manifested in Thy days, in such wise that mine ears attained not unto the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen, and mine eyes beheld not the effulgences of the lights of Thine All-Glorious Horizon, until these days arrived wherein my heart, my sight, and my hearing were stirred with longing to hearken unto Thy most exalted Word, O Lord of all beings! Now dost Thou see me turning unto Thee, hoping for the wonders of Thy bounty and favors. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the ocean of Thy knowledge. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of him who was named Ali-Akbar, who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou and those who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken - that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. We have mentioned thee out of Our grace, and We mention thee out of Our loving-kindness. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the King of Kings. Convey My greetings unto the faces of My loved ones there and give them the glad-tidings of My mercy and My grace, for I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Protector of what was and what shall be. That land hath been named Paran in the presence of the Desired One. Blessed is it and blessed is he whose letter hath come before Us in these days. We shall soon answer him and his father and those who have believed in God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>O Joseph! Give thanks to the Beloved of the world Who hath mentioned thee, and likewise the souls mentioned in the letter. We make mention of thy father and thy brother. We seek forgiveness for them both and We beseech God to forgive them and to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His devoted servants. We counsel them to be steadfast in this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The End. Praise be to God! Upon each of the souls mentioned the rain of mercy hath descended - a rain whose flow shall never cease, for it hath descended from the heaven of God’s grace. O beloved of my heart! On behalf of this ephemeral one, convey greetings and salutations to his honor Mulla Yusuf-’Ali, upon him be 95 [Baha’u’llah]. It is incumbent upon all to remember and respect those who have suffered tribulations in the path of God, who have heard the taunts of the heedless, who have been imprisoned, and who have witnessed signs of wrath and anger from hostile faces. Even if some of them committed unseemly acts in prison, one should seek forgiveness for them, for in times of tribulation and hardship some cannot maintain their normal state - errors inevitably occur. However, verily our Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous, and He is the Pardoner, the Concealer, the Compassionate, the Kind, the Merciful. The servant beseecheth his Lord to protect all through His bounty, mercy and loving-kindness. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.</p>
<p>And regarding the mention of his honor Aqa Mirza Mahdi and his honor Mashhadi Ali, upon them be the glory of God, it was presented before the Face. This is what was revealed for them from the heaven of our Lord’s will, the All-Informed. His words, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Speaker</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Remember Me amongst My servants. We have remembered thee before and after, and have revealed for thee that from which all who have the sense of smell can detect the fragrance of My loving-kindness, My care and My mercy, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Be thou vocal in My praise, soaring in My atmosphere, serving My Cause, and holding fast unto the cord of My loving-kindness. I am, verily, the All-Commanding, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Thou hast been beneath the glances of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, as attesteth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon those who entered the prison for My sake and left it through My love, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O Ali! Upon thee be My mercy! Verily, We have mentioned thee in diverse stations and do mention thee at this hour. Be thou thankful and numbered with them that praise. Say: O my God and my Lord! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance, the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, the manifestations of Thy grace, the Dawning-Place of Thy revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and voiced in Thy praise amidst Thy creation, through the wisdom Thou hast sent down in Thy Books. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>This servant conveyeth greetings, glorification and salutations to each one, and beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness and the crown of submission and contentment.</p>
<p>As for the mention of the beloved of the heart, Aqa Muhammad-Javad and his kindred, upon them be the glory of God and His favors, it was presented before the presence of the Lord of Manifestation. Each one hath been blessed with the lights of the Sun of the mention of the Most Great Name. His is the praise and bounty in all conditions. After wondrous utterances and resplendent favors, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this most exalted Word. His word, exalted and mighty be He: O Javad! Upon thee be My Glory! The Wronged One remembereth thee and hath remembered thee before in such wise as hath borne witness before the faces of the world to the permanence of the dominion and the Kingdom. The Lord of nations beareth witness to this. Thank Him for this most great favor, then preserve it through My Name, the Omnipotent, the Mighty. We, verily, glorify and send Our greetings from this station upon thee and upon them that are with thee and thy kindred. Verily thy Lord is the All-Remembering, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>The favors and kindness of the Goal of the world’s desire toward them are truly beyond this servant’s mention. The servant beseecheth his Lord to aid him in serving the Cause as He strengthened him in the early days, and to write down for him from His Most Exalted Pen that which beseemeth His all-embracing bounty, His all-encompassing grace, and His pre-existing mercy. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of the cousins, especially Aqa Abdul-Baqi, upon him and them be the everlasting glory of God. It was presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. For each one particularly did the sun of grace and favor rise. The servant testifieth that they have attained unto the bounty and bestowal of our Lord. O beloved of my heart! Ye have witnessed the waves of the ocean of favor and beheld the effulgences of the Sun of grace. There was and is no need for mention by this evanescent one.</p>
<p>And as for the mention made of my beloved, Jinab-i-Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, after it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this word: O Samandar! Upon Ibn-i-Abhar be My glory! He hath ever been mentioned before the Face and regarded with the glance of favor. My name Mahdi, upon him be My mercy and My favors. Likewise hath Jinab-i-Amin repeatedly made mention of him in his petitions. Blessed is he and his father and his mother and those who are with him in this Cause whereby the thoughts of the nations were scattered, the structure of the world was shaken, and the hearts of those servants who broke the Covenant on the Day of Return were perturbed.</p>
<p>We send greetings to the friends of the land of Za, both men and women. Indeed, We have sent down verses unto them before, and in these days We have sent down unto them as a bounty from Our presence, that they may give thanks unto their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O people of Za! Rejoice in the favors of your Lord, the Most Glorious. He maketh mention of you from the Most Sublime Horizon in such wise as nothing can equal. He is verily the Compassionate, the Forgiving, the Merciful. God willing, may ye be enkindled with the fire of the love of God - an enkindlement which neither the oppression of the aggressors nor the ascendancy of the tyrants can quench. Take ye the chalices of prosperity in the name of God, glorified be His majesty, and drink, in spite of those who cast them behind their backs. These are days of joy, for the Beloved of the world and the Most Great Name is established upon the throne [of manifestation]. Speak ye in His Name, drink ye in remembrance of Him, and be ye occupied with His mention. Associate with one another and with all people with the utmost joy and fragrance, wisdom and utterance. Be ye never heedless of wisdom in any situation.</p>
<p>O son of Abhar! Upon thy father and upon thee and thy mother be My peace and My loving-kindness and My mercy. Remind My loved ones of that which We have sent down unto them from the Kingdom of My Will and the Heaven of My favor, and I am verily the Compassionate, the Kind, the Generous. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to them and to the friends of that land who are enkindled with the fire of the love of God and illumined with the light of the knowledge of God, and I express my utter powerlessness and nothingness, and I beseech God to grant them the blessing of attaining His presence. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Himmat-’Ali Khan, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, his mention hath ever been made in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court, and my beloved, the Trustee, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, hath repeatedly mentioned him in his letters which he hath sent to this servant. In these days, one Most Holy and Most Glorious Tablet hath been specifically revealed for him and was given to the beloved of the heart, His Holiness Haji Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God and His favors, to be forwarded, for he too hath repeatedly made mention of him in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and hath sought special favors for him from God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God, he hath attained unto that which is befitting in this day. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, and hope that He will manifest that which He hath ordained. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>At this time I was summoned into the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and after attaining the presence, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words: “O servant in attendance! We wish to make mention of Samandar, upon him be My glory, and those who are with him, both male and female, young and old. O servant in attendance! Although the kindred of Samandar have been and are mentioned in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court of the Lord of Destiny, We now desire to outwardly adorn them with the ornament of the Most Glorious Remembrance. Blessed are ye, O My handmaidens and leaves of the Tree of My love! Praise ye the Desired One of all worlds Who caused you to attain and aided you in that which most of the women of the world and the queens of the earth, despite their waiting, seeking, longing and yearning, remain veiled from. For years they followed vain imaginings and ran to churches and mosques in remembrance of the Friend, yet when the light of certainty dawned, they remained heedless and veiled. O Samandar! Convey My greetings to all the souls of that household, male and female, young and old, on behalf of the Wronged One, and gladden them with the favors of God, exalted be His glory. All have been and are under the shadow of His grace. Through divine love they have attained a great station. They have never been and will never be absent from His sight. They must be grateful for this great bounty and appear with the utmost joy and gladness. Blessed are they and happy are they.”</p>
<p>This servant also conveys greetings and salutations to each of the honored ladies and delight of the eyes. I beseech God to assist all His loved ones in that land to remain firm, steadfast and resolute in such wise that should all the world gather together and speak contrary to what God has ordained, they would regard them all as bubbles on the surface of water with no permanence. This indeed is the meaning of steadfastness that has been revealed in the Tablets from the Pen of God, both before and after. On one occasion these exalted words were heard from the Tongue of Grandeur: “O servant in attendance! Whosoever has, in the name of the Self-Subsisting, drunk from the Sealed Wine must fix his gaze solely upon the Supreme Horizon. This is the station of true unity. In this case, even if all souls who consider themselves assured, enkindled, firm and steadfast should, God forbid, turn away, no doubt would enter his mind nor would any misgiving seize him. Rather, he would find himself more firmly rooted, more steadfast, more powerful and more triumphant.”</p>
<p>This indeed is the station of steadfast souls. Those who are moved by every wind and changed by every word were not and are not worthy of this court. This servant and that Beloved One must pray that He may not deprive His loved ones in that land and other countries from the splendors of the Sun of Unity. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Glory, praise, spirit and laudation be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who were attracted by the call of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And praise be to God, the One, the Single, the Individual, the Self-Subsisting, the Powerful, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Almighty.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>

<p>=== END BH00121 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00122 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>The rain of divine mercy is pouring down and the verses are ever being revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, and by His very truth there hath appeared that which hath no equal, no likeness, and no peer. All things are voicing the remembrance of the Lord of Names, and the dwellers of heaven are celebrating with “Blessed be God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.” This is the Day whereof He saith: “Thou shalt see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they are not drunken: But dreadful will be the chastisement of God,” and “On that Day shall every woman that beareth a burden lay down her burden.” In truth, in the primary station are the people of the Bayan. By the life of our Lord and your Lord, our Beloved and your Beloved, none hath been seen like unto these heedless people. Though they have witnessed the waves of the ocean of utterance and beheld the dawning splendors of the morn of inner meanings, yet they have arisen in opposition in such wise as hath never been seen or heard. What have they understood from twelve hundred years of Shi’ih Islam that they should now again cling to the same vain imaginings?</p>
<p>I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to make His servants aware through both seen and unseen means, to grant them vision, to bestow wakefulness, to vouchsafe justice, to confer fairness. Can one imagine for this Most Great Announcement any veils or glory-clouds more manifest, more dominant, and more encompassing than those which cause every fair-minded soul to cry out “God is most evident,” “God is most great,” and “God is most glorious”? This is the Day whereof He saith: “They have eyes with which they see not,” until the end of His exalted Word. His is the command; He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. There is no God but Him, the Help in Peril, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God and the God of the seen and unseen, my Goal and the Goal of Him Who hath appeared in the garment of being! I beseech Thee to assist Thy loved ones to serve Thy Cause, then aid them through the signs of Thy grandeur and the standards of Thy sovereignty, then manifest through them that whereby Thy Cause may be exalted amongst Thy servants and Thy traces in Thy lands. Thou art, verily, powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Mighty One, and Thy remembrance is sweet to the taste of them that love Thee.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Thou seest Thy servant and he who loveth Thee (S.M.) who hath arisen to aid Thy Cause in days wherein agitation hath seized the dwellers of Thy earth and faces have been darkened through their turning away from Thy countenance. Strengthen, O my God, his limbs for the service of Thy Cause and Thy remembrance and [Thy praise]. Thou art, verily, the Strong, the Triumphant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Beloved of my heart! The letters which that loved one addressed to the beloved of the heart of His Holiness the Most Great Name and to this servant were each a garden adorned with the roses of truth and utterance and meaning and exposition, and each letter thereof was a speaking book and a manifest scroll. The fragrance of those roses transcendeth mention and description. After their perusal and examination, they were taken to the Most Exalted Station and Supreme Summit, presented before the Divine Throne, and were honored to be heard. His word, exalted be His majesty and mighty be His sovereignty:</p>
<p>In My Name that speaketh in all times […]</p>
<p>Today the Banner of Revelation hath been raised to its loftiest station, and the Standard proclaiming “Verily I am God” hath been planted before the faces of all mankind. The path of God is clear, the proof hath been sent down, and the evidences are manifest. Nevertheless, most of the people of the world remain heedless and veiled. By God’s life! That which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen is such that a single drop thereof would suffice to quicken the Concourse on High, how much more the dwellers of earth. This is the Kawthar of life that floweth between the fingers of the All-Merciful. In truth, these created beings have never been, nor are they now, capable of hearkening unto this Word that hath shone forth from the Dayspring of Revelation, nor are they worthy of recognizing it, save whom God willeth.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon His Countenance! Beseech God, exalted be His glory, to raise up and send forth through His perfect might such people as may become bearers of His Trust and guardians of the pearls of His wisdom. Say: O party of God! Ye are the knights in the arena of inner meanings and utterance. Arise with zeal and stand firm in service to His Cause, that perchance the helpless servants may not be afflicted with the vain imaginings of the past. They were worshippers of idle fancies yet counted themselves among the most learned of mankind. They were adorers of idols yet deemed themselves to be unitarians. Until now the true meaning of Divine Unity hath not been made manifest. Were the Most Exalted Pen to unveil but a little thereof, all would testify to their own polytheism. However, the Name “the Concealer” hath not withdrawn the hem of grace, and the Name “the All-Bountiful” hath not permitted justice to reach this station.</p>
<p>Blessed are they who reflect and observe what hath come to pass in the past. For whosoever becometh aware shall attain unto the choice sealed wine through the blessing of the Name “the Self-Subsisting” and shall be adorned with the ornament of supreme steadfastness. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the party of God and give them the glad tidings of the favors of the Beloved of the worlds. All are mentioned in His presence and have attained unto the grace of God, exalted be His glory. Say: O friends! Preserve the trust of the love of the Beloved of the worlds in His Name and keep it hidden from the treacherous and the thieves. Convey my greetings to all the people of that household. Give them the glad tidings of My grace, My mercy, and My loving-kindness. The children and the teacher are all remembered. Verily, He fulfilleth His promise and He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Samandar! It is best that we occupy ourselves with the mention of the Peerless Friend and pass beyond all that exists and is visible, that another realm may be spread out and another world appear. Say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! Separation from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness from Thee hath consumed me, as hath that which hath befallen Thee in Thy path. My God, my God! Mine ear desireth to hear that for which it was created; withhold it not from Thy melodies and Thy tones. And mine eye desireth to behold the effulgences of the lights of Thy countenance; deprive it not of that which Thou hast manifested unto it. My God, my God! Why do I hear the call of the servants but hear not Thy call, and see Thy creation but see not the Dawning-Place of Thy revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs? Blessed is he who hath inhaled the fragrance of Thy shirt and whom the breezes of Thy days have overtaken in such wise that he hath detached himself from all else beside Thee. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, by the kingdom of Thy utterance, and by the sea which no ships of the world can encompass, and by the ark which the waves of nations cannot hinder, to strengthen me in all conditions as Thou didst strengthen me before and wilt strengthen me hereafter. Then send down from the heaven of Thy mercy upon Thy servants that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and acquaint them with what Thou hast purposed for them through Thy bounty and grace, and guide them to Thy path which calleth out with the most exalted call in the morning and in the evening: “By God! I am the Straight Path and I am the Balance whereby all things small and great are weighed.” O Lord! Deprive not Thy servants of the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Uttermost End and the sound of Thy Most Exalted Pen. Verily Thou art He Who hath testified through Thy generosity to all created things, and through Thy grace to all beings. There is none other God but Thee, the Revealer of verses, the Lord of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Praise be to God that this servant, despite numerous occupations, was blessed to make mention of that Beloved. The comfort of man hath ever been in meeting with loved ones, and when this is not possible, mention serveth as a substitute, for through mention some measure of solace is obtained. Thus it hath been said that when the rose is veiled, man findeth solace in rosewater. He beseecheth the eternal Truth and hopeth that He may grant success and confirmation, that the fire of separation may be quenched by the water of the mention of reunion and attainment. In His hand is all authority; He confirmeth whom He willeth as a grace from His presence, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>As to the mention of the intention to pen words - each letter of which is truly a messenger of love - to the city of seekers, this was a wondrous matter, and the poetry too was most fitting. He beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that through the tears of that eye He may water the gardens of inner meanings, that the flowers of remembrance and utterance may be refreshed by the rain from the spring of the eyes of them that are nigh, and may be made manifest in the world. For the tears of the eye, countless stations have been ordained; they tell of the sovereign of love, they are the primary narrator and the secondary interpreter. The servant beseecheth his Lord to preserve it and extend it through the sea of His light and the effulgences of the lights of His manifestation. Verily, He is the Protector of the yearning ones and the One Who draweth nigh unto them that are brought nigh. Praise be to Him for His bestowal at this time.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of Jinab-i-Khalil, upon him be the glory of God and His favors - he did indeed turn towards God, hasten forward until he arrived, heard and witnessed. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Helper, the Generous. In truth, with the divine seal of God’s love and the fire of heavenly affection, he moved like a celestial telegraph of love. O beloved of my heart! Love accomplishes many things - before it lies the book of mysteries, it possesses the records of ruin and prosperity. It can make the rock abundant in bounty, ignite that which is extinguished, and with a single word make the inanimate flow and spread. The hand is His hand and the field is His field. Praise be to God, he arrived safely at the divine homeland, was present and observant, and after staying some days, returned as commanded. Divine favor assisted him, confirmation accompanied him, and heavenly support protected him until he attained the presence of the Most Great Throne. In such days, matters like these are counted among miracles, for despite the discord of the peoples of the world, the light of unity and harmony accomplished its work, as it did - all attained to good and returned. Happy is he and blessed is he.</p>
<p>Regarding the permission for Haji Muhammad Baqir, upon him be the glory of God, to come - what was written was presented to the Most Holy Court. These exalted words were revealed from the Dawning-Place of grace, the Source of verses. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof: “O Samandar! The Truth, exalted be His glory, has appeared to bestow upon all the honor of His presence and to adorn them with the ornaments of sanctification, detachment, trustworthiness, religion, chastity and that which benefits their souls. He has manifested Himself for the meeting, but the people have prevented those who desired Him from every distant quarter.” Due to the multitude of visitors, arrivals and seekers in the prison land, some discussions have arisen. Convey greetings from the Wronged One. We have mentioned him through Our grace with a mention before which all mention bows down. O Samandar! Give him glad tidings from Me. We beseech God to inscribe for him from the Pen of His Command the reward of His presence. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Let him strive that he may attain unto steadfastness, which after recognition and meeting is the foundation. O Samandar! Beseech God not to deprive His servants of the ornament of justice and equity. He is powerful and mighty over all things. Praise be to God, they turned towards Him, approached, and attained the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. This is a great bounty, by My Life, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Huququ’llah which they have taken trouble to deliver - this is not the first service that has appeared from your honor, as attested by the Pen of God, our Lord and your Lord. From the first days you have been engaged in service and speaking in praise and glorification. This is from the favor of our Lord and your Lord upon you. Verily, He is the Witness, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The papers also arrived. Whatever is entrusted to your honor, its execution is certain and requires nothing else. Regarding the remaining amount known to the beloved Ibn-i-Abhar, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, favor was shown, and what that beloved one wrote is correct and accepted before the Truth, for if it had been mentioned, clamor would have arisen.</p>
<p>Regarding the Leaf, your niece, upon her be the glory of God - praise be to God, she has arrived and attained the presence and is engaged in service in the sanctuary, and all are pleased with her - that is, the people of the pavilion of chastity and greatness. In this matter, let that beloved one be assured.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Baqi, upon whom be the Glory of God! Your mention hath been made before the Throne. This servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to you and all your kindred. At this moment, while engaged in penning these words in the presence of the Most Great Throne, these exalted words have issued forth from the Kingdom of the All-Merciful’s utterance: “O Samandar! Convey greetings to the people of God on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: A handful of transgressors in the world, having adorned their heads with white and green turbans, have purposed to lead astray the people of God. From the inception of Islam until the Day of Manifestation, all have wandered in the wilderness of idle fancies and strayed in the deserts of vain imaginings. Thus when the Finger of Power rent asunder the veil, the deeds of all and their fruits became clear and evident to all. When He willeth to unveil, no veil can conceal it, and when He willeth to conceal, no power in the world nor the will of nations can expose it. Nevertheless, some among the people of the Bayan have followed suit and set about to mislead the people, even as did the former people. It is incumbent and obligatory upon all to strive and protect the servants of God, lest they be deprived of the Day-Star of certitude through former idle fancies. Convey greetings from the True One to Abdul-Baqi. Each soul is mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and hath been blessed by the grace of the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they whom neither the doubts of the people of the Bayan nor the allusions of the people of the Furqan caused to slip, and who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged in His Most Great Prison. These are the people of God in all lands. Glory be upon them, upon their first and their last, their outward and their inward aspects.”</p>
<p>When mention was made of the people of God in that land, it was presented before the Throne, and each one was blessed with the mention of God, exalted be His glory. Happy are they! For some, wondrous and sublime Tablets have been revealed from the heaven of favor and sent forth. God willing, may all attain unto them. In these days, a letter was received from the beloved Amin, Haji Mirza Abu’l-Hasan, upon whom be the Glory of God and His favors, wherein he made mention of the beloved ones of that land and expressed great joy and satisfaction. This is what was again revealed for the friends of God whose names were mentioned. His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Muhammad (Darbagh)! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He maketh mention of thee with that which nothing in all creation can equal, and counseleth thee to show forth the Greater Steadfastness and that whereby the Word of God, the Lord of all worlds, may be exalted. O Ali Akbar! The Prisoner calleth thee from the precincts of the Prison, maketh mention of thee, and beareth thee glad tidings as a bounty from His presence, and commandeth thee to that which beseemeth the days of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Husayn! Thou didst attain unto My mention in the early days and on this Day wherein the people of the Bayan have risen up even as the people of the Furqan rose up against My harm, after I had come unto them from the Dayspring of proof with the standards of verses and the banners of clear evidences. Thus did their souls entice them, and they were recorded among the idolaters in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Samandar! We make mention of the sons of thy paternal and maternal uncles, as a token of Our grace. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. Convey unto them the greetings of the Wronged One and give them the glad tidings of My turning towards them and My remembrance of them in a Book which none hath comprehended save God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We have remembered them in numerous Tablets and have counseled them with that which behooveth them, and We counsel them now to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in this wondrous Remembrance. The clamor which We had foretold hath come to pass in the Land of Mystery and before it when the Light was shining from the horizon of Zawra wherein was diffused the fragrance of My luminous raiment. Thus hath the ocean of utterance surged and the sun of knowledge shone forth. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>All have been blessed with special favors and have partaken of the table of divine meanings. This evanescent servant beseecheth God - exalted be His glory - to aid them to recognize true divine unity, for had the people of old attained unto the effulgent rays of true divine unity, all would have been found submissive and humble on the Day of Manifestation. This is the Day of God wherein none is mentioned save Him. Blessed are they that know.</p>
<p>At an appropriate and beloved time, thy visit was accepted on thy behalf as desired. Well is it with you and me.</p>
<p>As for the testimony which flowed from thy heart, tongue and pen at the end of thy letter, it was granted the honor of being heard before His presence, and that which was revealed in response from the heaven of divine will is such that this servant is truly incapable of describing it. Pardon, pardon, pardon! Glory be to God! From what substance are those souls made who have hesitated in this Cause? In truth, it is divine wrath and the recompense of deeds that hath seized some. Verily, He is the Recompenser, the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of the loved ones of the land of ’Ishq in the letter of the spiritual beloved, His Holiness the Most Generous Name, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God - praise be to God, it was a spiritual glad tiding and a luminous remembrance. However, to those who drink the wine of divine love, both ease and hardship are beloved. Whatever occurs in the path of the Friend is beloved to the soul and the heart’s desire. They have been delivered from those tribulations; God willing, may they remain protected from the fire of the idolaters and transgressors. This servant conveyeth greetings and praise to all and seeketh divine confirmation and assistance for all. All letters which thou sendest to thy spiritual beloved are presented before the Divine Throne, and responses are requested. The purpose is that thou hast ever been and remaineth mentioned.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about the funds expended, yes, according to the command, if it can be found from any source it should be taken. And concerning what thou didst write: “Whatever is commanded, we are, God willing, obedient and content, especially in receiving funds which is a matter of obedience” - to the end of thy words - after this matter was presented in the Most Holy Court, this utterance was revealed from the Kingdom of proof - exalted and blessed be His words: “O Samandar! We bear witness that thy deceased and elevated father and thou have not been remiss in serving the Cause. Ye have obeyed whatever was commanded and acted for the sake of God, for the love of God, and in the path of God. God willing, mayest thou ever drink of this Kawthar and partake of this choice wine. Nothing can equal the testimony of thy Lord. We praise God, exalted be He, with thy tongue and thank Him with His tongue, that it may be a treasure and honor for thee throughout the duration of the Kingdom and the realm of heaven.”</p>
<p>The petition of the nephew of the late, ascended Zia - upon him be the Glory of God and His mercy - was received, and several months ago a response descended from the heaven of divine will and was sent. Regarding [Yakan] - may God the Exalted strengthen him - what they wrote was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and a wondrous and exalted Tablet was specifically revealed for him and sent. His blessed and exalted Word states: “When he recognized, he soared on wings of longing unto God, the Lord of the Day of Meeting.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant is truly bewildered by that which hath been manifested and made evident from the exalted Truth, and likewise by the conditions of the people. At all times he beseecheth his Lord, the All-Merciful, to assist His servants to recognize what He hath manifested through His grace, His generosity and His favors. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Some names that were mentioned in this letter were presented before the countenance of the Lord of the worlds, and each received their portion as befitting from the ocean of grace. Blessed are they that drink thereof.</p>
<p>This is what was sent down from the heaven of the providence of our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. His word, exalted be His glory, states: “O Muhammad-’Ali! There came before the Presence a leaf wherein was thy mention. We have mentioned thee with a mention that all the mentions of the world cannot equal, and We counsel thee to manifest the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby the Names were shaken, as were the divines and jurisprudents of the earth. Thus hath the Sun of Grace revealed its favors that thou mayest be thankful and be of those who render praise.”</p>
<p>“O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Tahmasb, that he may rejoice in the mention of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, who hath turned toward Him from the direction of His Most Great Prison, and mentioned him in such wise that the near ones perceive therefrom the fragrance of the loving-kindness of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.”</p>
<p>“And We make mention of the teacher whom We mentioned before and gave him glad tidings of the favors of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Muhammad-Taqi! The Face of Him Who was wronged hath turned toward thee and calleth thee to that which will draw thee nigh unto the Supreme Horizon and will adorn thee with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.”</p>
<p>Concerning the mention of Haji Baba, upon whom be the Glory of God, after these sublime words were submitted, there dawned from the Dayspring of Divine Revelation and Inspiration these words–magnified be His glory: “O Haji Baba! The Divine Lamp is luminous and bright, and the Sun of inner meanings is radiant and manifest. The tongue of utterance speaks at all times, and the ocean of proof surges before all faces. Nevertheless, all remain heedless and deprived, save whom God willeth. Reflect upon the people of the Bayan: They have newly arranged their turbans, green and white, and ascend the pulpits. They desire to establish a party like unto the Shi’ih party in the earth. By God’s life! The people of justice lament, and the manifestations of equity weep. Have they not reflected upon the fruits of the former party’s deeds? For they committed such acts as prevented eyes from beholding and ears from hearing. That party, both learned and ignorant, perpetrated what no other party had ever done, and committed that from which Satan himself fled. We beseech God to protect His servants. In brief, the divines of Iran and the opposers among the people of the Bayan are deprived of the lights of the Sun of true divine unity. More than this cannot be disclosed. Say: Fear God, and follow not your idle fancies. This is a Day wherein naught is mentioned save God, your Lord and your Goal, and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land on behalf of the Wronged One, and summon them to the most great steadfastness. Glory be upon thee and upon whosoever hath cast away the world, holding fast to the cord of God, the Strong, and His mighty Cause.”</p>
<p>This evanescent one conveys greetings to each one. All must, through God’s grace, bounty and aid, hold fast to unity and harmony, and through consultation strive to exalt the Word of God, expending mighty efforts therein.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Andalib, upon whom be the Glory of God. His petitions have repeatedly reached the Most Holy Court, and in these days a Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to him. At this moment these manifest verses were revealed from the heaven of God’s grace–blessed and exalted be He: “O Samandar! Andalib, upon whom be My glory, hath been striving and endeavoring to exalt the Word night and day. This is the testimony of the Most Exalted Pen concerning him. Give him the glad tidings of My grace, My bounty, and My turning towards him. We beseech God to adorn him with such an ornament that all may behold from him the light of sanctity. By God’s life! For long periods this Wronged One was grief-stricken, until Divine grace seized him and generosity turned toward him. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen him and aid him with what He loveth and pleaseth. He hath ever been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, and continueth to be so.”</p>
<p>This evanescent servant conveys greetings to him and beseeches the Mighty God to strengthen him to make mention and praise of Him and to aid His Cause. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Another submission: The beloved sister of His Holiness the Name of Generosity (Ismu’l-Jud), upon whom be 966 [the Glory of God] the Most Glorious, together with her son, upon them both be the Glory of God, have been granted permission to turn towards the Most Holy Court. Thus hath shone forth the sun of permission from the horizon of our Lord’s grace, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. I beseech and implore the Mighty God to strengthen them in all conditions, grant them success, and through His perfect power arrange circumstances whereby they may at all times attain unto His wondrous and sublime bounties.</p>
<p>We verily are the Comforter, the All-Knowing. We have desired to make mention of Our handmaiden who attained to the recognition of her Lord before her ascension, and after her ascension was blessed with the Kawthar of her Lord’s gracious favors, the Kind, the All-Merciful. We testify that she turned to God and believed when men were in manifest rejection. She drank the choice wine of recognition from the hand of her Lord’s bounty, the All-Merciful, and mention of her was recorded by the Pen of Revelation when the Wronged One was in His mighty prison. When she ascended, the Concourse on High perceived from her the sweet fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of all beings. Blessed is she and joy be unto her! She attained unto mention in her days and unto the favors of her Lord after her ascension. We beseech God to send down upon her from the heaven of grace and bounty at all times that which befitteth His generosity, His grace and His bounty, which have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We console Our servant Abdul-Husayn, who was mentioned in the early days before God, the Lord of all mankind. We make mention of his son and daughter and counsel them to be patient in what hath come upon them in the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We console those who were with them, as a token of Our grace, for verily We are the Almighty, the Forgiving, the Merciful. The glory from Us be upon them all.</p>
<p>Blessed is she, again blessed is she, for she hath been honored with mention by the Supreme Pen. In life she was adorned with His love, and in death she ascended with His love. Grace, bounty and favor are within His mighty grasp; He bestoweth them upon whomsoever He willeth. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Concerning the late Aqa Morteza-Qoli, upon him be the glory of God and His mercy, the mere fact that he associated with that beloved one and entered that house and showed forth love is sufficient. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak concerning him, and after being submitted before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sublime words were revealed - exalted be His utterance and glorified His proof:</p>
<p>“O Samandar! Although that deceased one did not act according to divine counsels, yet in his final years signs of love were manifest from him, and his turning to your house, his presence, and his seeking - all bear witness to his recognition. Therefore he has been adorned with the grace of God, exalted be His glory, and He forgave him through His bounty, and purified him from the defilement of the world, and ordained for him a station beneath the shade of His chosen ones. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He shall not be asked of His doings. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Though he was not enkindled as befitted, yet from time to time he was mindful, and by the testimony of the Supreme Pen he possessed love to a certain degree. Therefore the all-encompassing mercy embraced him. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Bountiful, the Generous, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Special mention that I conveyed your humility, submissiveness, remembrance and praise to the Holy Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps. Each one manifested countless favors, especially mentioning and showing kindness to you. Likewise, the denizens of the pavilion of infallibility and grandeur all made mention of that beloved one and his household. God willing, this letter will reach you and the hidden, recorded favors will become manifest and evident.</p>
<p>Glory, remembrance and praise be upon your honor, upon those with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>10th of Jumada al-Thani 1303</p>
<p>=== END BH00122 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00123 ===</p>
<p>O Khudadad son of Nasir, upon him be the Glory of God</p>
<p>In the month of Shawwal 1298</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Wondrous, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord</p>
<p>Praise sanctified above tongue and utterance beseemeth the most holy court of that One Who begetteth not nor is begotten, Who through the outpourings of the ocean of His will hath in every age and cycle manifested a Cause as required, and made all things dependent upon and connected with the Most Great Manifestation. Every Book is an expression of the dawning rays of the Sun of Truth, and every Scripture a mention of the outpourings of the ocean of grace. All books herald this most mighty, most holy, most exalted Day, and all Messengers speak in praise of this most glorious, most ancient, most resplendent Revelation. Though all the Manifestations of the Cause were indeed related unto God and their days are in one sense mentioned as the Days of God, yet the seeing eye perceiveth that this wondrous Day is specially reserved for the appearance of the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret. All books bear witness to this most glorious, most mighty, most holy, most exalted station.</p>
<p>The purpose of these words is that the sanctified, assured souls who today have quaffed the wine of mystical knowledge and are known throughout the contingent world by the name of the All-Merciful - their station and rank may become evident and manifest to all peoples. I swear by the Beloved of the world that in this Day the steadfast and upright souls are mentioned before God as pearls of the ocean of names and are recorded by the Most Exalted Pen as letters of the Book.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through the sweetness of Whose utterance the people of Thy kingdom were drawn unto Thee, and through the lights of the Sun of Whose countenance the earth and all who dwell therein were illumined. I beseech Thee, O Lord of eternity, by the Most Great Name, to give Thy loved ones to drink from the Kawthar of Thy bounty in such wise that neither the conditions of those who have turned away from Thy Beauty, nor the doubts of the chiefs among Thy servants who lay claim to knowledge without clear proof from Thee or testimony from Thy presence, shall keep them back. They have placed mountains of ignorance upon their heads and pride themselves therein, turning away from the Dayspring of Thy knowledge, the Dawning-Place of Thy wisdom, the Manifestation of Thy signs, and the Source of Thy clear tokens.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, O my God, that they have made their turbans as snares for the weak among Thy creatures. O Lord! Thou seest Thy chosen ones arising to serve Thee on this Day wherein the Sun of Thy justice is hidden behind clouds of oppression raised by those who frequent the mosques for Thy remembrance and praise, yet deny Him through Whose name the mosques, temples and sanctuaries were raised up, and through Whose advent every land and lofty station was honored. O Lord! Make known unto Thy servants that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and illumine their eyes with the lights of their recognition in Thy days. O Lord! Thou art the Mighty, the Possessor of great strength. Write down for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will aid them in Thy remembrance and praise every morn and eve. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>And I pray and send greetings upon those who heard the Call and hastened unto Thee, O Lord of Names! These are servants who cast aside their own wishes and desires, taking hold of that which Thou didst command them in Thy Book. O Lord! Make their conditions manifest unto Thy creatures and the people of Thy kingdom, then make them hands of Thy Cause amongst Thy creation. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And furthermore, this servant submits that your letter dated the night of the 9th of Jamadiyu’th-Thani was received, causing fresh joy and boundless delight. Praise be to God that the fragrance of “all deeds have become as one flower in the Day of God” wafts from it, for every word of yours indicates the unity, harmony and steadfastness of God’s loved ones. Blessed are they, and theirs is the station of security in both beginning and end. God willing, may all attain this lofty, most exalted station and remain firm in it. The pearls of inner meanings must be guarded against thieves; assured souls must exert mighty efforts to preserve and protect them. After observing your letter and reading and comprehending its contents, I turned toward the Holy Place that transcends mention and utterance, and after gaining presence and permission, presented it before His face. Then the Countenance of the Beloved turned toward me with cheerfulness and smiles, as though the lights of divine good-pleasure were shining from the face of our Goal and the Goal of all who are in the heavens and earth. He said, exalted be His glory: “Praise be to God that thou hast been illumined by the lights of the divine Dayspring and hast attained unto the hearing of the Most Sweet Call. Thou didst hear and turn unto Him. It is as though God’s breeze in His days hath caused thee to arise in His remembrance and praise amongst His creatures. This is a Day which the Most Great Spirit heralded, calling out His name in the wilderness of longing. They who drink the choice wine must observe wisdom and engage in teaching the Cause, holding fast in all matters to the cord of consultation and clinging to the hem of kindliness, that the children of the age may, through the loving-kindness and affection of God’s wise ones, attain unto maturity and be granted perfect health.” This blessed word hath been revealed and sent down by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book: “The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Consultation increaseth awareness and transformeth conjecture into certitude. It is a shining light in the dark world - it guideth and directeth. For everything there hath been and shall be a state of maturity and perfection. The maturity and manifestation of understanding becometh evident through consultation.” And this blessed word hath also been inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book: “Understanding is like heaven, and forbearance and godliness are its sun and moon. By the Sun of Truth! For understanding there hath not been nor shall be a mightier host than these two.” O Khudadad! We have made mention of thee in the beginning and the return, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord and be filled with manifest joy. Thou hast attained unto God’s traces and His days - this is naught but a mighty favor. Convey My greetings to My loved ones, then mention to them that which My Pen hath uttered. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. We have created them, manifested them, taught them and caused them to know this favor which every trusted Messenger heralded. We command them to show forth the supreme steadfastness in this Day before which centuries and ages have bowed down. To this testifieth he who hath acknowledged that which God hath acknowledged in His perspicuous Book. Say: O friends! Today ye must all arise to that which will cause unity and harmony. Every decayed bone is moved by the motion of the Supreme Pen and is enabled to speak through the choice wine of the utterance of the Beloved of all possibility. God willing, may each one be as a spirit for the bodies of the servants and as a light for the lands. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones in thy region and upon thy wife and upon those women who have believed in God, the Single One, the All-Informed. The End.</p>
<p>In truth this evanescent servant has been and continues to be immeasurably gladdened by mention of your unity and the fellowship and concord of God’s loved ones. Praise be to God that He has confirmed you. Indeed, your letters are bearers of glad tidings, for that which today causes the exaltation of God’s Word is the unity and concord of His loved ones and chosen ones, and in every letter these glad tidings arrive from you. We beseech Him, exalted be His glory, both you and this evanescent one, that He may illumine all lands with this most glorious and most holy light. Verily He is the Powerful, verily He is the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Holy Tablets, that they reached their recipients with utmost honor - the recompense for these deeds rests with Him, exalted be His glory. God willing, may He cause you to succeed day by day in serving His Cause. We beseech Him, exalted be His glory, to assist His loved ones in comprehending the sweetness of His verses. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Ridvan and the gathering of God’s loved ones in various meetings, and mention of their attraction and enthusiasm and longing and yearning and their unity and concord - while these passages were being presented, the Ancient Beauty smiled and said: “O servant present! He is indeed among those who have arisen to serve the Cause. Therefore, beseech God to send down upon him that which lay hidden in the treasuries of His grace and favor and kindness. By My life! He hath mentioned that which hath brought Me joy. This sufficeth him, by My Name, the All-Encompassing over all names.”</p>
<p>And concerning your mention that the honored Azizu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, after receiving the Blessed Tablet, hosted two units of the divine friends in the home of Mulla ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God - these sacred deeds have truly been and continue to be the cause of the propagation of God’s Cause. Do not consider the outward appearance, for one day while engaged in recording the verses being revealed in the presence of His Glory, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these words: “O servant in attendance! Even while the door is closed, the divine verses nevertheless encompass and pervade the world with their fragrance, for the Word has been and remains penetrating. The winds are most penetrating and permeate the veins of the earth, adorning all things according to their needs with the ornament of colors by His firm command. The appearance of colors depends upon His wisdom and the True Director’s arrangement, yet its penetration is manifested through the Word, and before its penetrating power the Word itself becomes as nothing. Exalted, exalted be its sovereignty! Exalted, exalted be its penetrating power! Exalted, exalted be its might and authority!” And likewise, at another time this blessed word was heard from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. He said: “If a breath is released by anyone for the sake of God, that breath has been and will be influential in the world.” May you and the other friends be assisted and confirmed in that which God loves. In any case, the details of the feast of the honored Azizu’llah, upon him be the glory of God, and the tribulation that befell him in the path, all these matters were presented before His countenance. These manifest verses were revealed from the Dawning-Place of the Will of the Lord of Names and Attributes. His mighty utterance declares: “O Aziz! All the sages, scholars, mystics, divines and princes were awaiting this blessed Day, and some monarchs even arranged treasuries in the name of the Qa’im, and in these days in India they are specifically collecting wealth in His name. Nevertheless, on the day when the Sun of Manifestation rose from that horizon and the Water of Life flowed from the right hand of the Throne of the All-Merciful, all were found heedless, veiled and deprived. But thou, through divine grace, hast attained unto it. By the life of God! Ye have attained to such a station that were its rank and station to be revealed in the world, all would exclaim: ‘Blessed be God, the Revealer of this glorious scene!’ Reflect upon divine power, and likewise upon His grace. They counted you among the lowliest of servants, yet now through God’s favor ye are mentioned as the most exalted, most honored, most knowledgeable and most enlightened of servants in God’s presence. Previously it was announced: ‘We wish to show favor unto those who were brought low in the land and to make them leaders and make them the inheritors.’ This utterance has repeatedly flowed from the tongue of the All-Merciful as a favor to you and those with you. Preserve this most mighty, most holy and most exalted station through the name of your Lord, the Lord of all beings. We have [mentioned] all the friends of that land at this time; all are adorned with the ornament of His favor. Verily, We give them the glad-tidings of this wondrous bounty.”</p>
<p>We make mention of ’Ali and Kazim, that they may rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance. We have mentioned them before, and We make mention of those who have taken hold of the Book of God with the power that is from Him and acted in accordance with that which they were commanded by the Mighty, the Wise. The praise of God and His bounty and favor are at such a station that this servant hath not, nor ever had, the capacity to make mention thereof. With utmost clarity and explicitness have they manifested their favor. With a hundred thousand tongues must we give thanks to the Beloved of all existence that He hath, from the Supreme Pen, named that honored one and the others as the sons of the Friend and the heirs of Him Who conversed with God. The tribulation that hath befallen the dear one, upon him be the Glory of God, is a sign of acceptance. Blessed is he! God willing, may ye all be seen to be outwardly and inwardly in harmony and unity. All the friends, whether they be of the branches, the leaves, or the fruits, are mentioned in one station. This is naught but a great bounty.</p>
<p>As to what was mentioned regarding the matter of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar being conducted in two places - one in the home of Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God, and one in the home of the dear one, upon him be the Glory of God - these matters were also presented. This is what the Tongue of the Intended One hath spoken in reply to them both: Let them praise their Lord, for He hath caused them to hear, and hath acquainted them with His Cause, and hath made them speak, and hath aided them to make mention of His mighty and wondrous Name. We make mention of Kazim and his father who spent what he possessed in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. He attained unto the presence of God and arose to serve the Cause of his Lord with such steadfastness as caused the tongues of those near unto God to speak forth in praise. Blessed is He Who aided him and caused him to arise for the triumph of His Cause and enabled him to speak that which the Tongue of Grandeur had spoken. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. O Kazim! Know thou the station of thy father and walk in his footsteps, as bidden by God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. We have loved him and made mention of him in diverse places with such mention as its fragrance will not cease to perfume the realm of earth and heaven. And We make mention of the dear one once again and counsel him with that which its fragrance will diffuse between earth and heaven. Thus hath the Pen spoken while the Wronged One was in an inaccessible prison.</p>
<p>As to what ye wrote concerning Aqa Mulla ’Ali, upon him be all My most glorious Glory, that he hath intended to conduct it in these days - this matter is most beloved. Praise be to God that he hath been assisted to serve and teach the Cause of God and hath been and continues to be under the glances of God’s favor, exalted be His glory. In all matters, they who drink the choice wine of inner meanings must observe wisdom. For instance, regarding the matter of the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar which was revealed in the Most Holy Book and whose ordinance hath been put into effect in that land and hath been accepted - if it should cause commotion and excitement among the evil-doers, its prevention and suspension are permissible. This matter hath been mentioned that all may know that wisdom, in the presence of the Throne, taketh precedence over all things. The request of this evanescent one to those souls who are turned towards that blessed and sublime station is that they forget not this nothing-worthy servant and remember him with such remembrance that perchance I may be counted among the partners and be recorded among those who make mention in the Perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O Baqir! Hear, hear this, My most sweet call, raised from the prison of ’Akka. By My life, by it the heart of every Prophet took wing and the countenance of every trusted Messenger was illumined. O Baqir! Behold, behold this, My face, which I have manifested to My servants. Verily it hath turned toward thee from this exalted station. O Baqir! By My life, this is the Day of hearkening, this is the Day of witnessing and meeting, and this is the Day of utterance. Blessed is he who hath spoken My most exalted Word, and heard My most great verses, and witnessed My most high horizon. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the heaven of knowledge with the luminary of utterance. Happy is he who hath recognized and witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>Indeed, these wondrous and transcendent verses are as a spirit for the body of the world - but what body is worthy to receive this spirit and deserving of this cherished mention from the eternal sovereign! We ever beseech Him not to deprive any from the ocean of His grace. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote regarding asking on behalf of yourself and other friends when in the presence of the Countenance of the Adored One, and attaining on their behalf - this matter, after being presented, was honored with acceptance and adorned with permission. At that very moment, this servant attained to visitation and circumambulation on your behalf of the Goal of all worlds. Happy are you and blessed am I.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have remembered thee before, and before that before, and in this hour when the Tongue of the Wronged One speaketh in the Most Great Prison amidst the peoples - the Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords. The Most Exalted Pen hath testified that thou didst turn to God, the Lord of all beings, when He appeared and manifested what He desired. By God’s life! Neither the treasures of the world nor all that the peoples possess can equal this testimony. To this doth testify the Most Great Book, which proclaimeth: There is no God but I, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of life in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and for having attained that which most of the servants have not attained. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for having remembered thee and caused thee to know and to speak and guided thee to the straight path. Say:[…]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou through Whose Name the mountains were moved and the Day of Reckoning appeared! I beseech Thee by the Name through which the Trump was sounded, the Bugle was blown, and they that lay in their graves arose, to aid me in serving Thy Cause, to enable me to do that which befitteth Thy days, and to teach me that which lay hidden in the treasuries of Thy knowledge. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy most exalted horizon and gazing toward Thy direction, O Thou Who art the Lord of Names and the Creator of heaven! I beseech Thee by Thy Manifestation, Thy appearance, Thy uprising and Thy establishment, to ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who cast away the cups of the world and took the cup of steadfastness through Thy Name and Thy Command. O my Lord! I am the poor and needy one, and Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Bountiful. I have hastened from the multitudes unto Thee, have placed my trust in Thee, and have held fast unto Thy cord. Deal with me as beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty, the ocean of Thy grace and the sun of Thy generosity. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>Some time ago Ibn-i-Ismu’llah’ul-Asdaq, Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Ali-Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, sent a letter to this servant mentioning Haji Muhammad, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], and had beseeched God, exalted be His glory, that some token of favor be shown regarding him. Therefore wondrous and sublime verses were revealed and sent that his eyes and the eyes of all who are in the heavens and earth might be consoled thereby. And before this, this evanescent one had heard mention of him, as was submitted, from the Tongue of Grandeur time and again. God willing, may he abide secure and at rest beneath the canopies of grace. This evanescent one also offers him greetings that transcend any mention from this evanescent one.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about Ibn-i-Shahid, upon them both be the Glory of God, that he had requested his mention be submitted at the Most Holy Court, and likewise had asked that he not be left to himself in any circumstance - truly this mention is most beloved, for the fragrance of humility, submissiveness, resignation, contentment, lowliness and supplication wafts from it. And this is a station wherein whosoever attains unto it and remains steadfast therein is recorded in the Crimson Book by the Supreme Concourse. In any case, these matters were also submitted at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His glory: God willing, may they assist the transcendent Truth through wisdom, utterance, deeds and character. They have ever been and continue to be mentioned at the Most Holy Court. It behooveth him to praise God, his Lord, and to thank Him by night and day. Verily We have mentioned him and his father in a Book sent down in truth from God, the Lord of the worlds, and We send Our greetings unto him from this Most Holy, Most Mighty, Most Great, Most Wondrous Station.</p>
<p>And concerning the mention you made of Mirza Abu’l-Hassan, upon him be the Glory of God, a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for him. God willing, may he attain thereunto.</p>
<p>O Ali! Praise be to God that thou hast succeeded in serving the Cause, and on a day when all were veiled by the doubts and fancies of their imaginations, thou didst find thy way to the straight path, attain unto the highest horizon, and reach that which hath been the ultimate purpose of the divine Books of the past and of the future. Preserve this most exalted station through the name of the Best-Beloved of the world. This is a day wherein man can take possession of that which neither decline shall seize nor annihilation pursue, and which shall know neither change nor alteration. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee, then render thanks unto God for this great bounty. Hold thou fast, under all conditions, to the teaching of thy Lord’s Cause with the wisdom that hath been sent down in a perspicuous Tablet.</p>
<p>O Ishaq! We made mention of thee before, and at this hour when the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth that there is none other God but Me, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Say: O my God and the God of all names, my Creator and the Creator of the heavens, my Best-Beloved and the Best-Beloved of all who dwell in the kingdoms of creation! I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy Cause, the light of Thy countenance, the rain from the clouds of Thy mercy, and the suns in the heaven of Thy manifestation, to ordain for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Then decree for me that which shall aid me in the service of Thy Cause. Verily, Thou knowest what draweth me near and what holdeth me back, what harmeth and what benefiteth me. I am unaware and ignorant of that which lieth within Thy knowledge. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thou seest me, O my Best-Beloved, turning unto Thee and clinging to Thee. Write down for me, therefore, that which befitteth my poverty and beseemeth Thy wealth, that which my powerlessness deserveth and is worthy of Thy might, Thy power and Thy sovereignty. O Lord! I have turned my face unto Thy face and have cast my self, my spirit, my heart and all that Thou hast given me before Thy Cause. Do as Thou willest through Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O son of Musa! Thy name hath attained unto the Most Great Horizon and the Lord of Destiny hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in such wise that thy remembrance shall endure throughout the eternity of My Most Beauteous Names. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who didst call me while I was in prison amidst the heedless ones!”</p>
<p>O son of Musa! I swear by the Sun of the heaven of divine wisdom, wert thou to taste the sweetness of tribulation in the path of God, thou wouldst forsake all the pleasures of the world and cleave unto it. The taunts of the idolaters and the turning away of the opposers themselves bear witness that thou hast detached thyself from creation and clung unto the Truth. These two are heralds that at every moment bring thee tidings that thou hast, from time immemorial, been associated with the chosen ones of God.</p>
<p>O Khudadad, O son of Musa! I swear by the Lord of Names that no Prophet or Messenger hath appeared in the world except that He hearkened unto the taunts of His people and witnessed the turning away of the opposers. God willing, thou shalt associate with the people of the world with the utmost joy and radiance in the path of the Best-Beloved of the worlds. These fleeting days were not and are not worthy. Soon shall appear in the earth that which hath been sent down in the Book, as a command from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Taqi! Thou hast attained unto that which, hadst thou expended all the treasures of the world, thou wouldst not have attained unto its like. Reflect upon the people of the earth: they build mosques, temples, churches, and bridges for the perpetuation of name and remembrance, and likewise they desire children for the perpetuation of remembrance and the reward they have in mind, if it be righteous. And these means are known to every person of understanding to be subject to perishing. But the word which hath been revealed for thee from the Supreme Pen shall endure throughout the eternity of the kingdom and the dominion, and shall shine even as the sun from the horizon of the heaven of the Book. By the life of God! It hath been and shall ever be more exalted than a hundred thousand children and than the treasures of the earth. It behooveth every soul who hath attained unto the Word of God to know its station and to preserve it through the name of his Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. We make mention of thy wife in this station and send greetings upon her. Blessed is she inasmuch as she hath heard and responded to her Lord, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We give her the glad-tidings that My Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of her. Verily, thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst write concerning Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God, it was presented before the Throne. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken: God willing, may he be blessed with divine favor and be detached and free from creation. As he seeketh with the utmost endeavor to exalt the Word and to teach the Cause, God willing, he shall attain unto the reward thereof. O Khudadad! Make mention of him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of My favor, My mercy, and My tender care which have preceded existence.</p>
<p>When mention was made of Jinab-i-Shahvirdi and Jinab-i-Asadu’llah and Ra?matu’llah and others upon them be Baha’u’llah, who were mentioned in your letter and who partook of the choice wine of the All-Merciful’s mercy in these most excellent days, all were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. The Sun of loving-kindness shone upon each one particularly. Blessed are they, inasmuch as their names have attained to the honor of being heard by Him Who is our Goal and their Goal, our Object of worship and their Object of worship, and the Object of worship of all who are in the heavens and the earth. All have attained to the wondrous favors of His utterance and have received their portion and share from the ocean of His mercy. How blessed and wholesome it is for them!</p>
<p>As to your request for forgiveness from the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness, it was presented, and this is what the Tongue of the Desired One spoke: “Thou art he who hath attained to God’s grace and mercy. Verily He hath aided thee, and guided thee, and drawn thee nigh, and caused thee to speak, and awakened thee, and raised thee up to serve His mighty Cause. Praise be to God! The mercy, compassion and loving-kindness of God have encompassed thee and continue to encompass thee. Rejoice thou in this wondrous favor. Praise be unto Him Who hath spoken the truth from His mighty and lofty station.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the letters that were sent to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad-’Ali-i-Qa’ini, upon him be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, were presented before the Throne, and repeatedly were those names honored with divine mention, loving-kindness and compassion. Likewise, the letter which Jinab-i-’Azizu’llah wrote to Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Muhammad, upon him be all His most glorious Glory, was presented at the Most Holy Court and was honored to be heard. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, that He may aid all who are in the world to perceive the fragrances of His verses and to catch the sweet scent of His raiment, for if they were to attain unto even less than a hair’s breadth thereof, all would turn towards the Dayspring of Light and the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation. In truth, this couplet which was formerly uttered pertaineth to these days:</p>
<p>“If but a whiff of its sweet scents were wafted in the East,</p>
<p>Even one in the West with a cold would regain his sense of smell.”</p>
<p>From this evanescent one to those who drink the choice wine of inner meanings, the conveying of wondrous greetings dependeth upon your honor’s kindness. The Glory be upon you and upon those who have cast away all else and taken hold of that which beseemeth the Day of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>=== END BH00123 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00124 ===</p>
<p>Beloved of my heart and soul, may Ibn Ism’ullah al-Asdaq, upon them both be all His most glorious glory, observe:</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Unto God, the Lord of all beings, do I bewail my grief and sorrow. Affairs have been overturned, countries have been thrown into turmoil, and Islam has been weakened therein. Enemies have surrounded it, and it stands besieged. It behooveth that party, therefore, to supplicate God morning and evening, and to beseech Him to assist all Muslims in that which He loveth and is pleased with, to raise them up through His command and sovereignty, to make known to them that which will exalt their stations, to transform their abasement into glory, their poverty into wealth, their ruin into prosperity, their agitation into tranquility, and their fear into peace and security. Verily, He is the All-Merciful; there is none other God but Him, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! The fire of heedlessness hath encompassed the world, and whatsoever God, exalted be His glory, had formerly announced in the Books and Scriptures hath all become manifest and evident. The calamities and tribulations of the earth have become like ordinary food - every day they arrive. On one side calamities, on another side unjust wars, oppressive artillery, and rebellious, tyrannical rifles have encompassed the world and its people, yet none hath discovered the cause and reason thereof. In brief, the religion of God is seen like a spiritual bird beneath the talons of pharaohs, or beneath the claws of beasts. Alexandria, which was adorned with all the ornaments of the world, was seen naked and bare within mere hours - nay rather, ruined and desolate. There is no power nor strength except in God. The recompense of deeds hath become embodied and assumed various forms. They flee, but there is no refuge; they cry for help, but it is not the time for help; they run, but there is no escape. May God, exalted be His glory, grant the grace that man might at least know and become aware from what cause these things have been generated and from what deed they have appeared. Alas, alas! Verily, deeds have blocked the gate of knowledge. Abominable deeds have barred the path of understanding and prevented man from awareness. It is hoped that after this earthquake may come tranquility, and after this agitation of the earth may come peace. In these days this exalted word was heard from the tongue of the Lord of Names - exalted be His utterance: “O servant who art present! In these days the earth, time, and heaven - each one expresseth its tidings with two tongues.” End quote.</p>
<p>For the people of these parts, comfort and ease are non-existent. The matter hath reached such a pass that the sending of post and letters hath become difficult, nay, most difficult. And now it is intended that this letter be taken to Haifa. God alone knoweth in what manner and when it shall arrive. Since a response to the letter of that spiritual beloved was necessary, therefore this servant writeth briefly and hopeth it will arrive. The letter of that beloved one, dated the twenty-sixth of Jamadiyu’th-Thani, arrived previously. It was as though it were a dove from the city of faithfulness that arrived bearing letters of love, affection, longing, and yearning. Its song brought joy and its cooing increased ardor. It is hoped that God, exalted be His glory, will gather the wanderers of the realm of unity beneath the canopies of His grace. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>As to what you wrote concerning the dispatch of Aqa Siyyid ?adiq and his brother, upon them be the glory of God and His loving-kindness, this was most welcome and praiseworthy indeed. Today is the day of pure deeds and service to the Cause, that perchance the lights of goodly character may encompass the world and the hosts of righteous acts may capture heedless hearts and draw them to the direction of awareness. All that you wrote regarding these matters was presented. He said: “Praise be to God that they have been assisted to serve and educate the servants. God willing, may all attain to that which is intended, namely that all should move for the sake of God and not make the divine religion a cause of rancor and hatred. They should meet all with the utmost kindliness, forbearance and love, and present the Word. If it is accepted and the radiance of the All-Merciful is observed in their countenance, let them be thankful to God the Exalted. Otherwise, they should leave such a one to himself, without allowing him to perceive any lack of love. Pure, assured, content and well-pleasing souls are loved and cherished by every person for their praiseworthy attributes and spiritual qualities. However, heedless souls must be loved for the sake of God, that perchance they may not regard the Source of mercy and grace as a cause of opposition, and that the earth may find some measure of peace. We testify that there is no God but Him, acknowledging that which the Supreme Pen hath spoken in the beginning of days. And we testify that thou hast turned, hast seen and heard and triumphed, and hast arisen to serve the people of the world, by the command of God, the Lord of ancient days. Blessed art thou, and thy family, and those who are with thee. And we send greetings and glorification upon the loved ones of God in thy region and in all lands, and We give them glad tidings of God’s remembrance and mercy, and We counsel them to be steadfast, trustworthy, truthful and faithful, and to observe that which God hath revealed in the Book.”</p>
<p>As to the mention that was made of Aqa Ghulam-’Ali of K., upon him be the glory of God, and his praiseworthy character - this is indeed as that beloved one hath written, for repeated mention of him was heard from the Kingdom of utterance. God willing, may he be confirmed and, through the elixir of sincerity, transmute the copper of existence into pure gold, and clothe earthly temples with new garments through the rain-showers of knowledge of the Lord of Days. This is not difficult for God.</p>
<p>And as to what you wrote mentioning the feast and the migration of some for the sake of God, this was presented before His presence. He said: “Praise be to God that through the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, souls have appeared in the land of Kha who are worthy of divine mention and the refinement of souls. The honored teacher has ever been and continues to be remembered before the Wronged One. A detailed Tablet was specifically revealed for him, but its dispatch has been delayed until now. Should God will it, He will send it. Verily He is the Helper, the All-Wise. And peace be upon him on the day he heard and acknowledged, and the day he spoke among the servants, and the day he returns to God, the Lord of the worlds.”</p>
<p>As regards what you wrote concerning the ascension of the Leaf, upon her be the Glory of God and His mercy and grace, together with her testamentary dispositions - these were presented before His presence, and He said: “O thou who art enkindled with the fire of My love! Upon thee be My Glory. Hearken unto My call. Verily He hath mentioned thee in this night time and again, and this is yet another time, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds. And concerning what thou hast mentioned about the Leaf who hath returned to the Divine Lote-Tree, with her Lord, the Most Glorious - We testify that she heard and attained, acknowledged and drank the choice wine of reunion, and ascended unto the Self-Sufficing, the Most High. Thus doth My Pen and My Tongue bear witness unto her in this mighty station. I testify that she believed in her Lord when most of the servants denied Him, and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon when mankind turned away. Blessed is she and blessed is he who remembereth her with what the Tongue of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath remembered her. O My Leaf! The Wronged One loveth to make mention of thy father who, when he heard the glad-tidings of attaining Our presence, cast the world behind him, turning with his face - which God had honored from turning to aught else - toward the Most Great Prison. We have mentioned him in numerous Tablets and in the Crimson Book which none hath discovered save the One, the All-Informed. Through his arising to serve the Cause, steadfastness was manifested in the lands, and through his turning toward the prison precincts, the hearts of those who have attained were turned. The radiant light shining from the horizon of the brow be upon him and upon thee and upon those who have testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth - that there is none other God but Him, the Compassionate, the Generous.”</p>
<p>His approval was bestowed upon her testamentary dispositions, and they were honored with His signature. He commanded that they be carried out exactly as she had wished. Her testament bears witness to her station with God. Whatever needs to be done in that land, do it, and whatever is rightful will assuredly be done.</p>
<p>This evanescent servant beseeches God, exalted be His glory, to assist all the handmaidens to remember what they have seen and heard from that Leaf, and to strive to attain unto that which God loveth and is pleased with - this is the source and beginning of all good. According to His command, it would be most fitting and appropriate to deal amicably with her spouse. Should he, of his own accord, choose to carry out the testament, this would be well-pleasing in the sight of God. Verily, He commandeth His servants with that which profiteth them in every world of His worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the settlement of the survivors in the land of Kha and Ta, this was presented, and this is what was revealed in reply: “O thou who standest firm in My service and gazest upon My face!” You yourself should sometimes be settled and sometimes traveling - this is what the All-Choosing One hath chosen for you. As for the survivors who have dwelt for years in the land of Kha, it is best that they remain settled there as before. Should wisdom at any time require movement, there is no objection. These lands are now in turmoil and commotion, and the surroundings are greatly disturbed. We beseech God to protect them from the evil of cannons and rifles, and from those whom the world hath deluded with a delusion beyond the power of pens to describe.</p>
<p>Concerning the dispatch of petitions from the friends about which you wrote, according to His command if they present their petitions with utmost brevity their dispatch is permissible, for they will both attain the blessing and bring joy to your honor. In all matters, according to His command, wisdom must be observed and all friends must hold fast unto it. The matter of teaching, which is among the most momentous of all matters, has in God’s Book been made contingent upon wisdom. He says: “With wisdom and utterance.” First wisdom, then utterance. Exalted is He Who hath desired for us in all matters what is good from His presence and taught us that whereby the Cause is uplifted without raising the clamor of every heedless doubter. Once these supreme blessed words were heard from the Tongue of Grandeur. He said: “Man can refresh the dispirited with the waters of grace and quicken the dead with the living waters without uttering what would be objectionable in the estimation of men.” And He said: “Blessed is he who giveth the people to drink from the sea of the utterance of the All-Merciful without speaking a word that would cause rejection and objection.” Indeed, forbearance is most beloved. Any soul who shows the slightest acceptance will later comprehend most matters himself, but if at first a word is expressed that is beyond his capacity, he will not bear it and will arise in opposition.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about whether, if one of the friends wishes to send a letter to those parts other than the Divine Tablets and other than those of the Branches of God - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - and this servant, it should be reviewed and then dispatched: indeed this point is most beloved, for at present in this land there are about two hundred of the divine friends, and just as they differ in character and conduct, they certainly differ likewise in expression. However, this is a matter that cannot be mentioned to all, for some may become distressed. Therefore the divine friends in whatever land they may be, if they receive a letter or missive, they should examine it. If it conflicts with divine ordinances and heavenly utterances according to outward appearance, they should not accept it and should inquire of the source. If it attains the honor of approval it is acceptable, otherwise rejected. The purpose is that no difference should occur in any matter.</p>
<p>Concerning M.S., upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s glory] - 669, as they had written, in response to that loved one’s request, from the heaven of divine favor a Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Wondrous Tablet was revealed specifically for them and sent. And since they had asked to be assisted in a matter that would become the cause of everlasting, eternal remembrance, they were commanded to appoint a representative for the construction of an exalted, lofty House. This is a matter that will endure and persist throughout the continuance of the Most Beautiful Names, and its fruits are greater, more glorious and more excellent than a hundred thousand children. However, after their second letter stating that they themselves wished to pay the Huququ’llah, after this matter was presented, He said that if the Huquq is paid and this edifice is raised therefrom, it would be nearer and more excellent in the sight of God and would be adorned with the ornament of acceptance. In this case, absolute freedom is attained. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth, and He is the Commander, the Doer, the All-Choosing. In truth this is a great bounty towards them. They should occupy themselves day and night with praise and thanksgiving to God, and should act upon what has been commanded with the utmost joy and fragrance, submission and contentment. Blessed be he!</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote about the honored mother and daughter of Ismu’llah, upon them be Baha’u’llah’s glory, it was presented before His presence. This is what was revealed for them from the Kingdom of the favor of our Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed</p>
<p>O My leaves and she who is related to My Name! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, against Whom the divines of the earth pronounced judgment even as they pronounced judgment in former times against My Name, Who strove in My path until He was martyred in the land of ?aff, yearning to attain My presence, the Mighty, the Wondrous. We console thee and My handmaidens concerning that which hath befallen you in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have mentioned her with a mention to which nothing on earth can compare. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We made mention of thee before as a token of Our grace, and at this time in My Most Great Prison. Grieve not over anything that shall pass away. Soon shall perish that wherewith the people are occupied, and there shall endure that which hath been revealed for thee by His Mighty, Firm Pen. O My leaf and daughter of My Name, Who hath circumambulated My Throne with manifest light! We shall be with you in all conditions, and We see those who dwell in the house and hear what they utter, and I am the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. The glory and the peace be upon your men and your women, and upon the first among you who, through his acceptance, caused the Concourse on High to bear witness on a day wherein the divines trembled with fear of the Command. Thus hath My Most Exalted Pen testified in this sublime station.</p>
<p>For the people of H and M, wondrous and exalted Tablets were also revealed and sent. God willing, they have by now arrived. And the Tablets that were requested for Sh.H. will be sent by His exalted grace. This evanescent servant conveys greetings and salutations to all those whose names were mentioned and those that remained unmentioned, and hopes that all will act as befitteth the days of God and will hold fast in all conditions to that which hath been revealed in the Book, so that from the trees of existence wondrous and exalted traces and delicate, ripe fruits may appear in the assemblage of the world with such freshness and grace as will attract all, whether by choice or without choice.</p>
<p>When mention was made of Mirza Habibullah, Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, Shaykh Muhammad and ’Azizu’llah, upon them be the Glory of God, they attained the honor of being heard in His presence. Although in these days, in accordance with wisdom, silence in these lands is preferable to speech and stillness is more beloved than motion, nevertheless the tongue of bounty speaks these sublime words, His exalted Word:</p>
<p>O Habib! God willing, mayest thou be the recipient of divine favors. Before and after thou art mentioned in the presence of His countenance. This has been and is one of God’s greatest bounties. Strive at all times and under all conditions to gaze toward the Most Exalted Horizon and to speak in praise of God, exalted be His glory. Should all the powers of the world attempt to assess the value of but a moment of these days, they would find themselves utterly powerless. By God’s life! It has been and continues to be lofty in worth and sublime in station.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Haydar before ’Ali and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy, My favor, and My grace, and I am the Compassionate, the Generous. We have made mention of him in a manner that nothing can equal it, and I am the True, the Faithful Informer.</p>
<p>And We make mention of him who is named Muhammad, who was mentioned before God, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy fragrances which were wafted in the Hijaz and by the lights of Thy countenance which illumined Batha, to protect Thy religion from the wicked ones who have encompassed Thy cities and Thy lands, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. Then grant me the wine of steadfastness in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O ’Aziz! Upon thee be My Glory! Some time ago a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet was revealed and sent especially for thee. Praise be to God that thou hast attained the wine of bounty, drunk from the Kawthar of acceptance, been sustained by the Tasnim of grace, and reached the everlasting feast. Strive that these lofty, transcendent stations may remain preserved. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon My loved ones in those regions whom God hath purified from the defilement of idle fancies, drawn nigh unto Himself and caused them to know His straight Path. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>The second letter from that beloved one, dated the 22nd of Rajab, was as a balm for the lamp of the heart, or as a light joined to another light. In brief, it illumined all limbs with the light of joy. Prior to these two letters, when outwardly no news had arrived from that beloved one, this matter became a cause of sorrow. At times this evanescent servant would chant the words “O lost one, where shall I seek thee?” in his inmost heart. However, that which was heard from the tongue of utterance of the All-Merciful was the cause of tranquility and assurance. Praise be to God that afterwards glad-tidings upon glad-tidings arrived, namely two letters were received. In any case, this poor and helpless one implores the Ancient Almighty that He may assist that beloved one with His special confirmations and protect him with the hosts of the seen and unseen from the harm of enemies. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Protector, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>After reading and becoming informed, I proceeded to the Most Exalted Goal and presented it before His countenance. He said: “O servant in attendance! Praise be to God, the son of My Name, upon him be My glory, has been confirmed and will attain to that which hath been revealed specially for him from the Supreme Pen.” And He said that in the days when they were standing at the Gate, listening, and present before the Face, gazing, and had attained the waters of reunion, they requested a brief visitation tablet for the Crimson Leaf from the heaven of the bounty of the Lord of existence, and We promised this most great favor. Therefore at this time there descends from the heaven of Will that of which every letter testifies to the grace, kindness and mercy of God, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>“O Crimson Leaf and Most Glorious Sign! I bear witness that through thee the fire of love and affection was kindled in the hearts of the servants. Thou art she who chanted in the nights and days the praise of God, the Lord of all beings. Thou art she who heard the Call in the beginning of days, and the attraction of the utterance of the All-Merciful seized thee in such wise that thy heart was melted and thy very being was set ablaze. Through thee appeared the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and the cry of the Kingdom was raised amongst creation. I testify that thou didst rend asunder the veils through the name of thy Lord, the Lord of the Final End, and hastened with thy heart to the Most Exalted Horizon, and turned toward the Face in such wise that neither the doubts of the learned, nor the imaginings of the mystics, nor the power of rulers prevented thee. I bear witness that thou didst lament in separation as one bereaved, and didst forsake all that was in the world, holding fast to the Most Firm Handle. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness be upon thee, and upon thy beginning and thine end, and upon those who loved thee and remembered thy days and what befell thee in the path of thy Lord. Blessed is the handmaiden who drew nigh unto thee and found solace with thee in thy days, and woe unto him who wronged thee and uttered concerning thee that which caused the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise to wail at eventide and at dawn. Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by this celestial note and this heavenly cry and this sign of oneness that Thou forgive whosoever turned toward her purely for Thy sake, and absolve his greatest transgressions and mightiest sins. Then forgive his father and mother and all who sought her and visited her shrine. Verily Thou art the Powerful One Whom nothing can frustrate and no affair can hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleasest. Verily Thou art the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>O Son of My Name! Whosoever desires to visit the honored sister and the Crimson Leaf and the family of God from among the household, whose adornment is the good-pleasure of God, may visit with that which hath been revealed by the Most Holy Pen from God, the Lord of all creation. This is yet another gift from Us unto thee. Be thou grateful and numbered with them that render thanks.</p>
<p>This blessed passage was suddenly revealed from the heaven of God’s Will when the second letter of that one was presented. They said to the Son of My Name, upon him be My glory: We promised that a brief visitation prayer would be revealed and sent for the Crimson Leaf, as that which was previously revealed from the Supreme Pen is somewhat difficult for the generality of people to read. Now We have willed to fulfill Our promise and bestow that which was requested. Verily, He is the Near, the Answering One.</p>
<p>This is a bounty from Him unto you. It is hoped that His grace, mercy and favor may repeatedly overtake that beloved one in full manifestation. Verily, He is the Protector of whosoever turns unto Him, and the Companion of whosoever calls upon Him, in his journey and his resting-place.</p>
<p>And concerning what was mentioned in another letter about the enkindlement, unity and steadfastness of the people of that land - this is indeed the greatest cause for the dawning of the light of joy and gladness. In truth, this matter is the foundation of the world. The repose, tranquility, blessing and prosperity of the world depend upon this matter. Blessed and exalted be His Word: “Through the light of unity hath the world been illumined, and through the warmth of accord have the horizons been set ablaze.”</p>
<p>God willing, may the temples of the people of Baha never be deprived in any state of this adorning, which is counted as the first adorning.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about permission being granted from the land of Ta through the honored Thamarih, upon her be the glory of God, for the mother of your honored wife, upon them both be the glory of God, to proceed to the Most Holy Court - this servant has no information about this matter and has not heard of it. Although the True One, exalted be His glory, has ever cast the gaze of His loving-kindness upon His Most Truthful Name and you and those related to him, as the divine Tablets testify and bear witness to this fact, yet these regions are all in turmoil and upheaval. Naval vessels and great cannons surround the area. Alexandria was laid waste in ten hours, and the helpless people were scattered to all regions. The owls of the world’s ruins oppress the white falcons, and the demons of the age lie in wait to ambush the angels of the realm of inner meanings. May God protect us and you from the evil of the oppressors.</p>
<p>A group of the loved ones of God who were occupied in that land left behind whatever possessions they had, and, detached from perishable ornaments, turned toward the Court of Unity, and now they wander about. In such circumstances it is evident that movement is not permitted. Each day news arrives that one group rises against another. From some directions news has arrived that certain souls who had permission in previous years have intended to come this year, apparently unaware of the conditions in these parts and what has transpired. In any case, this evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, not to withhold the gaze of His loving-kindness from the people of the world. For years the earth has been observed in turmoil. Each day a new calamity appears and at every moment an uproar is raised. Yet the people have not become aware and will not become aware except through the compelling, all-encompassing, penetrating and effective Command from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of Aqa Mirza Haydar-’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, and the people of the Green City - mention of them has been and continues to be made, praise be to God, in the Most Holy Court. Regarding the Tablets they had requested for Mazindaran, some have been revealed, but sending them in these days has become very difficult, as most affairs in this land and its surroundings are in turmoil due to Europe’s uprising against Islam. The poor and helpless - it is time for prayer. Prayer is from us, acceptance from God. Verily, He has power over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>Similarly, a letter arrived from Aqa ’Abdu’l-Husayn from the Green City, mentioning Aqa Muhammad-Kazim and his relatives and other friends, upon them be the Glory of God. For each one was revealed that which the world and all within it cannot equal, and it was sent. God willing, they will attain unto it.</p>
<p>Likewise, these past two days a letter also arrived from Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God, which also contained names of souls who had turned towards God. However, since wondrous and exalted verses had been revealed from the heaven of bounty for most of them a few days prior, they again stated it was not necessary. As commanded, that beloved one should write the details to Aqa Muhammad-Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God, and he should give the glad tidings of the all-encompassing bounty, pre-existing mercy, and wondrous and exalted grace to the friends of that land, so that upon all their foreheads may be inscribed from the seal of utterance “The Kingdom is God’s”, and from their faces may appear the radiance of glory.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, they are engaged in service to the Cause and in mention of God, exalted be His glory. God has favored some above others and aided all to turn to Him. Verily, He is the Single One, the All-Informed. Soon will appear in the world the signs and fruits of the trees planted by the hands of power. The divine promises will certainly be fulfilled in the world of dominion. The glory from God, the Compassionate, the Generous, be upon them.</p>
<p>Concerning what they wrote about intending to travel to certain places - God willing, it is blessed, and surely God, exalted be His glory, will make its fruits manifest. Verily, He will aid you through His grace. He is the All-Bountiful, the Helper, the Generous.</p>
<p>Regarding the mention of visitation at the end of the letter - on Thursday, the third of the month of Shawwal, which is the last day of the blessed feast of Rama?an, after the verses were written, that which is the purpose of all worlds was performed in your presence by proxy. Now all created things should say “Well done and congratulations!” We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to ever aid this servant and that beloved one in that which is pleasing to Him and befitting of His days. Blessed art thou, and blessed are they who have held fast to the Book of God and acted according to what they were commanded by the All-Knowing Ordainer.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of the Supreme Pen be upon you and upon those who have renounced the world, turning to God, the Lord of eternity, He at Whose appearance all things proclaimed “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Mighty, the Wise.” Praise be to God, the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>3rd of the honored month of Shawwal 1299</p>
<p>The reply for the husband of the Leaf, the Sister, upon her be the Glory of God, and the physician will be sent later.</p>
<p>=== END BH00124 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00125 ===</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, His is the grandeur and majesty!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who opened the gate of revelation with the key of His Most Mighty, Most Holy, Most Glorious Name and summoned all through His sweetest call to the supreme horizon! Thereupon the sincere were attracted, the unitarians drew near, the near ones took flight, the seekers sought, and those who turned did turn. The wine of the utterance of the All-Merciful so intoxicated all contingent beings that every extinguished one was set aflame, every frozen one was melted, every sleeper was awakened, every fallen one arose, and every seated one hastened forth, as though every atom among the atoms of creation turned towards the Dawning-Place of verses and the Day-Spring of clear signs. Then did the Lord of Names desire to test His servants and commanded His Most Exalted Pen to speak that which would raise the standards of tribulation amidst the concourse of creation. When it spoke and the standards were raised, conditions were transformed, foundations were shaken, bodies trembled, hearts were struck with fear, souls quaked, feet stumbled, and mankind was divided: Among them were those who turned to these standards, embraced them, kissed them, and hastened to the place of sacrifice in the path of God, Creator of heaven; and among them were those whose faces reddened with the fire of God’s love and who sacrificed themselves and their possessions in His path in such wise as to astonish the Concourse on High; and among them were those who hastened forth and those who hesitated and those who turned away and those who retreated and those who regretted their acceptance and those who were seized with such perturbation as to oppose the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Thus was the matter decreed from before God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>O my beloved Abu’l-Hasan! This blessed word was repeatedly heard from the Most Holy and Exalted Tongue, saying: “Verily, this Cause is mighty, mighty indeed!” By the Sun of the horizon of certitude, the greatness of God’s Cause and the stations of steadfast souls cannot be reckoned by the pen nor encompassed by the tongue. The greatness of this Day and this Cause was revealed and recorded aforetime in the divine Books. Most people today are heedless, occupied with these perishable things whose transience they witness with both their outer and inner eyes, while remaining oblivious and bewildered regarding the immortal Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the Book of Joel it is recorded: “For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; who can abide it?” And likewise it states: “The Lord shall roar from Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake.” Jerusalem is Akka, the Holy Land and its environs, and Zion is a place in these lands, as well as a place in Jerusalem. From this valley the divine Call has been raised, and the throne of divine Justice has been established in this land. Blessed are they whom the diverse colors of the world have not caused to deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p>Would that one of these souls who today consider themselves learned and who have arisen to oppose the Truth would come to their senses and become awakened by the Word of God, and would reflect: For what reason was Noah’s lamentation? Why did his people reject him? What was the meaning of Hud’s abasement? Why was Salih’s she-camel hamstrung and he himself banished? Why did Jesus, son of Mary, ascend to the fourth heaven, and at whose hands did He suffer tribulations? Why did the Sun of Batha [Muhammad] turn towards Yathrib? For what purpose did Ja’far-i-Tayyar and his companions go to the Negus? The wine of vain desire hath so seized these heedless ones that they have not been able to reflect for a moment. They ride the steed of self and gallop in the arena of ignorance. Soon shall they lament and cry out “Would that we were but dust!”</p>
<p>Man is astonished at what these people cling to and to whom they adhere. If they deny this Manifestation, its revealed verses, its demonstrations of power, and its resplendent and manifest evidences, to what cause are they turning and to which religion do they adhere? Fie upon them and those who follow them! Observe how in all the Books the mention of the Day of Manifestation is clearly recorded; nevertheless, they have done what no people have ever done. In the Revelation of John it is recorded: “And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband… And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it.” And Jerusalem is now become the place of the Divine Throne.</p>
<p>It seems as though the sense of taste hath been lost in the world and the faculty of understanding vanished, for most of the servants have not found the sweetness of the utterance of the All-Merciful and have failed to comprehend that which hath appeared from the Kingdom of power. They are engaged in cawing while veiled from the Luminary of the horizons. We beseech God that those souls who have drunk from the water of life and attained unto the sealed wine may hold fast unto the Book of God and His verses, that is, may observe […]</p>
<p>Let them hold fast unto His verses - that is, let them contemplate and reflect, and quicken the dead of the earth through the breaths of wisdom and utterance. Know ye with certitude that those souls who are this day adorned with the ornament of love and are mentioned by the name of God, exalted be His glory, if they arise to serve the Cause - that is, if they engage in teaching the divine Cause with the utmost wisdom, speaking for God’s sake and making mention of Him for His sake - they will assuredly transform the world of brass into a world of gold. Blessed are they who have recognized this day and acted according to its requirements. The evanescence of the world is clear and evident, and the Tree of Revelation hath appeared at the supreme station of Sinai, speaking forth; yet none are aware save whom God willeth, our Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of all worlds. We beseech God to assist His servants to recognize what is intended and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Mighty over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Helper, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Thereafter, thy letter dated the 15th of Shavval was received. Praise be to God, it became a source of joy and gladness, for it was adorned with the remembrance of God and embellished with His praise. God willing, mayest thou ever drink from the Kawthar of divine mercy and be assisted in His service. The loving-kindness of the Beloved hath encompassed thee and will continue to do so. Concerning what thou didst mention about the Afnan, Aqa Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be all Glory of Glories, having summoned thee - this was presented at the Holy Threshold. This is what the All-Merciful hath revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance:</p>
<p>“O Abu’l-Hasan! We have heard thy call and what thou didst write to the servant who standeth before the Throne. We answered thee before, and in this noble station We say: Rejoice in My remembrance and give thanks unto God for having assisted thee and made thee among the successful ones. Thou hast attained the presence of thy Lord and heard His mighty and wondrous call. The deeds of no doer in the path of God have been or ever shall be lost. All matters are clear and evident before God. Verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Be thou assured of thy Lord’s favor and hold fast unto the cord of steadfastness in this mighty Cause. Act according to what the Afnan of the Sacred Tree hath written. When thou seest My Afnan, convey to him My glorification, and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance, My loving-kindness and My manifest grace. The Sacred Tree gazeth upon its Afnans. He hath created them, provided for them, exalted them, caused them to know Him, and hath written down for them from His Most Exalted Pen that which none knoweth save His Self, the One Who dominateth the worlds.”</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about Jinab-i-‘Ayn-Ba’, upon him be the Glory of God - he hath ever been mentioned at the Most Great Scene and hath been and will continue to be the recipient of divine bounties. The purport of this matter hath been revealed in one of the Tablets: “Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” We beseech God to assist all and enable them to make mention of Him and praise Him. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Jalil, it was presented. These are His mighty words: “Today the gate of grace is open. How excellent is the state of one who hath rent asunder the veils and attained to the recognition of the Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation. The true seekers have not been and shall never be deprived of their Goal. God willing, may they be gladdened through His grace and remain fixed upon His horizon. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Haji Aqa Baba, it was presented before the Most Sublime Vision. He said: “O Abu’l-Hasan! We have heard what thou didst mention regarding him. We beseech God to enable him and all who are on earth to drink from this Ocean which surgeth before their faces. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. We make mention of him whom thou didst mention. Give him the glad-tidings of this remembrance from thy Lord, the All-Wise. Blessed is the soul that hath awakened in the days of its Lord, and the face that hath reddened from His love, and the hand that hath attained unto the taking of His Book. Thus hath the Pen spoken from this exalted station. By the life of God! What hath been created on earth cannot be compared with My remembrance, yet most of the people are heedless. We make mention of H and S who hath believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to give him and those who have believed to drink that which will purify them from all else save Him and draw them nigh unto Him. He is the Single One, the All-Informed. We perceive the fragrance of My love from there. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones who have attained unto My recognition and clung to the hem of My bounty. They are assuredly among the most exalted of creation before the Truth, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Malik-Husayn, He showed favor, saying that God willing, his pilgrimage is accepted before the Throne. Whosoever turneth to God with sincere intention shall never be disappointed or deprived. The prohibition that was revealed was due to God’s all-encompassing wisdom, as hath been revealed in certain Tablets. Blessed be they who attain! I beseech God, exalted and glorified be He, to assist him and make him steadfast in His love.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about marriage, permission hath been granted. God willing, it is blessed, but is contingent upon the consent of both parties, as revealed in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the beloved R and J, upon whom be all the most glorious Glory of God, praise be to God, they have attained unto God’s special favors. Indeed, it is exactly as you have written, nay even greater. Some time ago, this servant wrote briefly to them and by command sent the Tablet of Proof that they might recite it and share it with upright and receptive souls, that perchance the peoples of the world might attain unto new life through the breaths of the verses of the All-Merciful. If you meet them, convey my greetings. God willing, may they drink and give to drink from the choice wine of the Recognition of the All-Merciful at all times. We beseech God to assist the souls in that land to hearken unto that which they mention concerning the Cause of God.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Haji Mulla Kazim, it was submitted, and this is what the All-Giving revealed in response: “O Abu’l-Hasan! The horizons have been filled with the signs of thy Lord, the Master of the Day of Meeting. We sent him a Tablet before and revealed therein that which brought delight to the eyes of the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him in serving His Cause - verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth - and to give him to drink that which will draw him unto Him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. He who hath attained unto His forgiveness and drunk the Kawthar of His knowledge is assuredly among those who are brought near, as recorded in the Books and Tablets.” God willing, may the people of that land attain unto the hearing of the Tablet of Proof and the previously revealed Tablets. By the life of God! If today any soul should read one of the divine Tablets with a sanctified tongue and pure heart, and turn towards it, he will surely attain unto the Kawthar of steadfastness and will speak in praise of the Desired One. Blessed are they who act! Blessed are they who hear! Joy be to them who attain!</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Ahmad (upon him be the Glory of God) from M., it was submitted, and this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hath turned his face toward My countenance and dwelt beneath the tabernacles of My mercy, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. O Ahmad! We behold the servants playing like children on the shores of the sea of heedlessness and forgetfulness. By My life! They gather only pebbles. Thus doth the Revealer of verses inform thee from this station which God hath made the most exalted of stations. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and in that which We have formerly revealed unto thee. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and the servant who was present read it, and We have mentioned thee with a mention that hath caused the pens to be attracted. Convey My greetings to the faces of those who have believed in God in thy land and give them glad tidings of the favor of their Lord, Who dissolveth illusions. Say: Be not grieved at anything, put your trust in God, then remember Him in the nights and days. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken by the command of God, the Lord of all mankind. The Glory be upon thee and upon thy sons and upon those who have attained unto the mention of their Lord, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>Regarding what you mentioned about the sons of the beloved Mahbubi (upon him be nine [Glory] most glorious), it was presented before the Throne. He showed His favor, and God willing, may they all attain unto that which befitteth them. I beseech the Truth to adorn them with such an ornament as shall cause the slumbering ones of the earth to awaken.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Muhammad Big, expressions of loving-kindness have been shown to him from the Dawning-Place of the Cause, both before and after. He should offer thanks to God with a hundred thousand tongues at all times, for He has enabled him to serve some of His loved ones, and exalted Tablets were specifically revealed and sent to him in previous years, with which he was favored. If you meet him, convey on behalf of this evanescent one a wondrous and glorious greeting - but such a greeting that would cause hearts and minds to soar in the atmosphere of the love of our Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. And mention was made of Muhammad Husayn, Turab Big, Aqa Ghulam Husayn and Sha?ir in the presence of His glory. He said: “Verily We make mention of those who have remembered Us and turned to Our Most Exalted Horizon and have attained unto Our choicest Wine, whose seal We have broken through Our Most Exalted, Most Glorious Name. Thus hath the Truth spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance that His servants may rejoice thereby. He is, verily, the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Say: Verily He heareth every call and seeth every deed and beholdeth every aspiration. He is, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>All the loved ones of God are mentioned at the Throne. How could it be that one should make mention of God, or succeed in performing a good deed, and yet be deprived of the grace of God? The names of those souls who have turned to Him and remained steadfast are recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. All the friends must strive to attain to this station. Verily He seeth and knoweth; He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the sons of Aqa Siyyid Husayn, who hath ascended unto God, it was presented before His Most Holy Presence. This is what the Beloved hath revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance: “O Abu’l-Hasan! We made mention of Husayn before, and We mention him in this station that his rank may be made manifest. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He hath ascended unto the All-Merciful with joy and delight and dwelleth in the proximity of his Lord’s loving-kindness, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Make mention on My behalf of his son and his daughter, then his daughter who hath believed in God, the Lord of all worlds, then his wife who hath migrated in the path of God. We counsel them to be patient and to show forth fortitude in what hath befallen them in the days of their Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Say: Be not grieved at anything. That wherein princes rejoice and every heedless doubter prideth himself shall soon pass away. They see themselves in a station while you are in the most exalted station. He Who speaketh in the world among the peoples beareth witness to this. There is none other God but Me, the One, the All-Informed.”</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about Mirza [?] Kh-A, it was presented. He said: “God willing, may he drink at all times from the Kawthar of utterance through the grace of the All-Merciful and keep his gaze fixed upon the Most Exalted Horizon. The days have no constancy. The changes and transformations of the world are like a tongue giving news to its people of the passing away and extinction of all that exists therein. Therefore, those possessed of vision, whose eyes are illumined with the light of divine knowledge, turn to that which endureth and is befitting. Blessed is he who knoweth the value of these days and ariseth to do what is meet and seemly. He is indeed among those possessed of vision in the Most Great Scene and among those endued with understanding in the concourse of creation. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid him and enable him to do what He loveth and is pleased with. Make mention on My behalf of ’Ali-Qabli-Muhammad whom thou didst mention in the letter thou didst send to the servant who is present before the Wronged One, that My remembrance may draw him to the Kingdom of Utterance and strengthen him in this Cause wherein the feet of those who followed vain imaginings have slipped.”</p>
<p>As thou didst mention Haji Muhammad-’Ali and his son Aqa ’Abdu’l-Husayn, as well as Aqa Mirza Muhammad-Husayn who had conveyed their greetings to this servant, mention was made of them all in the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of loving-kindness hath shone upon each one. God willing, may they ever be engaged in the praise and glorification of the Revealer of verses, and strive with wisdom and utterance to quicken souls. Thus far was the reply to thy previous letter dated […] 152. As for thy second letter dated the 25th of Mu?arram 1297, it was received and thy love for the Beloved of the world was evident and manifest. Blessed art thou for God hath enabled thee to recognize Him, to utter His praise, and to turn unto Him. This evanescent servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to aid thee to remain steadfast in His Cause and to manifest through thee that which would cause His remembrance.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about thy business affairs - grieve not for what hath passed, nor rejoice in what is to come. These are words uttered by the Revealer of verses. God hath ever been and will ever be the All-Possessing. In this land there are nearly one hundred and fifty souls, and there are five cities. The subsistence allowance from the government hath not been received, and four places have been specifically designated for travelers in these days. Though prices and costs have reached their highest point, yet by God’s grace and bounty all are comfortable and at ease. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and He is indeed the All-Bountiful, the Munificent. Place thy trust in all circumstances in the Self-Subsisting. Verily He giveth and withholdeth, and He is indeed the Bestower, the Withholder, the Bountiful, the Generous. Yet praise be to God that thy past and future services to the Cause have been and shall be accepted. The servant doth praise God for having perceived from thee the fragrance of truthfulness and trustworthiness. This is the most excellent of all stations, even as in this past year the Tablet of Trustworthiness, the Tablet of Truthfulness, the Tablet of Faithfulness, the Tablet of Detachment, and the Tablet of the Balance were revealed from the heaven of divine Will. Blessed is he who hath read them and acted upon what hath been commanded by the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As for thy expression of embarrassment before ’A.B., may the glory of God rest upon him, from the beginning of the Cause until now he hath served to the extent of his capacity and shown love to the friends of God. We beseech God to strengthen him, and God willing, he hath been and will continue to be assisted. Mention was made of him in the Most Holy Court. And concerning what thou didst write about ’A.B. Naw, may the glory of God rest upon him, his love and sincerity are evident before the Divine Throne. Convey my greetings unto him, and a Tablet specifically for him was sent with Varqa, may the glory of God rest upon him. God willing, may he attain unto it. I beseech God to assist him, to strengthen him, and to ordain for him that which beseemeth His generosity. Verily He is the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>During the writing of this letter, this evanescent servant was summoned into His presence, whereupon the Ancient Tongue spoke these blessed words: “O Abu’l-Hasan! Blessed art thou for having fulfilled My covenant and My testament, for having held fast to the cord of My love, and for having attained unto My presence, wherewith the Books of God, both past and future, have been adorned. Be thou thankful and say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world’s desire!’ Let all thy deeds be for God, thy Lord. Act thou for God, speak thou for God, and move thou for God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible, the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>In all matters, it is essential to regard the servants of God with an eye to His previous grace and mercy. Therefore, one must be mindful in all deeds, lest any action cause grief to anyone, especially the friends of God, upon whom the eye of His loving-kindness is fixed and toward whom the drops of the ocean of His generosity are directed. Whatsoever is thought to prevent the general welfare of people is not and never shall be permissible.</p>
<p>“O Abu’l-Hasan! Follow thy Lord. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Kind, the Loving, the Generous, the All-Bountiful, the All-Merciful, the Compassionate.”</p>
<p>The hoarding of certain commodities that constitute the sustenance of the general populace is not and has never been permissible. Though thy actions were performed for the sake of God, as thou hadst no such intention, yet in view of God’s decisive command revealed in His infinite verses, the withholding of certain grains is not permissible. Therefore, thou must ever be mindful of God’s commandments and prohibitions.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! People are heedless of God’s mercy and loving-kindness, and have imagined that the appearance of the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dawning-Place of His Revelation would cause harm to His servants. Thus have they denied the divine bounty and closed the doors of His outpourings upon their own faces. Thus doth inform thee He Who possesseth the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.</p>
<p>In brief, the withholding of sustenance from animals is not permissible, let alone from human beings. Glory be unto him who followeth the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>O My beloved! Observe the divine grace and mercy, that He hath never been pleased with harm to any of His servants. Although thy deed was clearly and manifestly done for God’s sake, yet observe how the rain of grace and bounty hath poured down from the heaven of mercy and the clouds of generosity. In one instance, the Supreme Pen hath revealed these exalted words: “The true Sun is the Word of God. This is the Sun by which the education of the world dependeth, and by whose lights the hearts of the sincere ones and those who are near unto God are illumined. It behooveth thee and Me and all peoples of the world to say: ‘Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art a mercy unto all worlds!’”</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about Aqa ’Abdu’s-Samad and his deeds, mention of him hath been made before, and holy and sublime verses concerning him have been revealed from the Supreme Pen and sent forth. Well is it with him in that he hath been mentioned by the Pen of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the honored ?abib, his eminence Varqa, upon him be the Glory of God - this brought joy and gladness. God willing, may he ever be assisted and arise to serve the Cause. In truth, when returning from this land, he was aflame with the fire of divine love. We beseech the Most High to grant him success in all conditions and aid him in His service. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. A few days ago a brief letter was sent to him along with wondrous and sublime Tablets which he had requested for some of the friends.</p>
<p>Whenever you meet Sha?ir Rida, upon him be the Glory of God, convey greetings on behalf of this servant and mention him. I assure you with certainty that God, exalted be His glory, has not forgotten and will never forget His loved ones. It behooveth every soul to thank Him at all times.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote at the end of your letter, “if He would but once say ‘My servant’…” - praise be to God, these words have been heard repeatedly from the blessed tongue, just as in that same letter they mentioned you in numerous places. How many kings, princes, ministers, divines and mystics departed this transient world longing to hear the divine Word, while you have repeatedly attained this blessing in both absence and presence. What hand or tongue could ever render due thanks for this?</p>
<p>Your services at the Most Holy Court are evident and manifest. No matter has been nor will be obscured. Verily your Lord sees and hears. He is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be assured of His grace.</p>
<p>And concerning what you wrote again in your second letter about His Holiness the Afnan, the honored A. and H.A., upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory - by command: act according to what they have written. Henceforth be not grieved, for you have drunk from the ocean of meeting time and again, and received your portion, and God willing shall receive your portion hereafter, for you have attained permanent permission. By your life, this is a mighty station!</p>
<p>Furthermore, you wrote about the beloved and honored Nabil, upon him be all the Most Glorious Glory. Some time ago a Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablet was specifically revealed and sent to him from the heaven of will. He has always been mentioned at the Most Holy Court. Convey greetings on behalf of this evanescent servant to him and say: O beloved of my heart! While time remains, and life remains, and opportunity remains, and strength remains, and tongue remains, and the age remains - all must strive with utmost wisdom to mention and praise the Truth and teach His Cause. Especially ones like his honor. We beseech God to ever assist him, grant him success, sustain him, and aid him in speech and utterance.</p>
<p>You mentioned the esteemed Mirza Ja’far, brother of the late [Habib]. God willing, may he attain the adorning grace of spiritual recognition and fix his gaze upon the horizon of His Cause. Today, and for all time, that which takes precedence over all else is the love of God. Blessed is he who attains unto that which God hath desired. I beseech His exalted Self to assist him in this, for verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Loving.</p>
<p>Your honor should be exceedingly joyful and manifest boundless delight at all times, for you were engaged in service for several years and attained His presence. The remembrance of your services has not been, nor ever shall be, effaced. Be assured of God’s grace and generosity. Whatsoever hath streamed from the Most Exalted Pen was intended to inform your honor of various matters; otherwise, the Tongue of Grandeur hath testified that you have done nothing for yourself - all that you have done was for the sake of God. This servant yearns for such a station. Although the stations of the loved ones are now veiled, they shall assuredly be made manifest.</p>
<p>Convey my greetings to the honored Amin, upon him be the glory of God, and tell him that I beseech God to keep him steadfast in that which He loveth and approveth. May you ever be adorned with the robe He hath graciously bestowed. Furthermore, write of your circumstances each day. Glory be upon you and upon him and upon whosoever hath voiced the praise of God and hath arisen to serve Him, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have conveyed your expressions of praise, glory, and self-effacement to the Divine Branches - may my spirit and being be offered up for the dust of their most honored footsteps. They remember you with greetings and praise, and likewise do all who circle round the Sacred Precincts send their greetings.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who shineth from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto him who hath attained His presence time and again, and hath drunk the choice wine of recognition from the hands of the bountiful, the gracious favor of his Lord, and who hath circled round the lands to exalt the Word of his Lord, the Chosen One. Blessed is he who hath heard His call, His remembrance and His praise in the mention of this Most Great Remembrance, whereby the heavens have been cleft asunder, the earth hath been split, the mountains have been scattered, and all people have stood before the Lord of the worlds. By God! Through His appearance the world hath been set ablaze, and the Most Exalted Pen hath raised its shrill voice, and the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing hath rustled. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless. Say: This is the Day of God which hath appeared with truth, and the Lote-Tree proclaimeth that there is none other God but I, the Almighty, the Powerful. I created all creation for My manifestation and My days, yet when I manifested Myself they turned away - thus did their souls entice them, and today they are among the most lost in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Hearken unto the call of Him Who hath been wronged. He remembereth thee, and the Most Great Branch writeth before His face. This is of My favor unto thee - be thou grateful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world! The Most Bountiful One hath sent thy letter. He hath testified to that which God testified before the creation of all things. Verily thy Lord is the Witness, the All-Knowing. Thou hast attained unto the hearing of thy Lord, and We have answered thee through this Clear Book, from which every one possessed of perception findeth the fragrance of the utterance of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. We have been with thee and have heard what thou didst mention before all faces. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Say: O thou who leadeth astray! Die in thy wrath! The Hidden One hath appeared and the Promised One hath come with the standards of His verses from God, the Lord of the worlds. By God! That which ye possess of names shall not profit you this Day, nor what hath been mentioned of mirrors. Cast behind you your vain imaginings and turn ye towards the horizon wherefrom the Most Great Luminary hath shone forth. Fear God, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. Cast aside the pond, for lo, the ocean hath manifested its waves; cast aside the brackish water, for by God! the river of life hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful. Turn ye unto it and be not of the patient ones.</p>
<p>Say: O Hadi! Behold the Tree and its fruits, the Sun and its radiance, the Moon and its light, the Sea and its waves, the Heaven and its stars - and be not of them that imagine vainly. Open thine eyes: there hath dawned from the horizon of possibility the Luminary of certitude, as a grace from God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Judge fairly: if thou deniest this Most Great Announcement, by what announcement can that which thou holdest be established? Beware lest thou follow the intimations of them who disbelieved in God when He came with manifest sovereignty. Hearken! Hearken! By God, the Call of God hath been raised. Look! Look! that thou mayest behold that which thy sight was previously veiled from. Thus doth the Wronged One counsel thee and command thee with that which shall free thee from the promptings of the evil ones. God hath testified that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the Kingdom of verses is verily the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Mystery, Whom the Books of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day, had foretold. Consider the people of the Furqan and what they possessed. They would make mention of the Promised One from their pulpits and in their mosques, and lament His separation. Yet when the promise was fulfilled and the horizon of Manifestation was illumined by Him Who conversed on Sinai, they arose in opposition: some denounced Him, some turned away from Him, some objected to Him, and some pronounced judgment against Him with such tyranny as caused the Spirit Faithful to lament. They deemed themselves the most learned and eminent of the divines of the earth, the most accomplished and exalted among them. Yet when the test came, there appeared from them that which caused the eyes of the Concourse on High to shed tears and the hearts of them who are nigh unto God to melt. By God’s life! If thou wouldst look with the eye of fairness, thou wouldst abandon the world and turn toward the Most Great Prison, and stand at its gate, and raise thy hands in supplication, saying: “I have returned unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds, and have repented before Thee, O Thou Desire of the nations. I beseech Thee to forgive my transgressions which prevented me from hearkening unto Thy most sweet call, and my sins which veiled me from beholding the dawning splendors of Thy beauty, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of names. I confess, O Desire of the world, to the words I uttered which caused the sighs of the sincere ones to ascend and the tears of the unitarians to fall. O Lord! I have clung to the cord of Thy bounty and the handle of Thy generosity, and have laid hold on the hem of Thy tender mercies. I beseech Thee to purify me from drawing near to aught except Thee and from making mention of anyone who hath turned away from Thee and disbelieved in Thy signs. O Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the gate of Thy riches, and the thirsty one seeking the ocean of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of the heaven of Thy gifts and the sun of Thy bounty. Thou art verily the Almighty over what Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.”</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Is there any with hearing to hear the scratching of My Pen, and any with sense of smell to detect the fragrance of My wondrous utterance? Is there any with sight to turn toward the Most Sublime Horizon, and any with fairness to judge justly in this Momentous Announcement? Say: If ye deny what hath appeared in the world, then bring forth what ye possess, and be not of them that hesitate. Say: Do ye play with verses at whose revelation the hearts of the highest Paradise were attracted and the hearts of the sincere ones were set ablaze? Say: Soon shall ye see the recompense of your deeds, even as the people of the Furqan saw the recompense of their actions throughout ages and centuries. Whosoever is prevented today from recognizing the Ocean of utterance is verily of the people of the fire in the sight of God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>O Pen! Leave the mention of the misleader and remember My loved ones in Dal and Vav, and give them glad tidings of the bounties of their Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. O people of God! The armies of polytheism have surrounded you with the banners of hypocrisy. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He witnesseth and seeth what hath appeared and what shall appear. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He is the Powerful, the Supreme, the All-Seeing. Your names were presented before the Wronged One. We have remembered you with verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of the world nor by what the nations possess. The Mother Book in the most exalted station beareth witness to this. Blessed are ye, and blessed is he who is among you, and blessed is he who hath clung to the hem of the robe of his Lord, the Possessor of all creation. Say: O people of the Bayan! Where were ye when the Wronged One was standing before the faces of the world, and where were ye when He was under chains and fetters? Be fair! Were it not for Him, who would remind the servants of the days of God, and who would summon them to the supreme horizon? Be fair, and be not of those who disbelieved when the Desired One came with the standards of might and power. I stood before the faces of princes and divines without any veil or covering, and uttered that which caused the limbs of the people to quake. The Books and Tablets which were sent down from the heaven of wisdom and utterance bear witness to this. Read what We sent to the kings and what My tongue hath spoken amongst the parties. Is he who concealed not himself better, or he who had several wives and remained behind the veil morning and evening? Verily, those who have turned away from this Cause are cursed by all things. He Who speaketh and will speak beareth witness that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Bestower. O people of Baha! Blessed are ye and joy be unto you. We beseech God to ordain for you from His Most Exalted Pen that which shall gladden the eyes. Ye have attained unto My remembrance whose fragrance shall never cease to waft for as long as My most excellent names and exalted attributes endure. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this station which hath been named with all names by God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>Hear ye the Voice of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue! Say: O Hadi! Whither hath fairness gone, what hath become of justice? Thou wert of the people of the Furqan. For twelve hundred years and more thou wert occupied with vain imaginings. What hath become of Jabulqa? Whither hath Jabulsa gone? From whom came these falsehoods? Where are these imaginary cities? Consider Ja’far, whom by your own belief was the son of your Imam and brother of your Imam - he uttered one word in truth, yet until now ye have called him a liar and reviled him. Observe and reflect how much injustice hath befallen helpless servants through the deceit and schemes of certain souls. At times they said the Books have been corrupted, at times they claimed the Quran is incomplete and the Proof is in occultation, and then they sent him to Jabulqa. Glory be to God! Have ye heard these words and yet fallen again into such vain imaginings? Or hast thou not heard and knoweth not? O Hadi! For God’s sake hearken, and for one hour free thyself from both love and hate. Observe the fruits of the Divine Tree and reflect upon the dawning of the Sun. The Living Waters are clearly distinguished from filth. This is that same Manifestation of whom the Primal Point declared “I am the first of them that worship Him,” and in nights and days was occupied with His remembrance and arose to serve Him. Reflect with fairness and speak with justice. This Wronged One had and hath no desire. By God’s life! Were there found one who could speak, He would choose silence, and were there found one who could arise, He would not arise. Ye know not the root of the Cause. Today whosoever hath attained to faith and drunk from the Kawthar of divine knowledge is accounted before God among the suns of the mirrors, although the Primal Point hath in one station complained even of the suns of the mirrors. This Revelation hath no need of that which the people possess. Verily He is the One manifest in His sovereignty, established by His signs, and all-compelling in His power. All are obliged to behold with their own eyes the Supreme Horizon, and this matter is specific to this Revelation. Some barkers have claimed the Bayan is corrupted - may God seal their mouths! They have spoken falsehood whereat the Holy Spirit lamenteth.</p>
<p>O Hadi! I ask one question and seek fairness: Among the divines from the beginning of Islam until the Day of Manifestation - those who adorned their heads with green and white turbans and counted themselves among the poles - did even one attain through the knowledge of being to the essence of the Purpose in the loins, or not? Be fair, for God’s sake! It is most regrettable that thou shouldst confuse thyself and others. With thine outward eyes thou hast seen how all the divines of Persia in the early years reviled from their pulpits the King of existence, and finally pronounced sentence of death upon Him. Now thou desirest to train such people? Fear God, O misleader, and refute not the truth with what thou hast. He counseleth thee for the sake of God, and I am the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Hear My call! Repent unto God Who created thee, sustained thee and guided thee. Then return unto Him, for He is verily the All-Forgiving, the Merciful. This is a Day wherein the ocean of His forgiveness hath surged and the sun of His bounty hath shone forth. Hasten, and be not of them that tarry. We have mentioned thee and counseled thee as a favor from Us. We desire from thee neither recompense nor reward. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this mighty stronghold.</p>
<p>Some opponents have fabricated calumnies and made them a snare for the monotheists and those near to God. Among these, a certain person in the Land of Ta has claimed that the people of Baha commit murder. Glory be to God! The heavens bear witness, the sun testifies, and likewise do all things, that this Wronged One, after arriving in Baghdad, strove with the utmost diligence to forbid killing, conflict and contention, even to the extent of words that might cause sorrow. The nights and days bear witness to what flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and what waves arose from the Most Great Ocean. Deeds bear witness to and verify words. From the day of Our turning toward Iraq until now, in no city has strife or conflict arisen. Every fair-minded person has testified and every just one has borne witness. Glory be to God! The people of the Bayan committed such deeds as caused the eyes of the people of the cities of justice and fairness to weep. Praise be to God that through the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen, most have attained to that which conduceth to the reformation of the world and the education of the nations.</p>
<p>Should anyone observe with an eye of fairness what is recorded in the Scriptures and Tablets, he would weep over the wrongs suffered by this Wronged One. Without helper or supporter, We summoned all the kings, as ye yourselves witness. Time and again We were cast into the prison of the enemy, sometimes with chains and fetters, at times wandering from land to land. All this happened for the sake of God and is as honey to the taste of them that are near and them that yearn for Him. The purpose of this Most Great Revelation and this Mighty Announcement, which all divine Books and Scriptures have extolled, has been to forbid conflict, strife, and the shedding of blood. Our intention is that through the living waters that flow from the Most Exalted Pen by night and by day, We might cleanse the hearts of the peoples of the world from rancor and hatred, that perchance through the power of the Manifest Sovereign this grievous affliction might be lifted. For the whole world is regarded as one homeland. Glory is not for him who loves his country, but for him who loves the world. These words bear witness to this Wronged One.</p>
<p>Moreover, We acknowledge what they have said. The people of the Furqan must not consider killing as cause and proof of falsity. These are words that the idolaters uttered during the time of the Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake. Thus in the Battle of Badr when the champions of the idolaters were slain, Asim ibn Abi Awf cried out: “O people of Quraysh! Beware of him who severs relationships, who divides the community,” and so forth. He said: “O Quraysh, do not withdraw from Muhammad, for he severs kinship and kills the sons of his uncles.” Many were the nights when the companions would enter people’s homes and behead their chiefs, bringing their heads to the presence of His Holiness. Furthermore, consider what transpired with the Banu Nadir and Banu Qurayzah, and likewise in the fortresses around Medina. By His command, Ali and Zubayr beheaded nine hundred souls in two days, and they either took possession of that people’s belongings or sent them to other regions and sold them. They dealt similarly with other tribes in ways I prefer not to mention. Open thine eyes and recognize the truth. Whatever ye say has been said before by the idolaters. In any case, this Wronged One’s purpose is to remove hatred, malice, strife and contention from the world.</p>
<p>O Hadi! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One. Pass beyond vain imaginings and hold fast to the sure cord of certitude. Move beyond idle fancies and turn thy face toward the Self-Subsisting Lord. By the life of God, he whom thou didst take from other than the Truth, thy Lord, and who stood before the Throne setting down verses, was led astray by him whom We expelled. Be not like the people of the Furqan. Speak not merely upon hearsay that which would ignite the fires of malice. O Hadi! Judge thou fairly concerning who issued the death warrant for the Most Holy Dayyan, and be not of the wrongdoers. The Primal Point dedicated the Book of the Temples specifically to His Holiness the Dayyan, saying: “As thy heart was gentle, sensitive and receptive, We entrusted this hidden knowledge to thee.” Yet they issued the warrant for his death and shed his blood. Likewise with Jinab-i-Abu’l-Qasim from the land of K - by the life of God they perpetrated that which the Pen is powerless to recount. Reflect upon this blessed and supreme utterance which hath shone forth from the Dawning-Place of the Primal Point’s exposition, and judge fairly. Addressing what ye suppose to be your Mirror, He saith: “Whatsoever thou understandest not of the utterances flowing from the Pen, ask thou of Siyyid-i-’Aziz” - and this referreth to Siyyid Husayn who was in the presence of the Point. O people! Be not among those who “placed their fingers in their ears lest they should hear the word of truth,” and be not of those who saw yet denied, who heard yet failed to acknowledge. O Hadi! The Cause is mighty, mighty indeed! Be not like the former people who clung to the hem of alteration, corruption, idle fancies and vain imaginings. The proof is clear, the path is manifest, the Cause is evident and the Truth is apparent. Turn thou unto it and be not of them that hesitate. I swear by the effulgent rays of the Sun of proof which shineth from the highest horizon of possibility - ye are heedless of the Truth and unaware of the essence of the Cause. Purify thine ear from hearkening to the words of the heedless, that thou mayest hear the call of God, and free thine eye from the film of idle fancies that thou mayest behold the highest horizon. The equivalent of all the books of the past and future hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will. Present thyself before the Face, then ask whatsoever thou desirest, that thou mayest witness the ocean of utterance and its waves, and the sun and its effulgence. Look thou upon the revealed Suras and reflect, that perchance thou mayest turn from the left hand to the right, from ignorance to knowledge, and from darkness to light. Deprive not thyself today of the splendors of His countenance, and be not a cause of leading others astray. Leave the helpless servants to themselves, that they may perchance find their way unto God. Reflect upon the recompense of the Shi’ih’s deeds on the Day of Judgment - what they said and what they did. All things have lamented their tyranny and the Most Exalted Paradise hath cried out because of their deeds. We beseech God the Most High to assist thee and those who have denied to return unto Him, to turn toward Him in repentance, to humble themselves before His gate, and to submit to His Cause. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Generous, the All-Bountiful, the Pardoning, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory! We have made mention of the friends of the earth in a remembrance from which the fragrance of bounty shall waft throughout the kingdoms of earth and heaven. Say: O people of God! Be not grieved. Reflect upon the deeds of the divines of Iran who considered themselves the most ancient, most learned, most discerning of all peoples and the most distinguished of all servants. In earlier years, all were occupied with rejection and cursing, and finally they issued that decree which caused the Pen to cry out and the Tablet to lament. Leave the deluded ones. Praise be to God, the bounty of Truth shines like the sun, manifest and evident, and the rains of His mercy are ever-descending and pouring down. The river of mercy flows - take of it in His Name and drink in remembrance of Him, despite those who have denied God, His verses, and rejected His greatness and sovereignty.</p>
<p>In all conditions, be engaged in serving the Cause and exalting the Word with joy and fragrance. Soon shall pass away the world and all that ye behold today, and there shall remain for you what hath been ordained from the Supreme Pen. The Tongue of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, beareth witness to this. Hold fast to unity and harmony, and be occupied with the triumph of the Cause. Victory in God’s Book hath ever been through deeds and character. We convey greetings and glory to each of God’s friends, and likewise to the handmaidens of that land who have drunk from the Kawthar of recognition and who gaze toward the horizon of the All-Merciful. All are mentioned in the Most Holy Court. Blessed are they whom the hints of the aggressive ones and the doubts of the infidels did not prevent or hold back from the Truth. These are they whose mention was made in previous Books and who are recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Tablet. The light shining and gleaming from the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O people of God, and upon those who are with you and who love you for His eternal, radiant, and luminous countenance.</p>
<p>As for the mention made of the companion of Varqa, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, it hath been heard. We beseech God, exalted be He, to strengthen him, aid him, and ordain for him what is best for him. Verily, He knoweth what profiteth him and what harmeth him, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: My God, my God! Withhold not Thy servants from the outpourings of Thy days, and deprive not Thy bondsmen from turning to the horizon of Thy Revelation. I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy knowledge, by the lights of Thy countenance, and by the Word through which Thou hast subdued Thy lands, to ordain for him who hath turned to Thee the good of this world and the next. Then deliver him through Thy power and might, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens! There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Conquering, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And as for the mention of the namesake of Ibn-i-’Attar, and likewise the other namesake, and Mirza Taqi Khan who have newly turned to the Faith - mention of each hath been made and recorded by the Supreme Pen. We beseech God to grant them power and strength that they may rend asunder all preventing veils and attain the station of revelation and witnessing. Ask God to make the mentioned souls aware of the greatness of His days and not deprive them of His fragrances. Say: O concourse of servants! By God, this is the Day of Reckoning, and the Lord of creation calleth in His most exalted voice from His most sublime horizon: Turn ye with radiant faces, and be not among the patient ones. Say: Today the gate of bounty is opened and the sun of grace is shining. Strive that ye may attain eternal blessing and everlasting, perpetual life. Thus doth the Mother Book teach you from His presence and guide you to His straight path.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of the handmaiden of God and her daughter. Consider thou the ocean of bounty and the heaven of grace. The divines of Persia and its doctors of law, each of whom considered himself an ocean of knowledge and a heaven of learning, remained deprived and forbidden from the recognition of Truth, while that handmaiden hath attained unto the knowledge of God and been adorned with the love of God. The Kingdom of grace is in His right hand of power, and the heaven of bounty is in the grasp of His authority. He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth and taketh from whomsoever He desireth. He doeth what He pleaseth and ordaineth what He willeth. He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Convey on behalf of the Truth greetings and counsel patience, inasmuch as the condition of this land is not known. Were that which is with Him to be revealed, grief would seize the inhabitants of all lands. This is the truth, no doubt is there about it, but most of the people are heedless.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Mirza Husayn repeatedly, and in each instance mention of him flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Praise be to God that he hath attained to service. Blessed is the house wherein the mention of God hath been raised and wherein His loved ones have attained to His presence, and blessed is the house which God hath made a shelter for them that are nigh unto Him and the sincere ones.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Praise thou the Desired One of all worlds that thou hast been mentioned by Him and succeeded in serving His Cause. Know thou the value of this station and seek thou assistance from the Truth. Blessed art thou and thy father and thy mother. We have made mention of you in such wise as shall never perish. To this testifieth every perceiving mystic and every informed sage.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding the sister of his honor ?, upon him be the Glory of God, and the degrees of sincerity of the mother - all have been and are mentioned in the Most Holy Court, and mention of them hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Especially for the sister, upon her be the Glory of God, there hath been revealed that from which the unitarians and they that are nigh have inhaled the fragrance of loving-kindness. They have ever been and continue to be remembered, and for each one specifically a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet hath been revealed. However, in view of wisdom, it was not fitting to send all at once; therefore there was delay in sending them. The loving-kindness of the Truth towards them is of such magnitude that every person of insight beareth witness and every person of understanding testifieth thereto. The people of that household have ever been and continue to be remembered. Convey greetings and glorification from the Wronged One and give them the glad-tidings of the grace and loving-kindness of the Truth, exalted be His glory. We beseech God to assist them in preserving that which hath been bestowed and to set them ablaze in such wise that the world and its might shall be powerless to prevent them. O Haydar-’Ali! These are servants and handmaidens whom God mentioned in the beginning of days and ordained for them that which the eyes of creation have not seen. Blessed are they and blessed is he who loveth them and blessed is he who hath visited the two shining lights. In all matters they should be mindful of wisdom. Thus hath the Lord of the worlds ordained in the Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>Verily We make mention of Husayn and his wife, and We give them glad tidings of the mercy which hath preceded all else, and We counsel them with that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of all worlds. We have created all things for the knowledge of My Self, and for standing before My presence, and for acting in accordance with what We have revealed in My Book. Thus hath the matter been decreed from before God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Among the people are those who have turned away from Me and disputed My verses which have encompassed all horizons, and who have pronounced sentence upon the shedding of My blood without any clear proof from Him or evidence from His presence. They are assuredly among the oppressors in the books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We beseech God to ordain for His loved ones the privilege of attaining His presence or the recompense of meeting Him. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O Husayn! The idolaters have interposed themselves between Me and My loved ones. Whenever anyone approacheth, an uproar ariseth. They are assuredly among those who perish. They are the ones who have separated bodies from spirits and horizons from lights. Thus have their souls enticed them, and today they are among the dead.</p>
<p>We have previously made mention of ’Abdu’l-Baqi and given him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy. Blessed is he and his wife. They have attained unto the service of My loved ones and My chosen ones. We beseech God to ordain for them that which shall be as a lamp unto them in the worlds of their Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. Convey My greetings unto him and say: Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named Siyyid Mustafa. We have remembered him and do remember him at this hour as a token of Our grace, for We are the All-Remembering, the All-Knowing. O Mustafa! Give thanks that thy name hath been brought before the Wronged One and that the Most Exalted Pen hath remembered thee from its lofty station. Beware lest anything among all things prevent thee from the Creator of heaven, or the might of those who have turned away from this manifest News cause thee to fear.</p>
<p>We make mention of him who is named ’Ali-Muhammad that he may rejoice and be of them that render thanks. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the remembrance of God in His days and whose pen hath moved in His name. He is assuredly among the triumphant in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. We counsel all with that which will draw them nigh unto the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O Ja’far! Hearken unto the Call which hath been raised from the precincts of the Prison by God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Be patient in that which thou hast purposed. Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient, and He biddeth thee to observe gracious patience. Take hold of the Cause of God and leave what the people possess. Thus doth He command thee from Whose presence is a mighty Tablet. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God. Verily He is with those who love Him, remember Him, and turn unto Him with radiant countenance.</p>
<p>O Haydar-’Ali! Upon thee be My glory! Thou didst make mention of the Deputy. Time and again hath mention of them proceeded from the Most Exalted Pen, and they have been and are remembered in the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to assist him to perform such deeds as are befitting the Day of God and to confirm him in supreme steadfastness. The world hath no significance and shall soon return to nothingness, while that which hath been ordained by the Most Exalted Pen shall endure and last forever. The Deputy is in truth counted among the servants of the Cause in the presence of God. Well is it with him. His reward is with Him Who hath raised him up for the service of His mighty Cause. Implore from God, exalted be His glory, his deliverance and sanctification. O Haydar-’Ali! The Most Exalted Pen hath, in the divine days, mentioned the souls who have turned towards Him solely because of their turning, for He hath been and is established upon the throne of grace. Were He to look to worthiness, the Pen would pause and cease its movement. With the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the All-Sufficient, the Most Exalted, on behalf of His friends, for that which beseemeth His bounty and generosity.</p>
<p>You mentioned Ali Haydar. He is blessed with Our grace, and his letters arrive continually. We beseech God to assist him in serving His Cause and to help him achieve that which is pleasing unto Him. Praise be to God that all the souls mentioned have been blessed with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. We convey Our greetings to the beloved friends in Abadih, upon them be My glory and loving-kindness. Say: O people of God! The names of all have flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. You must arise to assist His Cause with the utmost joy and fragrance. His bounty has encompassed you and His mercy has preceded all else. By the life of God! That which no eye in the world has perceived or comprehended has been ordained for His loved ones. Give thanks unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, for this tremendous bounty. Verily, He is with you under all conditions, He heareth that which proceedeth from your mouths and seeth your deeds, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>

<p>O He who is named after God, the Omnipotent!</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Mighty, the Most Impregnable, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from the Primal Point unto him who hath believed in God and His signs, and hath entered the Sacred Precinct, the dwelling-place whereon the throne of his Lord, the All-Merciful, was established, and hath heard what none among the worlds hath heard, that haply the breaths of the Spirit may so transport him that he shall be unable to remain in his place, and the attraction of the Almighty shall wrest from his hand the reins of free will, and cause him to speak, though by constraint, betwixt earth and heaven, and loose his tongue in utterance, and behold the Beauty of the All-Merciful in this Beauty that hath appeared and shone forth, then gleamed and glistened from the horizon of possibility with manifest and clear sovereignty - yet the people of the Bayan denied Him and cast at Him the darts of malice from every direction, after He came unto them upon the clouds of grandeur from the heaven of transcendent glory, and showed them God’s power and sovereignty, and sent down upon them at every moment that which would quicken the hearts of all created things, then the realities of existing things, then the temples of the Prophets and Messengers. But when they witnessed the signs of God and His sovereignty, then the manifestation of God and His power, they arose to oppose and destroy His exalted Self.</p>
<p>By God! There hath befallen Me that which hath befallen none before Me, and wert thou to hear, thou wouldst cry out within thyself and weep for this Wronged One, for Whom have wept the eyes of the denizens of the Supreme Paradise, then the eyes of them that dwell in the crimson depths, then the eyes of grandeur behind the pavilions of inviolable glory. And if thou shouldst ask them, “O people! By what proof have ye turned away from Him through Whom God’s Cause and sovereignty were made manifest?” thou wouldst hear from them as thou didst hear from the people of the Furqan when the heaven of idle fancies was cleft asunder and thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, came upon clouds of light in His name, the Most High, the Most Great. Nay, thou wilt find these more veiled than all previous peoples, for My previous Manifestation rent asunder all the veils whereby men in every age and era had been shrouded. Thus hath the command been sent down at this moment from the tongue of God, the Sovereign, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>And if thou shouldst ask the people of the Furqan, “Who is your Lord?” they will surely say, “God Who created us by His command.” And if thou shouldst ask, “Who is your Messenger?” they will say, “The Messenger of God whom He sent with the truth and made the Seal of the Prophets.” And likewise they enumerate names after Him whom thou knowest, and thus do they mention them and are among those who remember. They used to pride themselves above other peoples in what they possessed, yet when He appeared through Whose command their faith was established, their cause upraised, and their religion confirmed, they disbelieved in Him and became of the infidels. Consider then: did that which they possessed and spoke of for one thousand two hundred and sixty years profit them? Nay, by My Self, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate! For they worshipped names and clung to them without clear proof or illuminating Book, and took idle fancy as their lord instead of God. For had they known God, they would not have disbelieved in Him on the day when He appeared like the sun from the horizon of ancient glory. And thus know thou the people of the Bayan - if thou shouldst ask them in whatever manner thou desirest, thou wilt hear as thou didst hear from the people of the Furqan. They enumerate a specific number of those who were created by My firm, decisive, and mighty Word, and they pride themselves in a name among names after We created their kingdom by My Word - and God is witness and knower of this.</p>
<p>Among the deniers is one who claims that the Revelation hath appeared too soon, and that this is not the way of God as established of old. Say: Woe unto you, O concourse of deniers! Are ye more powerful than God and His Cause, or is He Who doeth as He willeth? And if ye acknowledge His power and sovereignty, He hath manifested Himself as He pleased and desired, and is not to be questioned about what He pleaseth. Verily, He is the Single One, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Say: Woe unto you! Ye acknowledge with your tongues that He doeth what He willeth and is not to be questioned about what He pleaseth, yet when there appeareth what He hath willed by His sovereignty, ye object to it and become of the deniers. Say: O people, look at the Cause itself and that which appeareth from Him, not at what ye possess. Thus have ye been commanded in all the Tablets, if ye be of them that are assured. For He hath ever been known through Himself, and all else is known through what the Pen of God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the All-Wise, hath traced upon their names.</p>
<p>O people! Fear God and deny not Him in Whom ye have believed after He hath come to you with all the signs and this Most Great, this mighty News. And among the deniers is he who saith that He hath claimed more than His station, and thus doth he weigh God’s Cause by his own measure, adding and subtracting, and becoming of the losers. When the verses of God are recited unto him with wondrous holy melodies, he raiseth his hand to his beard, then his face darkeneth - thus dost thou witness and art of them that bear witness.</p>
<p>And among them is he who saith these Tablets shall not endure upon the earth, nor this Name, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Most High, the Great. Thereby doth he seek to cure his malady and soothe the rancor in his breast and quench the fire of his envy. Verily, there is none all-encompassing save He Who knoweth the treachery of eyes and what the breasts of the rancorous conceal.</p>
<p>Say: By God! We have found you in such delusion as We have not found its like among nations of old, and God is witness and knowing of what I say. Say: Die in your wrath! By God, the Truth, every name that endureth on earth endureth by My command, were ye but aware. Every attribute that appeareth between earth and heaven is by My leave - thus hath the matter been decreed, though it be grievous to your souls, O concourse of the proud! Every mention that is raised on earth and ascendeth to heaven is My mention, the Mighty, the Inaccessible, the Exalted. All prostration, in whatever religion it may be, is unto My Beauty, the Shining, the Mighty, the Luminous.</p>
<p>Say: Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye slay Me with the swords of your rancor. By God, this is not from Me but from One Mighty and Beautiful. By God, were ye to look with the eye of fairness, ye would find in these words the fragrances of holy and generous sanctity. O people! Confuse not the Cause for yourselves and for others. By God, the melodies of God cannot be confused with others - to this testify the tongues of every knower and seer. Whenever I remain silent out of fear of you, the Herald calleth out above My head and the Spirit speaketh within My breast, and thus there appeareth from Me that which your souls and desires abhor, O concourse of the idolaters. O people! Blame Me not for this, for this is not from Me but from Him Who sent Me with the truth and made Me a guidance and mercy to the worlds. O people! Create not discord among men, nor invalidate the truth through your evil selves.</p>
<p>Do not refute the truth through your evil selves, and dispute not about the verses of God after they have been sent down in truth, and be not among the ignorant ones. Fear God, O people of the Bayan! These are the verses whereby God will adduce proof against you on the Day of Resurrection, and whereby the Beauty of the Divine Essence was established upon the throne of a mighty Name, and whereby God’s proof was perfected in every age and cycle, and His evidence, then His testimony and His light were made manifest to all the worlds. By God, O people, I do not boast to you of anything of My own self, but rather from the presence of One mighty and wise. O people, wrong Me not through wronging your own selves, and be content with how you have treated My beauty without permission from God, the King, the True, the Most High, the All-Knowing. By God, the eyes of all created things weep for what has befallen Me through your oppression, O company of polytheists. Then do the seas weep with their waves, and the trees with their fruits, and the leaves with their movements, and the lights with their radiance, if you would but reflect within yourselves. All things are disturbed by what has befallen Me and weep in their innermost hearts, if you would but perceive. O people, dispute not with Me concerning God’s verses, for they have been sent down by His command from His presence. Verily there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth. The Spirit hath taken from Me the reins of choice, and speaketh as It willeth through all My limbs and members, then My bowels and liver and veins and bones and hair, were you but to know. Had the choice been Mine, I would have held back the pen and not released it, but God hath released it by His command, and verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take Me not to task for this, but rather show Me mercy, O company of polytheists. By God, He sent Me on a day which was the king of days, around each moment of which revolve the might of time and the kingdom of creation, as a grace from His presence unto you, were you but to know. By God, this is He Who speaketh in all things that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Most High, the Most Great. Had the matter been in My hands, I would not have borne your persecution which the dwellers of the heavens and earth could not bear. And whenever I concealed Myself and remained silent from mention, God manifested Me in truth and the Spirit called out above My head that, by God, this is a noble King, and this is the Beauty of God among you, and His manifestation in your midst, and His radiance upon all created things. O people, by God, had the matter been in My hands, I would have fled from you to the mountain peaks as I fled from you the first time while you were heedless. But the matter hath been taken from My hands and your hands. Verily the command is in God’s hand - there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Most High, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. O people, have mercy on Me, then have mercy on yourselves, and dispute not about God’s verses, and refute not the truth with your mouths, and mock not the proof whereby your faith was established and your knowledge appeared, and whereby you pride yourselves above the people of the Furqan and the peoples of the earth who follow the Psalms and the Torah and the Gospel. Would you refute that whereby your faith was established? Woe unto you, O company of transgressors! And verily I fear not for Myself but for Him Who will come to you after Me with sovereignty and mighty power. By God, O people of the Bayan, after Me you will care for nothing […]</p>
<p>By God! O people of the Bayan! After Me ye care naught for aught and pronounce judgement against Him through a single letter of Whom the first and the last are raised up, and ye slay Him and drink His blood - nay, worse than this, even as the people of the Furqan did unto ’Ali before Nabil. By God! Ye are more cruel and more wretched! And verily He knoweth what is in your breasts and knoweth what is in the breasts of the deceivers. Would that thou, O My Name, hadst been with Us at the time when the Day-Star of the horizons departed from the precincts of Iraq, and witnessed that which none among all the worlds hath witnessed, and beheld him who warred against My Self, after thou knowest We had protected him and reared him and taught him, while he himself remained veiled behind a veil, fearful of himself. We stood against Our enemies, and God alone gave Us victory until We manifested the Cause after all the peoples had gathered for My death. Thou hast heard what befell Me at the hands of the hosts of the idolaters, and We stood against Our enemies in days wherein the souls of them that loved My Self were troubled, and then the hearts of them that had recognized Me, by reason of My tribulation. By God! By My deeds were astounded the denizens of the Concourse on High, then those who circle round the Throne of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. When the Beauty of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of glory and power, and the breezes of might wafted from the direction of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, then emerged they in whose hearts was rancor against this Youth, like serpents, after it behooved them to thank God for having strengthened them with the truth and aided them through this Youth Who stood firm in the Cause to such degree that the tongues of the people of the Concourse of eternity exclaimed: “Blessed be God for this most mighty, most holy, most great, and most wondrous steadfastness!” When God preserved Me from what they intended regarding the shedding of My blood, and aided Me with the hosts of the unseen, then they arose with schemes and deceit, and fabricated against Me all that they were capable of, desiring thereby to veil the beauty of the Sun with the veils of falsehood and calumny, and thus were they among the doers. If thou wouldst ponder My suffering, thou wouldst lament within thyself and weep for this Wronged One Who fell into the pit of hatred through that which the hands of these wretched ones have wrought. Then He crieth out: “Is there any helper who will aid Me with truth and repel from Me the evil of these calumniators? Is there any caller who will call out between the heavens and the earth concerning this most wondrous and most sublime Cause?” Know then that We loved thee before and now, and have mentioned thee in this Tablet with the melodies of them that are attracted, that the melodies of the Spirit might attract thee to the Sadratu’l-Muntaha, the seat of the throne of thy Lord, the Most High, and sever thee from all creatures. Verily, he in whose heart was hatred for thee desired to cause enmity between Me and thee, but God expelled him through His sovereignty, and the sun of love shone forth from the dawning-place of this blessed, holy, mighty, and generous Countenance, and He sent down upon thee verses of love and dispatched them to thee that thy heart might rejoice thereby and thou mightest be of them that are glad. O thou servant who art mentioned by the tongue of God! Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy by My sovereignty and power, then arise from the horizon of utterance with the wisdom of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wise. Then breathe into the servants the spirit of life from that which God hath imparted unto thee, that they might arise from their graves and be raised up with the ornament of God, the Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing. Take heed that thou fear no one […]</p>
<p>Say: O people! Know God through God, for this is the station which God hath ordained for you. If ye fail to attain unto this station, your names shall not be mentioned before God, and the angels of wrath shall return you to the nethermost hell. Do ye make mention of the Beloved while ye slay the Beloved of the worlds? Do ye call upon the Desired One while ye forget the Desire of them that have recognized Him? Do ye recite the verses while ye disbelieve in Him Who sent them down and revealed them? Woe unto you, O company of the heedless!</p>
<p>Say: O people! Purify your hearts and your souls from the Salsabil that hath flowed from the Kawthar of the mouth of your Lord, the Merciful. Deprive not yourselves thereof, and be not of them that are debarred. Say: This is God’s ocean that surgeth before you, moving through its own essence by its own essence. None hath reached its shore, how much less its depths, were ye of them that are fair-minded - save him whom God hath aided through His power and detached from all who are in the heavens and earth.</p>
<p>Say: O people of Baha! Speak in the name of God and through God, then embark upon the Ark of Eternity that saileth upon the crimson sea of grandeur in the name of your Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Highest. By God! Whoso entereth it is indeed saved, and whoso turneth away from it hath perished, even should he cling to all who have gone before and shall come after.</p>
<p>Say: Today nothing shall profit anyone except that he detach himself from all directions and turn toward this blessed, mighty and beauteous Shore. Cast behind thee all intimations, then all allusions from thy left hand, and take hold of the words of God with strength and detachment, then with mighty power. Convey unto the people the messages of thy Lord. He shall suffice thee in truth and guard thee from the harm of satans.</p>
<p>Know thou that they who were powerless to speak in the presence of the Countenance have written tablets in rejection of God and the Manifestation of His Self. Thus did their souls entice them, and they were of them that followed every rebellious satan. Verily he who turned away from God in former years - and thou art aware of him and what befell Me - when he repented We removed from him the garment of rebellion and clothed him with the robe of forgiveness. But when We arrived in this prison, he arose in opposition as commanded by his self and passion. God is witness and knoweth what I say. Were We to detail for thee what he hath committed, the tablets would not suffice, nor the ink, nor the pens, nor the tongues of all who dwell in the heavens and earth. He believed, then denied, then repented, then associated partners with God Who created him and fashioned him, through his own utterance that there is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all are before Him in this Book which hath appeared in truth and been inscribed in its heart by the finger of ancient glory. By God! This is verily God’s sanctuary in the most exalted assembly […]</p>
<p>By His mark inscribed upon his breast by the Finger of ancient glory! By God, this is verily the Sanctuary of God in the Most Exalted Concourse, the Holy Ka’bah in the cities of names, the fulfillment of the Divine decree in the kingdom of eternity, and the House of God amongst the worlds. Through His Name have the yearning ones ascended to the Lote-Tree of reunion, the lovers to the seat of glory and beauty, the sincere ones to the station of attainment and meeting, and the detached to the hidden refuge of impregnable security. Say: O people, fear God and dispute not with Him through Whom the call of the seekers is raised to the heaven of transcendent glory, through Whom the clouds pour forth their rain, the earth brings forth its fruits, the fountains of wisdom and utterance gush forth, and every wise matter is distinguished. Beware lest ye join partners with God or deny Him after He hath come to you from the Dayspring of the Spirit with clear evidences and manifest sovereignty, and hath aided you in His Cause and explained to you that which will draw you nigh unto His exalted and mighty Self.</p>
<p>Know thou, O My Name, that among the people are those who have objected to God, saying that He hath claimed a different station and rank each day. Say: Yea, by the Self of God, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing! We have indeed manifested Ourself each day in a different manner, and shall continue to manifest Ourselves as We please, in ever new ways. Say: Perish in your wrath, O concourse of malice! Have ye not heard that nothing whatsoever can occupy your Lord, and that He is at all times engaged in a fresh creation? Nay, were ye to ascend unto the heavens of knowledge, ye would witness that all We have created is continuously manifested in new ways, would ye but comprehend.</p>
<p>O thou Name mentioned before the Throne! Say to them: O people of the Bayan! Let Me set forth for you a parable, that perchance ye may inhale the fragrance of the spirit from the direction of your Lord’s wisdom and be of those who are convinced. If someone should go to the ocean and take from it a cup, then another handful, then another drop - doth the difference lie in the ocean or in those who have taken according to their capacity and capability? Be fair, then, O heedless ones! Say: By God, the ocean remaineth the ocean in its essence, and the sun remaineth the sun in its reality and is the Dayspring in its essence, shining upon all created things equally. It hath ever remained in one state and will forever continue thus. But ye perceive according to the measure of your sight and vision. Cleanse the rheum from your eyes caused by the veils of fancy and desire, that ye may behold it manifest, evident, rising, and shining upon all the worlds.</p>
<p>Thus have the hosts of wisdom and utterance descended upon clouds of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Merciful, that perchance the oppressed ones among the people of the Bayan might be led to the viewpoint of the All-Glorious, this resplendent, luminous, and radiant station. Say: By God, the sovereign verses have descended upon the shadows of names and attributes, and the matter hath been decreed from the presence of a mighty, transcendent, and august Sovereign. The words of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God Who created them and all things by His command have been struck down, for He is the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>By God, O My Name! Were We to utter a word, We would not wish to repeat it again - and God is witness to what I say. And whenever We have repeated words, We have intended in each one of them a meaning that none hath comprehended save My all-knowing and informed Self. By thy life! Had We found the people mature, We would not have repeated Our words[…]</p>
<p>And whenever We repeat the words, in each one of them We intend a meaning which none has understood save My All-Knowing, All-Informed Self. By thy life! Had We found the people to have attained maturity, We would not have repeated the words. Thou dost witness that whatsoever proceedeth from My Pen at every moment is of a wondrous nature. And verily, whenever We send down from the Kingdom of Glory and Power that which We send down, We do so in a manner suited to this creation. Were We to find them possessed of illumined vision, We would assuredly send down unto them at every moment that which would make them independent of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth, and We would teach them daily of the wonders of knowledge and wisdom. But since We have found their souls accustomed to fancy and imitation, therefore doth the Pen of Command reveal that which befitteth the condition of these weak ones. And this is a certain truth. By God! All that We have revealed from the beginning that hath no beginning hath been according to the capacity of creation, but the station of God is greater than this. Were He to reveal that which is worthy of His station, all who are in the heavens and earth would be thunderstruck, and the pillars of all created things would utterly cease to be.</p>
<p>Hearken unto what We revealed aforetime through the tongue of ’Ali-Qabli-Nabil: “O Qurratu’l-’Ayn! Stretch not forth thy hand in this Cause, for the people are intoxicated with the mystery. Verily, thou shalt have another turn after this Dispensation, by the Most Great Truth. There, reveal of the mystery a measure as small as a needle’s eye in the Most Great Mount, whereupon the people of Sinai shall perish at the dawning of a drop from that crimson, all-compelling Light, by leave of God, the All-Wise.” And He is God, Who hath ever been thy Guardian in truth, by the truth. Though We had informed the servants of Our later Manifestation and of the unveiling of mysteries beyond reckoning, and of the death of the people of Sinai, yet when We manifested Ourselves again under the Most Glorious Name and desired to unveil the mystery - even before We fully revealed it - the people of Sinai were struck down, as thou hast heard and wert among those who heard. Despite this, these people remained heedless within themselves and objected to Us, saying “How can the people of Sinai perish, and how can the sweet become bitter, and the mirror turn to stone, and fruits become dust?” Thus did they stray from the gardens of knowledge and were among the heedless ones. Say: Woe unto you! Those whom ye have taken as lords for yourselves and in whom ye take pride - their names were exalted because God’s mighty and powerful Pen hath flowed over them, and their mention was elevated through their faith in God, their Creator. But when they turned away, all they possessed was taken from them, and naught shall be accepted from them even should they worship as heavily as both humans and jinn. Reflect thou upon what We have revealed unto thee, and upon the state of these people who speak of that which they comprehend not. They have gone astray and led others astray through their own bidding and desires. Keep thyself apart from these people and abide in an impregnable sanctuary. By God, O My Name! The people have not fathomed the foundation of this Cause, for We have veiled it from them through what hath flowed from the Finger of Glory’s Pen of Wisdom. We desired beforetime, when thou wert present before the Throne, to unveil for thee what was hidden from the eyes of all creation, but We forbore and concealed it until thy Lord’s appointed time was fulfilled. Then did God’s Word appear adorned with His Own Self, the All-Encompassing, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O heedless ones! By God, this Bird hath melodies upon melodies, then songs upon songs, then warbles upon warbles, whereof if but the smallest fraction of one were to be revealed, the spiritual ones, then the people of Sinai, then the people of light, then the people of the divine cloud would fall senseless upon the dust of heedlessness and extinction, save him whom God preserveth through His grace from this Youth Who hath appeared with the Most Glorious Name in the Kingdom of Names. Every atom proclaimeth His praise, that there is none other God but He. He hath created all things through His Will, then through the mention of His Pen. Thus hath thy Lord’s dominion ever encompassed all worlds. O servant! Purify thou thy heart from all allusions, then call out with My call amongst My servants, that it may draw them away from their selves, detach them from indications, bring them nigh unto the Source of grace and bounty, and provide them from this Divine, Eternal, Most Holy Table whereof the mystics find all delights. Thus hath the Command descended from the heaven of sublime glory. Say: O people of Qum! Abandon what ye possess of words fit only for children to speak, then hearken unto the Most Great, Most Perfect Word of God from this Mouth from which floweth the Water of Life.</p>
<p>And He nourishes them from this Divine, eternal, Most Holy Table whereon the mystics find every delight. Thus hath the Command been sent down from the Supreme Kingdom of transcendent glory. Say: O people, abandon such words as befit children to speak, then hearken unto the Most Great, Most Perfect Word of God from this Mouth from which floweth the Kawthar of life, whereby all created things are quickened, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>O Qahir! Hear the call of thy Lord, the All-Compelling, from the direction of His Chosen Name. Be not veiled by veils and coverings, but emerge stripped of all save God; then speak forth between earth and heaven that which the Spirit proclaimed upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of Eternity, that perchance the servants may arise from the heedlessness of self and passion and hasten to the shore of wondrous glory. We named thee Qahir by the tongue of a previous Manifestation that thou mightest prevail over the idolaters in these days wherein they opposed God, the Lord of Names and Attributes, and sought to cut down the Tree of the Cause with the sword of rejection. Say: By God! This Tree shall be raised up by the waters of your rejection, though ye perceive it not within yourselves and are among the heedless. We have ever raised up the Trees of the Cause through the waters of rejection and blood, if ye be of those who know. Therefore, prevail thou over those who have disbelieved and fear no one. Place thy trust in thy Lord, the All-Merciful, that He may protect thee from those who have wronged among the people of the Bayan and aid thee with hosts ye cannot see. We are verily powerful over all things. Whenever thou desirest to aid thy Lord, the Most Great Spirit will assist thee by Our command. Be steadfast, be not disturbed, and be of the firm ones. By God, O Qahir! The Point of the Bayan at this hour, from the Most Glorious Companion, witnesseth the evil state of the people of the Bayan and calleth unto them at every moment, saying: “Shame upon you for what ye have done, committed, known, wrought and understood! Did We not counsel you in all the Tablets, saying: ‘O people! When the Ancient Beauty cometh unto you, oppose Him not, nor cling to aught for recognizing Him.’ Yet ye have done what neither the people of the Furqan did to My Self, nor the people of the Gospel to Muhammad the Messenger of God, nor the people of the Torah to My Son. Woe unto you, O company of oppressors! Have ye clung to him concerning whom We revealed that ‘whenever thou singest, a cock from among the cocks of heaven singeth, and whenever thou chantest, a bee from among the bees of light doth chant,’ while ye have turned away from Him around Whose Essence heaven itself, with its reality, its innermost being, its secret and manifest aspects, its outer and inner dimensions, its cocks and its bees and its birds, circle in adoration around a single leaf of the Tree planted in the courtyard of this Gate, before which the Spirit proclaimeth: ‘By God! This is indeed the Paradise wherein none hath comprehended what lieth therein of God’s manifestations and His grandeur, His conditions and His sovereignty, and around which circle the realities of the Prophets and Messengers every morn and eve.’ By God, O people of the Bayan! Ye have done what neither the Jews, nor the Magians, nor the people of the Furqan, nor the peoples of old from time immemorial have done, yet ye rejoice within yourselves and are among the jubilant. Soon shall God’s punishment seize you from every direction, and ye shall find for yourselves no refuge, nor helper, nor supporter, nor protector, nor guardian, nor guide. Have ye taken God’s Cause in jest or mockery among yourselves? Ye recite the words of children and pride yourselves therein, yet when one reciteth unto you words by a single letter of which the heavens and earth were created, ye look upon him as one in a swoon, and the dust of hell seizeth you. Fear ye God, O people, then repent and seek forgiveness, then return unto God Who created you for this Day, that He might expiate your evil deeds.”</p>
<p>Fear God, O people, then repent and seek forgiveness, then return unto God Who created you for this Day, that He may remit your evil deeds and forgive your transgressions. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>And thou hearest My words, then take counsel from thy Lord’s admonition. By God! Baha hath not spoken save out of love for thee. Guard thyself - thy soul, thy spirit, thy being, and thy essence - from those who play with clay. Thus do We command thee and reveal unto thee that which shall make thee independent of all else but Me, and shall establish thee upon a mighty steadfastness.</p>
<p>And the Glory rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee and upon those who love thee for the sake of God, thy Lord, and who hearken to thy words concerning this Cause at which the skins of the polytheists have quivered. And praise be to the Beloved of the mystics and the Goal of all worlds.</p>

<p>=== START BH00128 ===</p>
<p>May the beloved and august bearer of the Name 66 [Allah-u-Zain], upon whom be all the most glorious splendor of God, observe with his radiant gaze:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His glory, the Greatness and the Power!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested through wisdom, revealed His Cause through wisdom, commanded all through wisdom, and made victory to reside in utterance and wisdom. Exalted is the Lord of wisdom and the Manifestor of wisdom, Who hath made it sharper than swords, more penetrating than spears, and more piercing than arrows. Praise be to God Who, when He was established upon the throne in the garden named Ridvan, uttered three decisive verses: by the first He abolished the law of the sword and established in its place mention and utterance; by the second He manifested all names unto all things. Exalted is the Creator of heaven Who spoke that whereby the earth and all therein were attracted, save those who clung to what they possessed and cast away what was with God, the Lord of all mankind. I pray, offer salutations, and glorify those who acted according to what they were commanded and followed what God revealed in the scriptures and tablets. My spirit be a sacrifice for your remembrance! The servant hath attained to that which shone forth from the horizon of your pen, which moveth only to celebrate the praise and glory of God, to manifest His Cause and exalt His Word. When my heart was illumined by that radiant light, I approached the seat of the throne. When I arrived, I presented what was in your letter. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur spoke in the kingdom of utterance - and verily He is the proof for all who dwell in the realm of possibility - saying, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One!</p>
<p>O My Name! Be thou ready to hearken unto the call of thy Lord. Verily, the Self-Subsisting remembereth thee with the most exalted remembrance, the Beloved calleth thee with the sweetest call, He Who is remembered mentioneth thee with the most glorious mention, and the Desired One turneth toward thee with His face that endureth after the passing of all things. Exalted is the Lord of Names Who, when established upon the throne, uttered a word whereby the earth and all therein were shaken, save every heedless one who clung to an idol among idols. Say: O people of Iran! The All-Merciful hath come to draw you nigh and teach you what behooveth man. You turned away and denied until you pronounced judgment against Him by Whom the eyes of the messengers whom God sent unto His servants were solaced. Say: He commanded you to goodness, but you chose evil, and there appeared from you that which caused the trees to lament. Say: By God! The Interlocutor of the Mount hath come! He is the One promised unto you in the scriptures and tablets. Say: Beware lest your conditions prevent you from God, the Lord of lords. Leave what you possess and hold fast to that which the Mother Book hath uttered before all faces, as a command from God, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. O Zain! Glorify on My behalf those among My loved ones who have cast aside all else but Me and have drunk the choice wine of My mercy from the hand of My bounty. Then command them according to what hath been sent down from the heaven of My will and the kingdom of My purpose. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower. We have counseled them with wisdom and with that which will elevate their stations in the contingent world. Say: Be ye God’s trustees on earth and the emblems of His remembrance amidst mankind. Consort with all people in a spirit of joy and fragrance, such that no heart be saddened by you nor the hearts of those whom God hath created by His command be troubled. Verily, He is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Al-Hadba and other lands! By the life of God, the Supreme Pen hath turned toward you and maketh mention of you with the most glorious remembrance, revealing unto you the pearls from the ocean of your Lord’s wisdom, the Lord of all days. Blessed is he for whom God hath ordained a portion of that which hath appeared from the ocean of His grace, which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who have recognized the decree of the Beginning and the Return.</p>
<p>O Zayn! God willing, thou shalt be illumined and radiant through divine grace. Praise be to God that thou hast not been negligent in serving the Cause and spreading the divine verses. This station is most exalted. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Zayn of the near ones! We have summoned all servants to the highest horizon and guided them to the divine ocean of knowledge. Likewise, We have commanded all to aid the Cause, and We have mentioned with clearest utterance the assistance that hath been revealed in the divine words. Nevertheless, it is observed that some are heedless of the meaning of assistance and what God hath intended thereby, that is, they have not understood. A hundred thousand regrets that the people of Baha are still unaware! Some have interpreted and continue to interpret assistance according to their own desires, although from the Supreme Pen countless times hath this most glorious word been revealed: The assistance of God’s Cause hath been and is through wisdom and utterance, not through violence and corruption. We have forbidden all from conflict and corruption, yet they have not desisted, for they are unaware of the purpose. And souls who arise for God’s sake and remind the people are and have been rare. Therefore, most remain in their own vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Inform the people of Nun and Jim of the divine commandments. All must hold fast to that which the Truth uttereth and must prefer God’s Will to their own will and know God’s Purpose to be sovereign and paramount over their purpose. At times the Truth, exalted be His glory, with a single word subdues and conquers the world. Whosoever hath been blessed to read the Surih of Ra’is and its like becometh somewhat aware of divine power. And at times when they cause harm to the Self of Truth, the Truth is seen to remain quiet and patient. All matters proceed according to wisdom, but since the servants are unaware, they are sometimes content and sometimes complainant.</p>
<p>In this Most Great Revelation, the decree of the sword, corruption, conflict, disputation and the like have been strictly forbidden in the Book. If today someone should manifest evil intent toward the Wronged One, We would certainly not oppose him. In this Revelation, the ocean of loving-kindness is surging, the sea of grace is manifest, and the sun of generosity is shining. Some of the friends in the land of Nun and Jim are unaware of these stations. Convey greetings to them from the Truth and explain the meaning of assistance so that all may become aware of what is beloved in God’s sight. Although the hearts of the loved ones are wounded by the deeds of the oppressors - indeed the serpent and the wolf have committed that which hath caused the Messenger to lament in the most exalted Paradise, and the Holy Maiden in the highest Heaven, and the Supreme Pen in this most glorious station - nevertheless, obedience to God’s command and submission to His ordinances are necessary and obligatory. All ears and eyes must be attentive to see what will appear from the horizon of the Cause.</p>
<p>Let eyes be watchful to see what will appear from the horizon of the Cause and what command will issue from the Tongue of Grandeur. If anyone should commit that which is contrary to the will of God and His manifest command, the injury thereof will revert upon the Truth Itself. Should anyone today harass or injure any of God’s enemies, he hath not aided the Truth and will not be accounted among its helpers in the Book, for he hath acted against God’s command and moreover hath caused injury to the Truth and His loved ones. All matters are conditional upon the confirmation and acceptance of the Truth. O My loved ones! Set aside whatsoever ye wish and desire, and take what ye are commanded by God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Place your trust in God concerning what hath come upon you and hold fast to patience and forbearance. This is better for you, as His wise Book doth testify.</p>
<p>Some time ago, in answer to one of the friends who imagined he was rendering assistance but who in reality was causing harm to the Cause, these exalted words were revealed from the Dayspring of the Will of the Lord of Names and Attributes. His words, exalted be His grandeur: Beware, beware lest thou do what thou wrote at the end of thy letter. These are the deeds of the ignorant and the acts of the heedless. I swear by the Most Great Name that if any of the friends should injure anyone, it is as though he hath injured the Truth Itself. Conflict, disputation, corruption, murder and the like have been strictly forbidden in God’s Book. Turn unto God in repentance for what thou didst intend, then return unto Him and say:</p>
<p>O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Word to ordain for me the word of forgiveness, for I have intended in my soul that which Thou didst not desire and which Thou didst forbid in Thy Book. I beseech Thee to remit my evil deeds and immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Every injustice manifested by an oppressor - leave him to the Truth Itself. The hand of divine justice is all-encompassing and all-pervasive. There is no need for corruption, conflict, disputation, murder and pillage. The victory of the Cause hath been and will be through utterance, and anything else stems from the promptings of self. God protect us and you, O concourse of those who have turned unto Him.</p>
<p>Many such exalted words have been revealed in these days so that all the friends may become aware of the divine will and not commit that which would cause harm to God’s Cause and injury to His chosen ones and holy ones. Verily He knoweth and judgeth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about him who ascended to the Supreme Companion and what remained of him - these matters were presented before the Most Holy Court. He said: “We have accepted this and have entrusted it to Zein. He may do with it as he pleaseth.” He also said: “The luminous countenance - upon him be My glory and My light - We have likewise entrusted to Zein.” Both matters have been accepted and are referred to you. The Command is in His hand, and He is the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As to what you mentioned concerning Aqa Muhammad Husayn, mention of him had previously been made in the Most Holy Court, and a most mighty and impenetrable Tablet specially revealed for him from the heaven of loving-kindness was dispatched along with Tablets for the land of H, which were sent from the direction of the land of Qaf. God willing, he will attain unto these. And again mention of him was made in the Most Holy Court, and the Sun of loving-kindness shone forth and appeared from the horizon of grace. God willing, he will attain unto these glad-tidings.</p>
<p>Likewise mention of Aqa ’Abdu’l-Vahhab was made in the Most Exalted Holy Court. This is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke forth in the Kingdom of Utterance:</p>
<p>He is the Most Great!</p>
<p>O Vahhab! The Wronged One Who hath spoken forth what He was commanded by God, the Lord of the worlds, maketh mention of thee. The world hath been illumined by the Luminary of Revelation, and yet most of the people are heedless. Among them are those who heard and denied, those who saw and turned away, and those who turned with clear certitude toward God. Blessed is the heart that hath attained unto recognition and the eye that hath beheld His luminous horizon. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause in such wise that the intimations of the polytheists deter thee not. Act in accordance with what thou hast been commanded in the Book of God. He will aid thee and be with thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy!</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named with Alif and Qaf (Aqa Jan), that he may hear what was heard by the ears of them who are nigh, who have cast the world behind them and turned with clear certitude toward the Lord of Eternity. These are servants whom neither swords deterred nor arrows frightened in this firm and wise Cause. When thou attainest unto the Book of thy Lord, take hold of it with such strength as is vouchsafed by God, the Strong, the Mighty. This is a Day wherein fruits have appeared and mysteries been revealed, and yet most of the people remain heedless. This is the Day of Recompense, and yet most of mankind remain turned away. Blessed is he who turned toward God when the Call was raised from His noble station. The glory shining forth from the horizon of grace be upon them that have believed in God, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>And as to what was written concerning Aqa Muhammad Javad, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], this is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke forth:</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh the truth!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Javad! Verily We behold the two matters in the two most evident mysteries: once We made mention of the land of Sad in that which caused the world to smile, and once in that which caused the Lord of nations to lament. Observe then the mercy of God and His grace, and what the serpent hath wrought. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O land of Sad! We counsel thee regarding the trusts of God and His chosen ones. Thus did We counsel thee aforetime when My Most Exalted Pen moved and lamented over what befell the Cause at the hands of them that wronged and denied the right of God when He came with manifest sovereignty. Say: O My loved ones! Sorrows have overtaken you by reason of what hath befallen you. Rejoice ye this day in that the countenance of the Ancient Beauty hath turned toward you from His most exalted horizon and maketh mention of you in that which caused the hearts of the sincere ones to be attracted. Thus hath My tongue spoken forth in My Kingdom of utterance as a token of My grace, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. The glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have migrated in My path and borne hardships in My love, and upon every assured and steadfast one.</p>
<p>Concerning the two maidservants about whom you wrote, regarding what they had done, this was presented at the Most Holy Court. No response issued forth from the Dayspring of the Cause, and they commanded to present another matter. Therefore this servant is uncertain whether they will later be blessed with the word of forgiveness or not. The Command is in the hand of God, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the departed wife of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, which you wrote about - this was presented. He, exalted be His grandeur, said: “Verily she hath attained unto forgiveness. We made mention of her before with beautiful remembrance.” Now she is free from the turbidities of this dust-laden world and, with utmost joy and fragrance, is dwelling and moving in the Supreme Horizon. Upon her be the Glory of God, His mercy, His praise and His remembrance. End quote.</p>
<p>And likewise, concerning Karbila’i Aqa Jan, these clear verses were sent down from the heaven of loving-kindness. His word, exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Rememberer and the Remembered[…]</p>
<p>O Letter Qaf between the two Alifs! Hearken unto the Call of the Meeting Place of the Two Seas from these two Most Exalted Names, at whose appearance the heaven was cleft asunder, the earth was split open, the Cry was raised in truth, and every firm pillar was shaken. Through them the Qaim appeared and gave glad tidings to the people of the Qayyum, at Whose manifestation the birds warbled upon the trees. God hath come with a Cause before which all the hosts of the earth combined cannot stand. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in His mighty prison. Say: Through My Name the Kingdom of Names appeared, and through My Call the Call was raised from the Dawning-Place of Glory, and by My Command all who are in the heavens and earth were thunderstruck, save those whom We preserved, rescued and delivered. And I am verily the Powerful over what I will, and I am the Mighty. Thus were the hosts of revelation arrayed in the form of words in these lines which have appeared in this luminous Tablet. When thou attainest unto My Book, rejoice and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!</p>
<p>Whatever wealth they plundered in the land of Sad, and from every drop of blood that was unjustly shed in that land, countless beings have perished and continue to perish. Likewise, slumber hath not overtaken and will not overtake the wealth of Truth - it is ever wakeful and aware. Assuredly shall the oppressors be tormented by the fruits of their deeds. From the manifestation of one deed of Ubaidullah the Second, there appeared and was committed that which Ubaidullah the First had shunned. Lo! The curse of God be upon the wrongdoing people! Nothing hath appeared or will appear without cause and effect. Consider how many souls have perished and how many towns and dwellings have returned to dust and are now seen as barren plains. This is the portion today, and what shall come to pass hereafter God alone knoweth. Think not that the loved ones who were slain amid this by the swords of oppressors were lost. I swear by the Sun of the Kingdom of Truth that every soul among the friends of God who in that event drank the cup of martyrdom ascended to the Supreme Horizon and now dwelleth at rest beneath the canopies of God’s mercy. Were those stations to be revealed even to the extent of a needle’s eye, all would cry out “Would that I had been with them!” And every friend who suffered outward loss - that was and is complete gain. The people of Baha have been and are in magnificent gain. If in any day of days and time of times, some loss should occur in accordance with divine wisdom’s requirements, one must not grieve over it. God will assuredly adorn it with the ornament of supreme gain. Verily He is the Truth, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>As you wrote stating that His honor Aqa ’Azizu’llah from the Land of Kha had requested that you mention him in the Most Holy Court and seek bounties on behalf of the friends in the Land of Kha - Mulla ’Ali, Aqa Mirza Kazim, Aqa Khudadad, Aqa Shahvardi and others, upon them be the Glory of God - all were mentioned in the Most Holy Court. In these days especially, from the heaven of Will, Most Holy Tablets have been revealed for each one, and likewise exalted and wondrous verses concerning the loved ones of the Land of Kha have flowed from the Supreme Pen. Now two posts specifically for the Land of Kha have gone, and another will go this week, and likewise next week or the week after. Yes, previously there were delays for some time, through His wisdom, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. They commanded that His honor Zayn should give them glad tidings of the Tablets and what was revealed for them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding those two handmaidens who after being mentioned were not blessed with the expression of favor, at this time the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoke these words: “O thou servant who art present, We once declared to His honor Zayn that if he were to intercede for even the most wretched of people, We would accept it. Therefore divine forgiveness encompassed their condition. He is verily the Forgiving, the Generous.” [It is submitted that truly their deeds were most reprehensible. It was purely through kindness to that honored one that the word of forgiveness was heard from the mouth of the All-Merciful’s grace. His is the praise and favor. Furthermore,]</p>
<p>[They commanded to write to His honor Zayn that he should observe great wisdom. The power of Islam has begun to weaken. This has not been and is not except due to the heedlessness of the heedless ones and the oppression of the oppressors. No one has attempted to remedy it and what is worse, they have not even understood the cause of the weakness. In their vain imaginings they have increased their ignorant zeal and useless prejudices. Therefore great care must be taken. Some people are introduced in the name of friendship, love and acceptance so they may become informed of the Cause. In any case, they have placed and do place spies. All friends should observe wisdom. They should not believe every speaker, accept every seeker, trust every newcomer, or reveal to every flatterer. Thus does the Wronged One counsel His loved ones and friends out of His grace.]</p>
<p>[In these matters great care must be taken. If they would observe with the eye of fairness and keep in view the side of truth, all would approach this Most Exalted Cause with complete humility. But since they soar on the wing of passion and look with the eye of tyranny, therefore the veiling of signs and tokens is most fitting and appropriate. Now they know the pain for they see it, but they are heedless of the Physician and remedy. They have considered pure justice as oppression and pure good as evil. Thus have their souls seduced them while they perceive not.]</p>
<p>O Ali-Akbar! The Speaker of Sinai in this Dispensation hath spoken thus: “Glory is not his who loveth his country, but glory is his who loveth the world.” This utterance hath, ere this, shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of God’s holy Tablet. Well is it with them that comprehend! O Ali, make all aware that they may discover and understand the true meaning of assistance as revealed in God’s Book from the heaven of His Will. Let them not consider corruption to be reform, nor count murder and plunder among the means of rendering aid. True assistance is through utterance and that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Book. Under all conditions, exert your utmost effort that the fragrance of discord may be wholly dispelled and the sun of unity and concord may shine forth from the horizons of hearts. God willing, the fruits of this endeavor shall appear and its effects become manifest through earnest striving.</p>
<p>O Zein! In these special days a most wondrous and impregnable Tablet was revealed and sent to the aforementioned soul. God willing, may he attain to that which He loveth and is pleased with, and may he achieve true martyrdom in this divine Day. Convey to him My glad-tidings and mention unto him that which My tongue hath uttered in the kingdom of My utterance.</p>
<p>As for what thou didst write concerning Haji Kazem, Mirza Hassan and Aqa Ali, upon them be the Glory of God, this is what the Tongue of the All-Merciful hath spoken:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy</p>
<p>O Kazem! Thy mention hath come before the Wronged One, and this mighty, impregnable Tablet hath been revealed for thee. We have mentioned thee before and mention thee now as a favor from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Grieve not over anything. Rejoice in that the Most Exalted Pen remembereth thee from this sublime station. Today, every soul must engage in service to the Cause, and the service and triumph of the Cause hath been and shall ever be teaching, as well as unity and harmony among the loved ones, and showing consideration and fellowship toward one another. O Kazem! Hold fast unto that which God hath desired, for it is better for thee than that which thou desirest. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Wise, the All-Informed. God willing, mayest thou be occupied in service to God’s Cause with supreme steadfastness. Today this service taketh precedence over all deeds. Thus doth the Clear Book command thee. O Kazem! We make mention of the Kazem who was martyred in My path and sacrificed his soul for love of Me. By God’s life! He hath attained to a station whose description hath left the tongues of the mystics powerless.</p>
<p>He is the Most Great, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>O Hassan! There hath befallen this Name that which caused Hussein to lament in the Most Exalted Kingdom and made the eyes of the denizens of Paradise to shed tears, yet the wrongdoers are in evident joy. Soon shall the breezes of chastisement from God, the Lord of all worlds, overtake them. Blessed is the visitor who visiteth him and the seeker who seeketh his holy resting place. We make mention of him and his brother as a favor from Us, and We are the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing. God willing, mayest thou be blessed with divine favors and act according to that which God hath desired. Given the upheaval in these realms, pilgrimage to this land is not advisable. Trusting in God, remain occupied with the mention of the Beloved of all possibility in the lands of Iran. He recordeth for those who hold fast to goodness the reward of them that have attained. Glory be upon those who have hearkened to My call and acted according to that which was commanded by Me.</p>
<p>In the name of the Peerless Lord, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>O Ali! My name Zain mentioned thee, and the Supreme Pen hath turned toward thee from this Most Glorious Station that perchance thou mayest be set ablaze by the fire of divine love in such wise that thou mayest become freed from thine own will and desire and wish, and hold fast unto the Will of God. With utmost joy and fragrance, busy thyself with the remembrance of the Goal of all the worlds. To turn towards these lands is contrary to wisdom. Whosoever is with God, God shall be with him. This is the unique pearl of the ocean of knowledge: “Be thou for Me that I may be for thee.” Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance. Blessed is he who hath heard and rendered thanks.</p>
<p>He is the Most Great, the Most Ancient</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Beware lest thy desire prevent thee from the Will of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Verily He knoweth, judgeth, seeth and remembereth. Thy Lord is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Be thou as one extinct before the manifestations of His Cause and content with what God hath ordained in the Book. It behooveth thee to move by My Will and walk in My Path. Thus doth the Revealer of verses teach thee. Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee these verses whereby the horizons have been illumined. By the life of God! All that hath been created on earth cannot equal one word thereof. He Who hath spoken beareth witness that there is none other God but Me, the One, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>And regarding what thou didst mention about Mulla Alijan, upon him be the glory of God, God willing whatever hath been revealed in these stations along with the two pages of questions concerning the Most Holy Book and the Book of Prayers shall be sent. At present this servant is engaged outside the city in the presence of His Countenance, and what hath been revealed in these stations is not at hand.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about Haji Muhammad who is among the relatives of the honored guest, upon her be the glory of God, it hath been presented and there hath been heard from the Tongue of Grandeur that which sufficeth him throughout the duration of the kingdom and the realm. The servant conveyeth greetings unto him and giveth him glad-tidings of the favors of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou didst mention about the wife of Muhammad-Qabli-Ali, upon him be the glory of God, it hath been presented before His Countenance and the Desired One hath answered in such wise that all the tongues of the world have become submissive to it and the Pen hath moved upon it from time immemorial. And this is a mention that appeareth thus; otherwise, what have I to do with mentioning one whom none among all created things hath known? Exalted, exalted is He above my description and the description of those above me. Give that leaf glad-tidings of God’s mention.</p>
<p>The servant hath attained the presence and presented that which was submitted by him who was named Muhammad-Qabli-Sadiq. When the Desired One heard it, He spoke - and His utterance is the sweetest - “Blessed is he for having spoken with kindness and mentioned that which was befitting to mention. Joy be unto him and unto whosoever hath turned unto him in the path of God.” O Zain! Such deeds as these are most beloved in the sight of the Wronged One. Convey My greetings unto them both and give them glad-tidings of My mention. Say: “O My servant, upon thee be My glory! O Hasan! Thou hast heard and acted upon what the Tongue of God spoke aforetime in His words ‘Do good as God hath dealt well with thee.’” We make mention of the loved ones of God in that place and convey Our greetings unto them, and We pray for those who have held fast unto righteousness and acted according to what they were commanded in the Book. Give them glad-tidings and remind them. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>Another submission: since a Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet has been specifically revealed from the heaven of God’s will for his honor Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’llah, upon him be the glory of God and His favors, this servant did not presume further, and surely this excuse is acceptable. We beseech the Most High to assist us in serving His Cause in all conditions. Mention of self-effacement and nothingness from this servant is suspended and contingent upon your honor’s favors. God willing, may all drink from the ocean of divine knowledge with utmost joy and gladness, with certitude and assurance, and be occupied with the mention of the Peerless Friend. Glory be upon your honor and upon those who hearken to your words and your utterance in the Cause of God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>Another submission regarding His Holiness Ismu’llah-i-A?daq, upon him be, from all glory, its most glorious: This Most Holy, Most Exalted utterance was revealed at this time, His mighty and glorious Word: “Verily We make mention of Our Name, the Most Truthful, who traveled through the lands until he attained the presence at the Gate and heard what Moses heard on the Mount of Knowledge from the tongue of the loving-kindness of his Lord, the All-Merciful. Blessed is he and blessed is he who maketh mention of him through that which hath been sent down from the Supreme Pen from God, the Cleaver of the dawn and the Lord of Names.” End.</p>

<p>The esteemed beloved, His Holiness the Name 66 [Allah] Zein - upon him be all the glory of God, the Most Glorious - may take note:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted be His station, the Greatness and the Power</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested His Cause, perfected His proof, and completed His testimony in such wise that the dwellers of the realms of might and the denizens of the kingdom have borne witness thereto. Blessed is he who hath been just in the Cause of God, exalted be His glory, and blessed is the learned one who hath turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon, and blessed is the one endued with understanding who hath testified to that which the Tongue of Grandeur testified before the creation of all things.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Aid Thy servants unto that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and will cause them to recognize that which will profit them in Thy worlds. O Lord! The suns of understanding have been eclipsed by the veils that have come between Thee and them from Thy creation, and the moons of acknowledgment have been darkened by the clouds that have come between Thee and them from Thy creatures. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy tribulation after Thy power to send down from the heaven of Thy mercy that which will purify the eyes of Thy servants and cause to grow in their hearts the roses of equity concerning Thy Cause and Thy Manifestation. Thou art He Who hath ever been powerful over whatsoever Thou hast willed and dominant over whatsoever Thou hast created. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>And thereafter, His Holiness’s letter dated the first of Jamadi’l-Avval transformed the smoke of sorrow into the light of joy, for in these days successive letters indicating the arrest of the friends of God, exalted be His glory, had arrived from His Holiness the Name of God - upon him be all glory most glorious - and his honor, the beloved of the heart, ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar - upon him be the glory of God, Lord of Power. However, all correspondence before and after spoke of the exaltation of the Word and the manifestation of the Cause without any veil or covering. Both from His Highness the noble prince and likewise from another prince, satisfaction was expressed. They attended multiple gatherings and recited some of the verses and passages. As soon as His Holiness the Name of God learned that His Highness the Crown Prince, the Regent, was seeking him, he himself wrote and sent a letter to him, the substance of which was: “I have heard that you have summoned this servant. I am at your service and will present myself whenever you specify.” Subsequently, His Highness the Most Noble received him with utmost love at the appointed time. All manner of subjects were discussed and the meeting passed in complete joy and delight. Similarly, another meeting took place, and with his honor ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar - upon him be the glory of God - repeated meetings were held and detailed discussion of divine verses and evidences occurred. The true effect and fruit of this is not known. This much became clear and evident to them: that God, exalted be His glory, has in this Most Great Revelation strictly forbidden killing, plunder, corruption, and conflict and contention in the Book. However, the ignorant ones of that land who are known as divines arose in clamor. The dust of their suppositions and imaginings surrounded that holy and blessed city. Glory be to God! Until when will they turn away and object and say what they do not understand and speak of what they do not comprehend? The cause and reason for these matters in the first instance was the lack of observance of wisdom. His Holiness the Wronged One, meaning the Name of God - upon him be all glory most glorious - in correspondence sent to this servant has greatly complained about the unwisdom shown in the Land of ?a. In one letter he wrote that “this servant was invited to a place, but upon arrival it was observed that fifty or sixty of the friends were gathered. I said: ‘Have you not heard of wisdom, that it has been ordained that gatherings should not exceed nine persons?’ Similarly, other gatherings were observed. If I did not attend it would cause offense. When I went, it was observed that the word of wisdom had no effect and the number exceeded the known rule.” And he wrote: “Praise be to God, the Land of ?a is adorned with the presence of the chosen ones, the saints and the beloved, and all are enkindled with the fire of love. The only thing observed contrary to this was that they did not observe wisdom, and out of complete sincerity, they would consider anyone who claimed belief to be a believer and confidant.” As such, one of the hypocrites, claiming belief, attended gatherings and assemblies and afterwards related all details to his chief, who has returned to hell.</p>
<p>And afterward all details were conveyed to their chief who has returned to hell, and that wicked one became the cause of uproar and corruption, issuing a decree for the shedding of pure blood. However, the hand of God’s wrath gave him no respite and returned him to the worst abode, that is, to the lowest of the low. Nevertheless, his like have not been warned, and the uproar has grown more intense. In all ages and centuries, the ignorant ones who were known by the name of learned have been the cause and source of corruption. His Holiness Ismu’llah had written that the government was in no way interfering, but the clamor of the ignorant has risen to such a degree that the state is compelled to arrest and imprison. In any case, this evanescent servant beseeches the True One, exalted be His glory, to awaken those who sleep, grant sight to the blind, bestow awareness to the heedless, and adorn the learned of the age with fairness. In truth, these people have been and continue to be sightless, heedless, sleeping, ignorant, agitators, corrupters and oppressors. God protect us and you from the evil of these people who have sought to extinguish the light of God in every age, as attested by traditions and accounts, and beyond them the Book of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>We beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to protect the Wronged One and all who are wronged from the evil of oppressive, treacherous, and deceitful souls. Verily, He has power over all things. This was a summary of the events in the Land of Ta that was submitted. Surely His Holiness has by now been informed of the events in that land.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Feast in the name of the True One, exalted be His glory, and the marriage ceremony - praise be to God, it has been accepted with favor. He says, and His sweetest utterance is: “O Zayn, God willing, may you be a pillar of the House of Justice.” And the dawning-place of the manifestation of Rida Ismu’llah and Ali-Qabli-Akbar and a group of friends are caught in the claws of hatred. Although outwardly the state authorities have shown consideration and tolerance and have conducted themselves with love, yet the uproar of the ignorant, namely the clergy, has risen with wickedness and audacity. It behooves you to beseech God, your Lord, night and day to protect His loved ones and chosen ones from the evil of those who have denied the rights of God, before and after.</p>
<p>You know the Shi’ih clergy - despite the ignorance that encompasses their outer and inner being, they are so proud that they count themselves the highest, most learned, most ascetic and most God-fearing among the peoples of the earth. May God destroy them! Blessed is My Name who spoke the truth, and he who spoke before him and after him, and he who was named Ali-Qabli-Akbar in thy Lord’s Book, and he who was named Rida in the Kingdom of Names, and he who returned from prison, and those who were imprisoned in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory shining resplendent from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon them and upon My loved ones in the Hunchbacked [City] and upon those who have acted according to what they were commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>These days news has arrived that some have been released. A letter has arrived from his honor Samandar, upon him be the glory of God, the Lord of Power, wherein it is written that they have requested from the friends a covenant not to gather in meetings. Whatever news has outwardly arrived, from before and after, has been submitted so that His Holiness may be informed. However, the true news and real knowledge is with our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>As regards Ali and his brother Haydar, upon them be the Glory of God and the Rights of God, concerning which you wrote, these matters were submitted and He said: “We magnify Ali and beseech God the Most High to aid him in that which He loves and is pleased with. We remember his brother and counsel him with that which God has revealed in the Book. Blessed is he who holds fast to God’s commandments and trusts in Him in all conditions. Verily you have spoken the truth, and others should follow in your footsteps. Blessed is he who has heard and responded to his Lord, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.”</p>
<p>It is most evident and clear that payment of the Rights of God has been and will always be the cause of bounty, blessing, honor and protection. Blessed is he who has recognized and acknowledged, and woe unto the deniers. This applies when one acts with complete joy and fragrance and desire to fulfill the laws of the Book. It is incumbent upon you to enjoin what is right. Whoso hearkens, it shall be to his own benefit, and whoso turns away, verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the basis for the Rights of God, this servant has previously mentioned it. As for Haydar, since you mentioned him, half of those Rights were bestowed upon him and the other half should be delivered to you, after which its decree will be issued. This too is beloved, provided it occurs with joy and fragrance; otherwise even its mention is not permitted.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all created things and in Whose right hand are the destinies of all existence! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance and the fire of Thy Sacred Tree to cause me in all circumstances to hold fast to Thy cord. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thy most exalted horizon and clinging to the hem of Thy bounty. O Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens! I beseech Thee not to deprive me of the ocean of Thy knowledge nor to disappoint me from the lights of the suns of Thy favors. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance:</p>
<p>O Ali! Beseech God that He may draw thee to such a station wherein the clamor of men and the oppression of those in the land shall not prevent thee from Him. Today the limbs of the world are trembling and the tribes of the earth are quaking and disturbed. The recompense of the unseemly deeds of various peoples hath encompassed them. In every land He appeareth with a different name and manifesteth Himself in a different form. Beseech ye God that He may enable all to achieve that which is pleasing unto Him. Verily He heareth and respondeth, and He is the Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>Let His Honor write and send forth these words that perchance the fragrances of the perfumed garment may be diffused and that fragrance may become the cause of guidance and may draw the heedless people to the ocean of awareness. His Honor Mulla Alijan, upon him be the Glory of the All-Merciful, hath been the cause of the exaltation of the Word in the land of M. Praise be to God that they have been blessed with this great bounty. Repeatedly their mention was heard from the Blessed Tongue and numerous Tablets were sent. God willing, through the light of their sincerity, souls that are firm, steadfast, content and well-pleasing will appear in those regions and will arise to educate the people, so that all may become free and detached from corruption, conflict and bestial traits, and may be adorned with human virtues. The people are unaware and have entertained corrupt imaginings about the Cause of God. If they would truly sanctify themselves from self and passion and turn their attention to the Will of God, exalted be His glory, all would turn in complete humility, submissiveness, resignation and contentment, would cleave unto His Holiness the Well-Known One and would turn away from all else. This evanescent servant beseecheth the True One, the Bestower, the Giver, to answer this supplication. Verily He is the Mighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayers.</p>
<p>Your Honor’s second letter, which was dated the 16th of Jamadi’l-Avval, brought joy to the heart and gladness to the breast. God willing, may the breeze of your pen never cease and may it ever continue to waft and diffuse its fragrance. Regarding what was mentioned about the horse colt and its price, it shall be carried out and implemented exactly as has been arranged and as Your Honor has written. In any case, the matter is referred to Your Honor, and likewise the small remaining sum.</p>
<p>And regarding what you wrote about His Honor Mulla Ahmad A.T., upon him be the Glory of God, it was submitted. This is what the Kingdom of Utterance hath spoken: Verily We make mention of him who was named Ahmad, who turned toward the Wronged One aforetime, and We mention him now with such a mention as is not equaled by aught that pertaineth to the world and its conditions, and We counsel him with that which behooveth man and that whereby the love of God, the Lord of the worlds, may be manifested. O Ahmad! Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. No one should proceed to the Prison except with His permission. Verily He commandeth every seeker according to what is best for him. To this testifieth every discerning one who hath knowledge. Be thou aflame with the fire of the love of thy Lord and occupied with that which profiteth thee and those servants of God who may come unto thee from among the assured ones. In all circumstances be thou mindful of wisdom and say […]</p>
<p>O God of the land and sea and whatsoever is therein! I beseech Thee by the Repository of Thy knowledge, the Wellspring of Thy command, the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, and the Dayspring of Thy clear tokens, to preserve me from all that Thou hast forbidden in Thy Book and to strengthen me in that which Thou hast commanded through Thy decree. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, setting my face toward the horizon of Thy grace, the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from that which Thy Most Exalted Pen hath ordained for Thy loved ones and chosen ones. Verily Thou art He Whom nothing can frustrate and no decree can hinder. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou desirest. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>According to His command, should they return and engage in that which is reckoned as worship, it would be most beloved and still is. How many souls have turned toward the divine Kaaba from distant paths, yet after bearing hardships and difficulties were not counted among the pilgrims in the sight of God; and how many have remained in their homes yet attained the outpouring grace of the True One. The Command is in His hands and He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Generous. This servant conveys greetings to them and seeks divine confirmation for them. In all circumstances they must hold fast to wisdom, for the people have not found the fragrance of utterance and are deprived and forbidden from the ocean of knowledge. They interpret the words of God’s loved ones and chosen ones according to their own desires and engage in dispute and conflict. They have taken as guides those who are unworthy of mention, and have considered the Dawning-Place of God’s names as one who leads astray. By God’s life! Were they to understand, they would lament, but consummate wisdom has been veiled from them and revealed to others. Blessed are they who have attained, and woe unto those who have denied God’s favor, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the leaf, the wife of His Holiness the Exalted One, Aqa Siyyid Abu-?alib, whom the Most Exalted Pen hath mentioned, it was presented, as were his verses and expressions of gratitude, praise and glorification. Blessed is she! Once these sublime words were heard from the Blessed Tongue: The loved ones of Truth must be mindful of the relatives of His Holiness the Exalted One, who was named Abu-?alib, and consider their care obligatory. Verily he hath a station in the Book. O Zayn! Blessed art thou and blessed is he who loveth thee and will love thee and hearkeneth unto thy word. We have found thee grateful, patient, content in hardship and ease, in calamity and tribulation. Thou art he who hath aided thy Lord with thy tongue, thy hand, thy pen and thy sight. He hath adorned thee with the ornament of forgiveness and ordained for thee that which hath made the countenance of creation beam with joy. Were what hath been ordained for thee to be revealed, thou wouldst behold the world in manifest gladness. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. O Zayn! Convey My greetings to My handmaiden whom thou hast mentioned and to those who have believed in the One, the All-Informed. We counsel her and every handmaiden who hath believed in sanctification, detachment, trustworthiness, truthfulness and fidelity. The Command is in God’s hands, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven.</p>
<p>Concerning the mention made of Aqa Muhammad, upon him be the glory of God, from the people of Ham, they had mentioned Jinab-i-Mulla Muhammad and Aqa Mahmud and their degrees of recognition - these matters were presented. Thus surgeth the Most Great Sea. He is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! All servants have sought knowledge and understanding, and pursued the cities of wisdom and utterance. When the blessed and goodly City appeared and the Nightingale of Faithfulness warbled upon the branch of eternity with the Most Exalted Word, all turned away save whom God, the Lord of the worlds, willed. They have regarded the Dayspring of divine unity as one with the people of polytheism, and have mistaken the River of divine wisdom for a mirage. They cling to fancy and idle imaginings, deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of certitude. The fruits of the servants’ deeds have appeared in the form of cannons, rifles and swords, as all have seen and heard. Each day a new affliction appeareth and a fresh severity is witnessed. The wronged community is observed beneath the lashes of the heedless. The earth hath become strait unto them despite its vastness. Beseech ye God to illumine their eyes and grant them attentive ears, that perchance they may return unto the truth and attain the ornament of forgiveness. Until now, they have not known and do not know the cause and reason for this great abasement. We beseech the Exalted One to make them aware and teach them, and aid them to return. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. If thou findest a friend, convey My greetings and salutations and say: Arise and make good what hath escaped thee. Verily, the Wronged One summoneth all unto the Supreme Horizon and counseleth them with that which draweth them nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Zein! Give glad tidings to all who turn unto My turning unto Him, to all who remember My remembrance of Him, and to all who are attracted by My attraction to His countenance. Say: Fear not, neither be ye sorrowful. Answer Him Who calleth you unto goodness, forbiddeth wrong, and counseleth you with that which profiteth you in every world of the worlds of your All-Knowing, All-Wise Lord. Two souls have been mentioned. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm them and grant them the greatest steadfastness. Verily, He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>Your honor must observe great wisdom. The sending of letters to those regions, namely the land of S-L and the City, is not permissible except by chance, for they are exceedingly fanatical and heedless of the essence of knowledge. It seemeth the zeal of the Age of Ignorance hath raised its banner in those lands and established its dominion there. However, since they have attained the presence and been perfumed by the breezes of grace and the fragrance of the Garment, assuredly the effects thereof shall later become manifest and the fruits of the planted trees shall appear. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, hath power over whatsoever He willeth.</p>
<p>As to what was asked concerning the nine stations of the manifest verses, they said that his honor Zein, upon him be My glory, should reflect, and he will attain to the purpose.</p>
<p>And your other letter, dated the 15th of Jumada’th-Thani, through its wondrous breath made fresh and verdant this ailing frame. This servant beseecheth his Lord to recompense your honor with the best of rewards and to ordain for you the good of the hereafter and of this world. This is a prayer which hath in truth already been answered, as your honor and this servant bear witness, and behind us our Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the attention of His Holiness Ism-i-66 [Allah], the Beauty - upon Him be all Glory of Glories - praise be to God, through the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, he arrived safe and sound with his family and children in the Most Great Prison. Later, a special place near the well-known palace was designated specifically for them, and that place is connected to the palace. Now, praise be to God, they reside in the vicinity and are blessed with the honor of attaining His presence. How pleasant, wholesome and blessed this is for him. Upon his first arrival, He inquired about his condition. None but God knows the measure and extent of His favors. The whole world has been and remains incapable of limiting it. All must give thanks to Him throughout the duration of the earthly and heavenly kingdoms.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Aqa Muhammad Kazim, Aqa Muhammad and the son of Jinab-i-’Ali Nur - upon them be the glory of God - it was conveyed, and this is what the Beloved uttered: “We send them greetings and praise, and We beseech God to open before their faces the gates of goodness and blessings, and to send down upon them that which will gladden their hearts and bring tranquility to their souls. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.”</p>
<p>O My Name! The True One, exalted be His glory, has been and is the Trustworthy, the All-Informed. He has known and knows His loved ones, and whatever He deems expedient, He causes to flow and appear. Nothing escapes His knowledge. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the Answering. O Zayn! In this Most Great Revelation, the True One, exalted be His glory, has in every instance seized the oppressors and transgressors. Nevertheless, no one has become aware. Observe what occurred in the great city and the land of ?ad, and likewise in the land of ?a, where He seized with His conquering power the source of evil and its manifestation - namely Siyyid ?adiq - and similarly another soul. Yet all are observed to be heedless and veiled. And He will seize yet another soul. Verily, He has power over all things. In no age has there occurred what has occurred in this Revelation. The abominable and displeasing deeds of the people have prevented them from the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Continuously does the Herald call out and the cry is raised above heads. What cry could be greater than the seizure of the mentioned evil one - namely the liar who was called truthful? Wonder upon wonder! In any case, since mercy has taken precedence, beseech the True One to guide the misguided to the straight path, to awaken the heedless, and not to deprive them from the ocean of His favors.</p>
<p>We make mention at the end of the Tablet of My Most Truthful Name and My Holy Servant who has attained to that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Another matter to submit is regarding the daughter of Jinab-i-Aqa Ghulam-’Ali - upon him be the glory of God. For more than two years he has been seeking permission to bring her, until in this instance permission was granted and he was informed by telegraph. All these matters must, according to the Command, occur in accordance with the Divine Book. Blessed is he who fulfills God’s covenant and acts according to what He has commanded in His Clear Book.</p>
<p>And likewise regarding the daughter of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, upon him be the Glory of God: Last year the mother of Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, came to this servant and requested that something be written. Since no word indicating this matter had been heard from the Most Holy Presence, it was therefore delayed until this time when it was honored with the adorning of permission and they sent word to Tel, and this matter was accepted in His presence. And she has also taken a place near the mansion which is good for both parties in every way. We beseech God to unite them and draw them near to Him. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>The people of the Name of God “Jamal” have, in service to the Haram, conveyed a word from the wife of Jinab-i-Shatir Husayn regarding his daughter, and that word was presented before His presence. According to His command: if she wishes to proceed to the Most Holy Court in accompaniment with the daughter of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Sadiq, there is no objection. All these matters must, according to His command, be carried out with spirit and fragrance and means and contentment. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Oft-Returning, the All-Forgiving, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>And likewise according to His command, they should write with wisdom and utterance to certain quarters regarding the Huquq, that which is the cause of confirmation of the servants, that perchance they may be enabled to act according to what the All-Bestowing One hath revealed in the Book. And of whatever is received, half should be given to the friends of God in that land. And previously it was commanded that funds be sent to that quarter. It is strange that until now they have not arrived. The servant beseecheth his Lord to send down upon the beloved ones of the All-Merciful and its captives that which will make them wealthy in His lands and chosen ones among His creation. Verily our Lord is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Another submission: Previously according to His command it was written regarding the Book that one volume should be sent to Jinab-i-Aqa Shahvirdi, upon him be the Glory of God. Until now news of its receipt has not arrived. And likewise Jinab-i-Haji Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God, has given ten tumans so that His Holiness might write and send some of the wondrous verses specifically for him. If a copy of the book which the beloved Jinab-i-Nazim, upon him be the Glory of God, was carrying could be written and sent specifically for him, it would be most beloved. God willing it will arrive soon, as Jinab-i-Shahvirdi has repeatedly expressed this. Although this evanescent one knows that His Holiness is occupied and has not had and does not have opportunity beyond what he has already done, nevertheless God willing they will give priority to this matter and complete it.</p>
<p>This evanescent one’s submission is that greetings, peace and congratulations are offered to all the gentlemen and friends, and he begs from the Truth that He may illumine all with the light of unity and concord. The Glory shining and effulgent from the horizon of the heaven of the providence of our Lord and our Desire be upon your honor and upon those with you and upon those who love you and recognize your station and hear your words and upon those who act according to what they have been commanded by God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. And praise be to God, the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p>On the 28th of the month of Rajab 1300</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>The Branches of the Blessed Tree - may my spirit and being be sacrificed for the dust of their footsteps - expressed special bounties toward your honor and conveyed such greetings as are sanctified above this evanescent one’s mention and writing.</p>
<p>=== END BH00129 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00130 ===</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us to him who, when he heard the Call from the direction of his Most Glorious Lord, said: “Yea, O God of all who are in earth and heaven!” - that the verses of his Lord might once again attract him and draw him nigh unto a station wherein he heareth the call of all things in the remembrance of God, the Creator of Names, and wherein he announceth unto the peoples the mention of his Lord, the Ancient of Days, both in private and in public.</p>
<p>Remind the servants of the remembrance of thy Lord, the Lord of the Return. Say: O people! The Day hath come, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the Compeller. This is not a day for sitting still. Arise with such arising as shall cause all created things to arise. Thus behooveth it him who hath turned his face toward the Horizon of all horizons. Many a standing one is accounted as sitting in thy Lord’s sight, and many a living one is reckoned among the dead. Verily, he who hath drunk the choice wine of life from the hands of the gracious favor of his Lord, the All-Merciful - he, verily, is standing, by thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. This is an arising after which there is no sitting, if one be steadfast in the Cause of God, the Lord of all men. By My life! Sleep shall not overtake him even should he sleep, yet the people are wrapt in veils and barriers. When he lieth down, the tongue of his secret heart declareth: “The All-Bestowing hath come in the shadows of the clouds,” and when he riseth up he pointeth with the finger of certitude toward the direction of the Worshipped One, saying: “This is the Dawning-Place of the signs of your Lord, the Mighty, the Effulgent.”</p>
<p>How many a speaker is silent, and how many a silent one speaketh with truth. Thus doth the All-Merciful testify, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Whoso speaketh this Most Great Remembrance is the true speaker among the peoples, and he who denieth it is but a barking dog, even should he be the most eloquent of the eloquent. Thus hath the matter been decreed by thy Lord, the Lord of all names and attributes.</p>
<p>Beware lest tribulation prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven. Follow thy Lord in all matters - thus hast thou been commanded in the Scriptures and Tablets. Verily, when He was imprisoned, He desired to convey unto the kings the messages of His Lord, that all might know that tribulation hath not prevented the Most Great Name when He came from the heaven of Command with power and sovereignty. We have sent down for each one a Tablet that shineth between the heavens and the earth. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and hath read it and hath said: “Power belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Compelling!”</p>
<p>Seek thou the help of God in all conditions. The monotheists shall soon behold the standards of the Manifestation in all regions.</p>
<p>Blessed art thou, O Our Most Truthful Name, inasmuch as thou hast remained faithful to God’s Covenant and His Testament on a Day whereon faces were illumined by the light of thy Lord’s countenance and the eyes of them that turned unto God with humility and contrition were solaced. Subdue the cities of hearts through this Most Great Remembrance and be thou a herald amongst the peoples of this Name whereby all tribes were seized with trembling and the Rock cried out with loudest voice: “The Chosen One hath come with dominion and power!” By My life! Should anyone turn with his heart toward the Qiblih of existence, he would surely inhale the fragrance of sanctity from this Garment through which the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over all regions. How many a learned one hath been veiled this Day, and how many an ignorant one hath hastened to enter the Kingdom of his Lord, the Most Exalted! How many a wise one hath been held back by vain imaginings, and how many a child hath shattered the idols through the power of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! Blessed is he whom the breathings of the verses have so transported that he hath rent asunder the veils, and stood up proclaiming: “O people! The Self-Subsisting hath come! Behold, O ye who are endued with insight!” Blessed art thou for having been mentioned at all times by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, Who hath sent down unto thee each year that which hath gladdened the eyes and caused spirits to soar. God hath heard what thou didst ask and desire. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He ordaineth what He willeth for whomsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Put thy trust in Him in all affairs. It behooveth thee to desire what God hath desired, for thou art the First Name in the Book. We have ordained for thee and thy progeny that which shall perpetuate your remembrance throughout creation. We have destined for thee that which thou canst not comprehend today. By My life! Wert thou to know it, thou wouldst fall upon the dust and exclaim: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Whose bounty hath encompassed all created things!” And such rapture would seize thee as to deprive thee of the reins of self-control, by My Self, the All-Compelling over all contingent things! Be thou steadfast in such wise that shouldst the polytheists assail thee with the swords of hatred, thou wouldst cry out amongst them with radiant face and crimson countenance: “Fear ye this Day! He Who brought all things into being hath appeared with His Most Great Name!” Whereupon He calleth out from the direction of the Prison, summoning all unto God, the Sovereign Lord of the winds.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath turned to God, the Lord of Names, that he may read the verses of his Lord and be numbered with them that have attained. Make mention of him who hath been named ’Ali-A?ghar, who hath turned towards the Most Great Scene on the day when the Lord of Destiny came with manifest sovereignty. We had sent down unto thee aforetime a Tablet whereby the hearts of them that are possessed with love took flight, and now once again as a token of grace from the presence of the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Glorified be He Who speaketh at all times amidst the concourse of creation, and calleth them unto His straight Path. They that have turned aside, these have no station save that they are accounted among the heedless. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful. Follow Him before Whom the verses have prostrated themselves and to Whom the necks of the proud have been humbled. Beware lest ye claim that which hath not been ordained for you by your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By His very truth, the matter hath been decided and that which ye were promised in God’s Scriptures, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds, hath appeared. He hath indeed come with the truth, and the eye of the world hath been solaced thereby. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him with a luminous heart. Spread not corruption in the earth - We have adorned it with justice through this grace which hath shone forth from the horizon of your Lord’s tender mercy, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be ye helpers of God’s Cause. Beware lest ye transgress the bounds set forth in God’s Book. Thus have We commanded Our servants in a Tablet sealed with the seal of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We have chosen tribulations for the betterment of the world and the unity of all therein. Beware lest ye speak that whereby discord may arise. Thus doth your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, counsel you. Adorn yourselves with the raiment of servitude unto God, the True One, that the regions may be illumined by the lights which have shone forth from the horizon of this heaven which hath been raised up through this Most Great Name. Through servitude is the station of creation made manifest, through it do faces turn unto the Dayspring of the verses of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. How many servants there were who, when they saw the Cause exalted, laid claim to that which caused to perish what their Ancient Lord had desired. When the breezes of trial blew, they were overturned, and when the zephyrs of tranquility passed by, they opposed God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Thus have We recounted unto thee that thou mayest remember those who carve out idols each day and worship them - these are indeed in manifest error. Arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord through remembrance and utterance. Thus hath the All-Merciful commanded in His Tablets. He, verily, ruleth over whatsoever He willeth. Let not the oppression of them that have oppressed grieve thee, nor let the might of the idolaters hold thee back. God will soon seize them through His power even as He seized the factions of old. Verily thy Lord is severe in punishment, and sovereignty shall endure unto His Self, the One Who overshadoweth the worlds.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is the Day of attentive hearing. Hearken unto the Call from the crimson Tree upon the luminous Spot. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Single, the Unique, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Cast away all created things behind you, then turn with your hearts unto the Dawning-place of inspiration. This is better for you than all that hath been created in the heavens and earths. Say: It behoveth no one to test God in this Revelation; rather doth God test whomsoever He willeth. Fear God and follow not every doubting idolater. Choose ye what God hath chosen through His grace, and anchor not your faith to your idle fancies, but rather to that which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of grace. Thus have ye been commanded in the Bayan from the All-Merciful, if ye be of them that know. Say: Sufficeth it not what hath been manifested in this Revelation? By God! Power hath encompassed all, sovereignty hath appeared, the signs have shone forth and the evidences have dawned. Blessed is he who hath turned unto God and hath been stirred by the breeze of God in this radiant and resplendent Day. Among the people are those who desire from God that which hath not been ordained for them, and when they behold it they turn away and become abased. And among them are those who have attained the presence of God and upon whom the All-Merciful hath shed the lights of His Beauty; these have bowed down in prostration, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds!” And among the people are those who, when they hear the Call from the quarter of destiny, turn unto God, the Lord of all names. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee as a favor from Us. Be thou grateful and among those who remember. Know thou that when We desired to proclaim the Message, We created the wondrous one through a word from Us, then breathed into him a spirit from Our presence. When his creation was complete, he hastened like a mountain of fire with the Book of thy Lord, the Chosen One, unto the place which was ordained in a guarded tablet. Therein did We manifest power in such wise as to shake the pillars of the workers of iniquity, and We sent down therein from every condition that which causeth the hearts of the knowing ones to soar. If thou hast attained unto it, read and ponder that which hath been revealed therein, that thou mayest discover the power of thy Lord, Who was imprisoned in the most desolate of cities and Who sat beneath the swords of the oppressors. When thou readest, say: “Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I testify that Thy Will hath encompassed all created things and Thy power hath prevailed over all things possible. The might of those who have turned away from Thee shall not dismay Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy sovereignty and ordainest what Thou desirest through Thy word. None hath any refuge save with Thee, nor any haven except beneath the shadow of Thy mercy. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.” O Most Exalted Pen! Set forth the verses once again that the people of creation may be attracted thereby. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Then give unto the steadfast one to drink of the wine of verses that it may draw him to the kingdom of names and attributes and bring him nigh unto a station wherein he seeth naught save God, the Mighty, the Loving. If thou detachest thyself in My love from all else besides Me, thou shalt behold My dominion and My power. Thus hast thou been commanded from before God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Beware lest the affairs of men grieve thee and bar thee from the Most Sublime Vision. Leave what they possess and put thy trust in God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. If the wine of mystic knowledge hath intoxicated thee, arise in My name, the All-Merciful, amidst all possibilities, then summon the people with wisdom and utterance to a praiseworthy station. Say: O people! Fear ye God. The Day hath come and that which was mentioned in the Tablets hath appeared. Beware lest ye follow every rejected idolater. All things cry out between earth and heaven: “The veils have been rent asunder and the Promised One hath come!” Beware lest passion hold you back from guidance. Cast aside the imaginary; the Known One hath come with evident sovereignty.</p>
<p>O My loved ones! Be ye united in the Cause of God, in such wise that no winds of discord may pass between you. This is that whereunto ye were bidden in the Tablets. This is better for you, did ye but know. Arise to aid the Cause of God in such wise that all the hosts of the earth shall not affright you. Thus hath the decree been recorded in the Preserved Tablet. How many a steadfast one was prevented from turning to Him, and how many a seated one hastened to attain. Blessed are they who understand. How many a seeing one was veiled by the veils, and how many a blind one saw and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou God of the seen and unseen!” Verily, they who have turned unto Him, the denizens of Paradise pray for them. They shall soon find themselves in the most exalted station. Thy Lord is, verily, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen.</p>
<p>Say: O people! He is the Most Great Sign amongst you, and the Beauty of God, the Most Exalted, the Most High, in your midst, would ye but perceive it. He is God’s power over them that turned away, and the breath of the All-Merciful to them that are turned unto Him. Say: Whither do ye flee? Think ye that ye have a place of refuge? Nay, by His most luminous Beauty, could ye but understand. Say: Nothing shall, on this Day, profit you, though ye should take hold of all that is in the heavens and on earth, except that ye turn unto the Dayspring of Grace through this Name that hath dominion over all that witness and are witnessed. Blessed is the slumberer who hath been awakened by the call of God, and the heedless one who hath turned to His countenance. Woe unto every learned one who is veiled.</p>
<p>O Ancient Pen! Remind the peoples and him who hath attained unto this Light that shineth forth from the horizon of the Will of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. O Mahdi! Hearken unto the call from the direction of grandeur, from this divine Lote-Tree raised upon the luminous spot in the name of thy most glorious Lord. Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Follow God’s commandment in what hath been revealed in the Book, then turn with thy heart unto His countenance, turning away from every polytheist and doubter.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Rejoice in these days wherein the All-Merciful hath come in the shadows of proof, and the Sun of the countenance hath shone forth without cloud or veil. Blessed is he who hath soared in the atmosphere of the mercy of the All-Merciful, and the heart that hath turned unto Him in humility and repentance. Detach thyself from what thy passion desireth and hold fast unto the Most Firm Handle. This is better for thee than the kingdom of the heavens and earth, though none comprehend this save them who are endowed with understanding. Thus have We caused the wine of inner meanings and utterance to flow in the rivers of wisdom and explanation. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Beware lest the veils prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Remember thy Lord with this Most Great Remembrance with fire and attraction. Verily, they who are heedless this Day have denied God, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of divines! Cast aside the pen of vain desire. By God! The Most Exalted Pen hath moved by the leave of your Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious. Then hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur and Majesty proclaimeth between earth and heaven. Then cast aside all learning, for the All-Knowing hath come with His name, the Self-Subsisting, with power and sovereignty. Will what ye possess profit you? Nay, by the Opener of doors! Where are they who were before you? Ponder, O ye who are endued with sight! Blessed is the learned one who hath rent the greatest veil, turning unto the Most Pure Prospect. He is among the most exalted of creatures before the Truth, the Most High. Soon shall the world and that wherein ye pride yourselves perish, and sovereignty and might shall endure for those who have turned unto this Countenance before which all necks have bowed. Blessed is the seeing one whom the veils have not prevented, and the discerning one who hath shattered the idol of fancy in the name of his Lord, the Mighty, the All-Compelling. Say: O people of the earth! Die in your wrath! Soon shall the standards of the Cause be raised in every city, and the regions shall be illumined thereby. Thus have We imparted unto thee that which shall attract the hearts, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord at morn and eventide.</p>
<p>O Most Great Pen! Move in remembrance of Husayn, that the mention of the Ancient King may draw him to this noble prospect. Hearken to the call of the Wronged One from the direction of His Name, the Self-Subsisting. I am indeed the Lonely Stranger.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Husayn hath wept at My separation and lamented at the tribulations that have befallen Me in the path of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Give thanks unto God for having attained unto these days wherein the Sun of Beauty hath shone forth from the horizon of glory in such wise that neither the clouds of the wayward nor the veils of majesty could obscure it. Blessed are they that have attained! Blessed is the one who hath seized the Book with the power of his Lord, the Master of all necks, and hath cast aside those who denied God, the One, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>It behoveth every soul to strive in the Cause of his Lord, not according to his own desires. Thus hath the decree been ordained for the people of Baha in a Tablet sealed with the finger of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Beware lest sorrows prevent thee from the remembrance of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. Be thou mindful of My Name amidst all who dwell within the realm of possibility. Say: O people! The All-Glorious hath come in the shadows of the clouds, and sovereignty belongeth unto God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst see one who turneth away, say: Woe unto thee, O thou who associateth partners with God! Soon shalt thou find thyself in manifest loss. Is doubt befitting after clear proofs have come? Nay, by the Revealer of verses, if thou be of them that know! Every proof hath prostrated itself before My proof, and every evidence circleth round the Most Merciful. Blessed are they that perceive! The rock hath been moved by the cry of thy Lord, and all atoms in earth and heaven call out through this Most Great Name, yet the people lie sleeping behind the veils of their own selves.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who hath turned, drawn nigh, heard and said: “Praise be unto Thee for having manifested Thy beauty, O Thou Who art the Beloved of all in the heavens and the earth!” Aid Me, O My loved ones, through such deeds as will cause the sweet fragrance of holiness to waft among all worlds. Then subdue all who are on earth through My Name and My sovereignty. This behoveth him who hath laid hold on this holy and luminous hem.</p>
<p>If thou findest one possessed of insight, spread the Tablet before him that his eyes may be gladdened and he may be of them that have attained. By My life! He who hath drunk the love of the calf is assuredly among the perished, except he arise through this Name and become one who proclaimeth this wise Remembrance among the servants. Say: This is He through Whose Name the Tablets have been adorned and for Whose remembrance the Bayan was revealed, if ye be of them that know.</p>
<p>Beware lest ye commit that which would cause the Spirit of Baha to lament in the Most Exalted Paradise and the eyes of them that are nigh to weep. Cast behind you all allusions, then turn with radiant faces toward the Qiblih of all existence. This is better for you than all ye possess, would ye but understand. Your belief profiteth Us not, nor doth your denial harm Us. To this testifieth all things, and beyond them the tongue of God, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>From the horizon of tribulation, We summon all unto God. Whoso hath turned unto Him hath attained, and whoso hath denied is assuredly among the wrongdoers. Thus have We caused to shower upon thee from the ocean of grace. When thou hast attained unto it, say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of them that know!</p>
<p>O Pen of Revelation! Make mention of the Dyer. Say: The Day of divine coloring hath come. Blessed is he who hath been colored with the coloring of God through his detachment from all else. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen decreed from the presence of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. Color the servants with the name of the Lord of creation. Thus art thou commanded from the presence of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not the ascetics who have clung to the cord of names, invoking them morning and evening; yet when their Creator appeared in the shadows of light, they disbelieved, even to the point where they pronounced against Him a manifest injustice. Thereby hath the word of punishment become due unto them. Soon shall they return to their abode - evil indeed is the abode of the idolaters. How many a veiled one hath believed in the Lord of Creation, and how many a turbaned one hath disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment! How many an ignorant one hath drunk from the Kawthar of knowledge from the hands of grace, and how many a learned one hath remained lost in the wilderness of error! Thus hath the recompense of every soul been ordained. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Say: O people! This is your Lord, the All-Merciful, Who hath come with clear proof and evidence. Turn ye unto Him and follow not every sinful rejecter. This is the Day wherein the faces of those who turned away from the Countenance have been darkened, while the faces of those who turned towards Him have been illumined. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and oppose not Him through Whom the lights of divine knowledge have shone forth in the kingdom of possibility, and through Whose Name the Spirit of Truth hath cried out among the idolaters. Among them is one who hath said that He denieth the Unseen. Say: Be silent, O thou who associateth partners with God! The Unseen speaketh with this most wondrous, most glorious Tongue. The atoms testify that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who speaketh is the Manifestation of His Essence, the Dawning-Place of His signs, the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Source of His Command amongst the worlds. And among them is one who hath said: “Will the All-Merciful appear before the creation of the Bayan is completed?” Say: Through My appearance all things are completed. By My life, were it not for My appearance, its creation would not have been perfected, even were it to endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven. Fear God and follow not the imaginings of them that deny.</p>
<p>Say: I am the cloud of bounty for what was sown in the Bayan, and We were unto it as the breezes of spring. Through My appearance the heaven of the Bayan was raised up and adorned with brilliant stars and manifest words. To this testifieth all existence, both seen and unseen, save those on whose faces appeareth the soot of hellfire. Blessed be the face that hath been illumined by this light, and the heart that hath been drawn to the signs of its Lord, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Hearts have been created for My knowledge, tongues for My praise, and eyes for My beauty. Verily, it hath shone forth from the horizon of the prison in such wise that the veils of the hearts of the oppressors have not withheld it. Blessed art thou, for the Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee from the presence of thy Lord, the Most Glorious. By My life, this is indeed a great bounty.</p>
<p>O Most Great Pen! Make mention of Thy servant Husayn, who hath believed in the Lord of all nations, that he may turn with his heart unto the Most Great Vista. O Husayn! We have sent down unto thee numerous tablets, and here is yet another, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the Possessor of Destiny. Say: O concourse of men! In what direction do ye flee? Today ye have no place of refuge save through casting aside what ye possess and clinging to the cord of God, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous. He is verily the Most Great Sign among you, and His proof unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. He is indeed the Hidden Mystery through whom God tormenteth such as have disbelieved and denied. His punishment is indeed most grievous and bitter. Say: Unto whom do ye hasten, O people of error? Hasten unto Him with your hearts. With Me is the ultimate abode. The lights of the Countenance have shone forth from the horizon of the Cause. Blessed is he who hath beheld, and woe unto him who hath frowned and scowled. Say: He is the One concerning Whom God took His covenant in the atoms of the Bayan, before His Own covenant. This is attested by that which hath been sent down in the tablets and scriptures. Say: This is the Day whereon the All-Merciful hath been manifested unto all creation. Blessed are they who are endowed with vision. He hath appeared in such wise that neither the opposition of the opposer nor the veils of them that have transgressed against God and disbelieved can hinder Him. By My life! Whoso findeth the sweetness of the remembrance of his Lord, the All-Merciful, will soar on the wings of certitude above all creation. To this testifieth every person of knowledge and thought. Drink ye the pure water of wisdom and utterance from that which hath flowed from this Pen through which the decree of destiny hath been established. When We sent down the verses, they said: “These are but impostures.” And when We manifested that at which minds and spirits were bewildered, they said: “This is but continuous sorcery.” Let not the allusions of the people grieve thee. Leave them behind thee. Soon shall the breezes of chastisement pass over them, and the unitarians shall behold them as uprooted palm-trunks. Where are the palaces of them who disbelieved in God? We have returned them to their graves. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. When the Countenance shone forth from the horizon of grace, the sun was eclipsed and the moon was cleft asunder. They who have turned away from God are in torment and flame, while they who have turned unto Him are blessed by the denizens of the highest paradise, and their names are recorded in an imperishable tablet. Blessed is the pen that hath moved in My remembrance and through which My Cause hath been established. Woe unto him who hath denied the Cause of God when it was exalted and made manifest.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Turn toward Thy servant ’Ali-Rida, then adorn him with Thy mighty and glorious remembrance, that he may soar on the wings of longing in this atmosphere which God hath sanctified from the imaginings of the idolaters. Follow thou the religion of God and His ways. This is what thou hast been commanded in a clear tablet. We perceive from thee the fragrance of love by reason of Our having manifested thee from the land wherein We raised up the Beloved of the worlds. Be thou thankful to God for this bounty and recognize the station of this mighty station. Beware lest anything hold thee back from God. Glorify thy Lord with praise amongst His heedless servants. Make mention of Him in such wise as to awaken them that slumber. This behooveth one who hath turned toward the Qiblih of the knowers. How many a worshipper hath worshipped God throughout the nights and days, yet when the Truth came denied his Lord, the Mighty, the Wise. How many are the servants who circle the lands and visit the places wherein are buried the Manifestations of My names, yet when the Dayspring and Sovereign of the names appeared, they disbelieved and turned away. They are indeed among the losers. Blessed is the detached one who hath immersed himself in this Most Great Ocean which surgeth through this Name which God hath made the Sovereign of Names for all who are in the heavens and on earth. Be thou thankful unto thy Lord for having turned toward thee the face of the favor of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest read them and be of the thankful ones.</p>
<p>Then remember Nabil-i-Qabli-’Ali, who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the Peerless, that the breezes of revelation may draw him and detach him from the world and all that is therein, turning him toward the Kingdom of his Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious. Sell all things save My love, for by God the treasures of all who are on earth and the riches of all worlds cannot equal it. Guard thou the pearl of the love of the All-Merciful within thy heart through this Name, the Mighty, the Impregnable. Then conceal it from those who have betrayed God’s Cause. Thus doth this Wronged One, this Exile, command thee. Adorn thy face with turning unto God, thy heart with devotion, and thy tongue with the praise of thy Lord, the Beauteous. Grieve not over those from whom thou perceivest the stench of aversion. Leave them to their vain imaginings and idle play. They walk while God’s wrath pursueth them. Thus hath judgment been decreed in a preserved Tablet. Make mention of thy Lord in such wise as to attract all created things. This beseemeth one who hath turned unto God with a pure and luminous heart. Blessed is he who seeth and knoweth, who heareth and hearkeneth, and whose tongue uttereth this wise remembrance. Blessed is the heedless one who turneth with his heart to the Qiblih of the horizons. Woe unto the wise one who is debarred from this bounty that hath encompassed all creation. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord in such wise that neither the veils of idle fancies nor the clamor of the oppressors shall hold thee back. Trust in God under all conditions, and when thou attainest unto the Tablet say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of the hearts of the sincere!”</p>
<p>O Most Holy Pen! Make mention of Ta before Qaf and Ya, that he may rejoice in being remembered by the Most Exalted Pen and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose light the earth and heavens were illumined!” Hearken unto the call from the shore of love in the luminous spot from the Tree of the heart - verily there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Rejoice in that thou hast been remembered by the Pen of Command through which the winds were subdued. Grieve not over anything. Trust in all matters in thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. He hath ordained for His loved ones that which the pens are powerless to record.</p>
<p>O loved ones of the All-Merciful! Be steadfast in the Cause in such wise that neither the might of kings nor the wrath of subjects shall deter you. This beseemeth all who have turned unto the Face, detached from all directions. Convey unto the servants what ye have learned of your Lord’s command. Thus have We counseled you in the Scriptures and Tablets. In teaching, hold fast unto the cord of wisdom and utterance. Thus doth the Lord of Religions instruct you. Do ye see any permanence in what ye behold? Nay, by My Name, the Ruler over all lands! Adopt ye My characteristics that through them the sweet fragrances of holiness may be wafted to all regions. Grieve not over what hath befallen thee of tribulation. We were with thee when thou wert in the hands of the oppressors. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. With Him is the knowledge of all things in the Book. We have ordained for thee, in return for what thou hast borne in His path, that which shall solace all eyes. Thus have We cast upon thee of thy Lord’s verses that thou mayest thank Him at eventide and dawn.</p>
<p>O Pen of Power! Make mention of Thy chosen servants whose names were not recorded in the Tablet, that they may render thanks unto God, their Lord, by night and by day. O My loved ones in that land! By My life, ye are beneath the gaze of your Lord, and the tongue of grandeur moveth to make mention of you. O concourse of companions! Ye are they who turned towards the Countenance on a Day when eyes were dazed, and who recognized your Lord while mankind remained heedless and veiled. Soon shall all who dwell on earth glory in your names and lament what was visited upon you by those who disbelieved in God, the Cleaver of the dawn. Grieve not at anything, but put your trust in Him in all matters. Verily, He is with those of His servants who have remained faithful to the Covenant. And the glory of God rest upon you, O loved ones of God, from your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bestowing. Though your names were not recorded in the Tablet, We have mentioned them in a Tablet which God hath made the Mother of Tablets. Rejoice ye that mention was made of you before the Throne when the Lord of the Throne was in the hands of the wicked ones.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Thou knowest that from this Prison I call Thy loved ones to the shore of Thy bounties, purely for Thy sake, and at a time when the idolaters have encompassed me from every side, I make mention of Thee, O Lord of Names and Attributes! I beseech Thee to assist Thy servants to champion Thy Cause and exalt Thy Word, and to aid them in that which will manifest the sanctity of Thy Being amidst Thy creation and the detachment of Thy commandments amongst Thy creatures. O Lord! Illumine the eyes of their hearts with the light of Thy knowledge, and adorn their temples with the ornament of Thy most excellent names in the kingdom of creation. Thou art, verily, powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>=== END BH00130 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00131 ===</p>
<p>O beloved and revered one, His Holiness ’Ali-Before-Akbar, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God and the Most Exalted Luminous Light of God, take note:</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Praise and thanksgiving belong, in the first degree, to His Beauty and, in the second degree, to His chosen ones who, in such an age when the world of limitations and restrictions has reached its end, have arisen with perfect steadfastness to open the gate of a temperate, acceptable, and balanced freedom of expression. The insinuations of the opposers and the doubts of the transgressors did not prevent them from the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Despite being surrounded by enemies from all directions, the oppression of tyrants, and the waves of armies of wickedness and vice, they were not deprived of hearing the Call raised from the Most Exalted Horizon. Exalted be His Glory, universal His bounty, and mighty His dominion! Verily the servant speaks and presents:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Open the gates of hearts with the keys of Thy most beautiful Names and illumine them with the lights of Thy utterance in Thy Days. Aid them to return unto Thee and to acknowledge what Thou hast revealed in Thy Books, Thy Scriptures, Thy Scrolls, and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest what hath appeared from the calumniators and the heedless ones who have made treachery a crown for their heads and falsehood an ornament for their temples. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, by Thy greatest signs and Thy traces in the kingdom of creation, to send down from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will transform darkness into light and falsehood into truth. Verily, Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned in my heart and upon my tongue! Multiple letters from that beloved of the heart have arrived, their fragrance testifying to love, affection, detachment, and steadfastness. Whenever each arrived in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, it attained the honor of being presented and heard, but due to the multitude of pressing matters, there was delay in response. In truth, the decree of delay in this station is not permissible in any station, for the All-Knowing Lord of the Unseen and that beloved one bear witness to the sincerity of love and purity of that honored one, and likewise to the annihilation of the will of these servants in the Will of God. Moreover, the traces that have come to that honored one are more than can be counted, and surely you will say that new and fresh expressions have another splendor in the heart, and this word is truth, there is no doubt in it. It is hoped that henceforth, through the favors of the Goal of the worlds, there shall appear from this servant that which will renew the remembrance of the chosen ones and increase the joy and delight of true friends. Glorified is He Who has subjected the wills of the servants to His Will and their wishes to His Wish, and He is the Commander, the Ruler, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>And after turning and becoming aware, intending the station of grandeur, after presenting before the Throne of Grace, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these verses, Mighty be His utterance and Glorious His proof:</p>
<p>I am the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>All things bear witness to My rising, My remembrance, My praise, My steadfastness, My care, My grace, and My mercy. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained. He is, before God, the Lord of the worlds, among the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Say: O people! This is not the day of your questioning, your mention, your speech, and your call. It behooveth you to turn with your ears to the Most Exalted Horizon that ye may hear what hath been raised therein. By the life of God! What ye possess will not profit you. Cast it away by a power from Us and a strength from Our presence, and take with hands of submission the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Ali-Akbar! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. Verily most of the people have not recognized this Day and its station. They utter that which the ignorant of the earth uttered before. Thus have their souls enticed them. They are indeed among the losers, the wrongdoers, the transgressors, and the heedless. They have not perceived the fragrance of the Day of God, nor have they recognized what hath been revealed therein. We bear witness that they are but worthless creatures in the sight of God, the Mighty, the Praised. They have cast the Truth behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies.</p>
<p>The ears say: O my God, my Lord and my Support! I beseech Thee by the Power that hath encompassed all created things to protect me from the roaring of Thine enemies and from hearkening to that which proceedeth from the mouths of the ignorant among Thy creatures. My Lord! I testify that Thou didst create me to hearken unto Thy most sweet call and the scratching of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee to assist me to manifest that for which Thou hast created me. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The immature ones of the world have said that which caused the ears to lodge their complaint before Him. His honor knoweth that the Truth, exalted be His glory, hath revealed in the Kingdom of grace that which is the cause of the exaltation of the peoples of the world. Every person of understanding and fairness beareth witness to that which hath appeared from the treasury of the Most Exalted Pen. In truth, the Luminary of utterance hath so manifested itself that no excuse remaineth for the peoples of the world. Consider the idle words of Hadi, the son of Mirza Yahya. By the Sun of Truth! No heedless one in this age hath uttered such words. It is not known what he hath understood of the Truth and what he comprehendeth of usurpation. From all his utterances, conduct and deeds, the station and condition of that party hath become evident and clear. Say: Thou wert not with thy father, thou didst not see thy father, and thou art not aware of the Cause of God. Fear God and be not of the calumniators.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned that “they have usurped my father’s right” - these are the same meaningless utterances of the past spoken for the sake of leadership, and such words and their like have caused the stations and ranks of the chosen ones and successors to be lost. The Prince of Martyrs, exalted be his deed, said: “O my brother, what manner of compromise was this that thou didst make?” He replied that it was due to lack of trust in the friends. He asked: “Why didst thou make the acceptance of money the main pillar of the compromise?” Most of the companions objected and reviled and rejected that holy being. In truth, a reprehensible matter appeared, for the basis of the compromise was set as the customs revenues of Kufa and Jahrum of Fars. The Lord of Lovers was greatly saddened by this incident. But poor Hadi knew not what to say. He and others cling to fabricated claims of persecution that they might thereby cast hatred into the hearts of the servants. Whenever anyone goes to Cyprus they say that the night before or the day before people came from Akka to kill so-and-so. Had they found the people to be fair-minded, they would never have uttered such words, for all know that for years he dwelt in complete comfort under protection. By the life of God! Not a single blow struck him, but the disease of prejudice is severe. We beseech God to grant healing that all may speak with justice and fairness and reflect upon what hath occurred. During this time not a drop of his blood or that of his associates was shed in God’s path. The lands themselves bear witness to this. But the people were and are worshippers of vain imaginings.</p>
<p>O Ali-Qabli-Akbar! With the dawning rays of the Sun of Divine favor, exalted be His glory, they intended the martyrdom of the Desire of the worlds, and when that which was hidden in their breasts was revealed, they spoke that which thou hast heard. After this incident, this Wronged One left his wives and children safe and sound, and departed. To this beareth witness every truthful and trustworthy one, and every fair-minded and well-informed person. Say: O Hadi! Thy father was not a man of wisdom. Throughout his life he occupied himself with pastimes and diversions. Were it not for the attention and favor of this Wronged One, neither thou, nor thy father, nor the Cause of God would have existed. Be fair: neither thou, nor thy sister, nor Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani, nor Mirza Hadi-i-Dawlat-Abadi were ever with Us, nor were ye aware of the essence of the Cause. For the sake of God, ponder upon the divine verses, or present thyself that perchance the breezes of revelation may make thee aware and grant thee that for which thou wert brought from nothingness into being.</p>
<p>O Hadi! Go to the prison of the government and ask the deputy to show thee the chain known as Salasil, and likewise the last chain known as Qarahguhar, that thou mayest become aware of the tribulations and afflictions of the Wronged One. For four months did the Wronged One bear the weight of these chains, as well as other afflictions which most of the people of that region have heard of and know about. O Hadi! An unseemly word hath proceeded from thee. We did not usurp thy father’s rights; rather, We have been and are his protector, helper and benefactor. This statement is, first of all, very old and meaningless, and the station of the Letters of the Living hath, in the eyes of those possessed of keen sight and attentive ears, been degraded by such words. For if their right was to earthly clay and water, that is of no account to those who are detached, who have passed beyond this mortal world of dust and have set their faces toward the immortal divine Kingdom. And if the right mentioned refers to divine bounties and the mysteries of sacred Books, no one hath power to lay claim to these. Had We been present in that time, We would certainly have forbidden them from uttering such unseemly words. O Hadi! Leave aside these mentions and reflect upon the penetrating power of the Supreme Pen and the authority of the Most Exalted Word, which, without armies and hosts, hath achieved the Most Great Victory. Such a victory hath never been witnessed by the people of impregnable fortresses and mighty strongholds from the beginning of the world until now. Those who have uttered such words did so at a time when some of the lands, villages and cities of the world were under Islamic rule, whereas now this people do not possess even a hand’s breadth of earth that could be subject to seizure or usurpation.</p>
<p>O Hadi! Whither has thy perception fled? It beseemeth not man to utter vain imaginings. We have borne all the afflictions of the earth for the exaltation of God’s Cause. When the world of darkness was somewhat illumined by the dawning light of the Day Star of divine guidance, thou and thy father and others emerged from behind the veil with the swords of hatred. Instead of being grateful, thou dost complain. Were the events of the past to flow from the Most Exalted Pen and be made manifest, the very mountain of thy being would be crushed. He Who possesseth the Mother Book beareth witness unto this. Furthermore, this Wronged One hath never claimed vicegerency, deputyship, guardianship, succession, leadership, nobility or to be the fourth pillar. The Primal Point testified to this station in His words: “He verily speaketh in every condition, saying: ‘Verily, I am God,’” and so forth as revealed through the tongue of revelation. O Hadi! Thy words reveal that thou hast not recognized the establishment of Him Who conversed on Sinai upon the throne of Manifestation. The world is a different world and the Cause a different Cause. Open thine eyes that perchance thou mayest become aware and attain unto the splendors of the Day of God. Be fair - had it not been for this Wronged One, would thy father have possessed such power and strength as to arise before the faces of the world and speak that which transformed the darkness of vain imaginings into the light of certitude? Be fair and be not of the wrongdoers. This Wronged One arose to proclaim the Cause in days when the limbs of the world trembled with fear. Were it not for Baha, who would have dared to speak before the faces of the world and deliver the verses of God, the Lord of all worlds? He hath said that should anyone produce a single verse, reject him not. Ponder this utterance, that perchance thou mayest become aware of the wrong committed against this Wronged One. Now, despite countless revealed verses and manifest proofs, thou dost continue to instill hatred in the hearts of the weak. Nothing but falsehood hath appeared from you in every matter. Haji Siyyid Javad was with this Wronged One; his petitions in his own handwriting still exist, and We sent two of his letters to the land of Ya and other regions wherein appeared that which proved the truth and still exists. Nevertheless, they have obtained his photograph and included it with some other photographs and that of Mirza Yahya, made copies of all and distributed them among the people. Where is justice? Whither has fairness fled? Apart from all this, would ye be content that another sect like the Shi’ih sect should appear in the world? What was manifested on the Day of Judgment from their thousand and two hundred years of deeds? Reflect, and with the power of justice and fairness, break the back of tyranny and oppression. By God! We desire naught for thee but good, and We desire only to guide thee to the straight path of God and His mighty Message. For a thousand and two hundred years that sect considered themselves the most learned and distinguished of all people, yet on the Day of Judgment they were seen to be the most lost. From the year sixty until now, all the divines have been engaged in cursing and vituperation from their pulpits. By God! We hear the lamentation of the pulpits saying: “O my God! Thou didst create us for the exaltation of Thy Word, Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and Thou hearest, O my God, the wailing of the dwellers of Thy Paradise and the inhabitants of Thy sacred precincts. O Lord! Deliver us from these embodiments of tyranny and oppression, and adorn us with Thy near servants and sincere trusted ones.”</p>
<p>Now again they are occupied with forming a party like the Shia party, bringing up mentions of succession and casting hatred in people’s hearts against a station from which naught but the Most Great Mercy was manifest, which nurtured and protected thy father and those with him under the wing of loving-kindness. Rend asunder the veils of idle fancy! I swear by the Sun of Truth shining from the horizon of the prison of Akka that no purpose was intended save the guidance of the servants. Say: In the name of God and by God, and arise from thy station, turning toward the Kaaba of God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting, and say: “My God, my God! I have abandoned the community of people who believed not in Thee and Thy signs. Aid me to purify hearts and souls through the Kawthar and the Euphrates and the Salsabil that have flowed from the mouth of Thy Will and Purpose.”</p>
<p>O Hadi! Beseech God not to afflict His servants anew with the vain imaginings of the Shia party. Those same imaginings were transformed into bullets and on the Day of Retribution were visited upon the Lord of the world. This Wronged One’s purpose hath never been and is not religious leadership, but rather to purify the world from the calumnies and falsehoods of the past, and likewise to extinguish the fire of hatred hidden and concealed in the hearts of the various parties. We have sacrificed Our life for the reformation of the world and the education of the peoples. Some were not and are not worthy to hearken unto this call, for in the first instance they must ascend the steps of names and aim for the heaven of inner meanings. Not every weak one is capable of this arena, and not every horseman is worthy of this field.</p>
<p>O Hadi! Great is the Cause of God. Reflect upon the Twin Luminous Lights, that is, Hasan and Husayn, and be fair: despite their glory, wealth and exaltation, they freely sacrificed their lives at the feet of the Beloved of the worlds. Likewise other souls, which all have heard about and know. And consider the conduct of Mirza Hadi Dawlat-Abadi, who for successive years remained concealed behind a veil, but when the Ishqabad affair and the favors of His Majesty the Sultan became apparent in Tehran, and likewise when the light shone forth from the influence of the Supreme Word and the power of the Most Exalted Pen, and the Cause became manifest and the Euphrates flowed, he rushed forth. Would that he had remained in his initial concealment, for no sooner did he hear himself called a Babi than he mounted the pulpit and uttered that which caused the eyes of the Concourse on High to weep blood. In those days both His Honor Ashraf was seized and that same word was spoken concerning him. Now Ashraf lies beneath the earth while he moves about with throne and pomp. What was the cause of the first one’s martyrdom and what was the reason for the second one’s survival? Know thou and thou shalt know, and the world shall know that the first one’s martyrdom was due to truthfulness, sincerity and sacrifice, while the second one’s survival was due to falsehood, denial and hypocrisy. He was the only one of that party who was heard to have come forth - and would that he had not left his house and had not uttered what he uttered! Yea, they have attributed and continue to attribute every good thing to themselves.</p>
<p>Among them was Siyyid Isma’il-i-Zavari’i who was with this Wronged One in Iraq, and the matter concerning him hath been revealed in detail from the heaven of utterance in another place. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen and shown justice in the Cause of God and the penetration of His most exalted Word. One night he came wearing the turban of the Imam, and went to the Gate, and afterward proceeded to the place of sacrifice, and turning toward the House, performed that which caused the company of them who are detached to be astonished. Although that deed was not permissible, yet the fire of love had taken possession of his entire being. There occurred no meeting between him and Mirza Yahya - to this testifieth he who was with Us in Iraq.</p>
<p>Hearken thou unto the voice of this Wronged One. Know thou of a certainty that the Successor is he who hath bidden the servants to serve Me, and the Guardian is he who hath stood before My gate, and the Leader is he who hath announced to the people My Manifestation before My face, and the Qa’im is he who hath informed the servants of the heaven of My utterance and the ocean of My bounty. We beseech God to grant all the grace to return. Time and again there hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen mention of stations that would suffice, yet the servants have departed from justice and are bereft of fairness, save whom God willeth.</p>
<p>Hearken thou unto this Wronged One and speak not with unseemly words and unacceptable imaginings of the Shi’ih sect, and beseech God to sanctify the Cause from the like of that party. From the earliest days until now, luminous, holy and speaking Tablets have rained like the rain from Iraq and the Land of Mystery and the Most Great Prison upon those regions, until it hath reached this stage that in Sudan someone made mention and now a hundred thousand souls have arisen to serve him. The testament of this Wronged One is that thou shouldst ponder upon the Shi’ih sect and their deeds and words on the Day of Resurrection and Manifestation, that perchance thou mayest return unto the truth and deliver thyself from vain imaginings. By the life of God! Baha hath not uttered, nor will He ever utter, aught from mere desire, but rather that which will draw the people nigh unto the Most Sublime Horizon. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The breaths of pride and leadership have seized the deniers, who at every moment cling to some word and worship some name. Were they to reflect for but a moment, they would bring themselves from the darkness into the blessed realm of light. Every possessor of life should ponder what has been manifested, and likewise consider by what proof and by what evidence he has clung to the Point of the Bayan, and likewise before that to Muhammad the Messenger of God. The All-Bountiful has withheld from all the recompense of their deeds. They have denied the Lord of Dominion, Whose verses have encompassed the world and Whose evidences are more luminous than the sun, notwithstanding that each of the attributes that has dawned from the horizon of will is a supreme proof and a most brilliant and glorious evidence. When all were veiled, He arose before all faces and, without veil or covering, made all aware of that which would draw them near and profit them. Glory be to God! Such is the power of the Most Exalted Word that now in all gatherings of divines, princes and mystics this Cause is mentioned and its investigation pursued. All should give thanks for this bounty, yet instead they have complained and continue to complain. While tribulations and afflictions descend from every direction and spears fly from every side, He has guided and inspired His loved ones and chosen ones to that which befits these days. Among other matters is the great city where every day they attribute some theft to a soul and trace it back to the Manifestation of the Sea of Sanctity. Previously they made such accusations against the Nazir, upon him be the Glory of God. You have surely heard how in these days too, when his honor the Afnan, Alif and Ha, upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God, intended to journey to this direction, the deniers resorted to new intrigues and informed the embassy and others that the aforementioned personage had stolen ninety pounds in cash as well as banknotes and gone to Akka. In brief, they have spread all these calumnies from the island, and Shaykh Muhammad Yazdi, at the instigation of the hidden oppressor, has become the cause of these false events. It is reported that Akhtar has given his daughter in marriage to the son of Mulla Ja’far Kirmani. If in these days the station of sanctification and detachment remains hidden from some, ere long the veil shall be lifted and all shall testify to that which has flowed from the Supreme Pen in books, pages and tablets. The servant beseeches his Lord to transform the oppression of the oppressors into justice, their darkness into light, and their rejection into acceptance. Verily He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Some time ago the honored Habib of the Green Land - upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness - sent a letter to His Honor the Name of Bounty - upon him be the Most Glorious Glory of God - mentioning that Hadi Dawlat-Abadi had arrived in that land with company and equipment and had taken up residence in the home of His Honor Khalil - upon him be the Glory of God. From the beginning, the gaze of loving-kindness was directed towards him and Tablets and Holy Writings were repeatedly sent to him. Beseech God to protect him from the deadly poison. Verily the Servant beseeches his Lord night and day to protect His servants from the evil of those who have violated His Covenant and Testament, who have denied Him and His verses. For God and His sake I submit to the friends that they should arise, through the power and might of God, exalted be His Glory, to do that which will protect the servants of God, lest a party like the Shi’ih party appear in the land. They boasted in the name of the successor, but when the Day of Reckoning appeared, all their divines issued the verdict to martyr the King of existence - One through Whose power a hundred thousand successors have been and are being created. Him they unjustly hanged and martyred. This one fact suffices regarding the virtues of that party. It is hoped that His Honor Khalil - upon him be the Glory of God - will not forget the Covenant of the Glorious Lord, will deliver himself from the clay and water of the people, and will arise with divine power to render assistance. Glory be to God! Once again eyes have been veiled by the veils of the past, and likewise ears have become accustomed to false statements. We beseech God to cause all to attain to that which is befitting. At one time this exalted Word was revealed and uttered from the tongue of the Lord of all being, blessed and exalted be His Word:</p>
<p>“O people of God! Turn to the Holy Writings and purify your ears from the false statements of the unworthy ones, lest you be afflicted in the well of vain imaginings as in the past. This is the Sun of counsel that has dawned from the horizon of the Supreme Pen. Blessed are they that behold and blessed are they that hear.”</p>
<p>This servant is bewildered, nay the world of justice and fairness is bewildered. The Author of the Bayan - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - states: “I have written a gem concerning His mention, which is that He shall not be known by My allusions nor by what hath been revealed in the Bayan.” And in another place He states, exalted be His mention: “Should anyone bring forth a single verse, reject him not.” For what purpose were these statements revealed? What was intended? Blessed are the fair-minded! At all times they have resorted to intrigues and schemes the like of which have never been heard. This servant has at all times sought for all that which leads to success and prosperity. Though all know that this servant was ever-present and aware of all matters, they do not inquire of him, but rather inquire of heedless souls concerning that which they persist in. In truth, they are clinging to the cord of suppositions and idle fancies and holding fast to the hem of falsehood.</p>
<p>Likewise Habib of the Green Land - upon him be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness - has mentioned that their Honors Nayyir and Sina - upon both be the Glory of God - arrived in this land and the deputies of the Prince - may God strengthen him - sought to meet with them. Since it was contrary to wisdom, they promised to meet upon their return. Now if someone should proceed to those parts with some Tablets and Books and speak with wisdom and utterance to the aforementioned official and the seekers, perhaps a true seeker might turn towards the Most Great Ocean and attain to that which is intended.</p>
<p>O my God! Prevent not them that seek from beholding the horizon of Thy Revelation, nor them that yearn from attaining unto the wellspring of Thy inspiration and the dayspring of Thine utterance. Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Commander, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Several years ago it was written that one of the well-known friends in that land was summoned, but in the meeting they did not attain what they had intended, for the one who was present and whose presence they sought concealed the Cause and in no way uttered a word that might ignite the fire of attraction or cause recognition. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to inspire His friends in such circumstances with that which would cause all faces to turn to the lights of His countenance. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Hadi Dawlat-Abadi has passed through those regions and his poison has somewhat affected some. Therefore it is necessary that one of the detached souls should, for the sake of God, proceed to those parts. The purpose is that another sect like unto the Shi’ih sect may not again come into existence in the world. The friends must exert their utmost endeavor in this matter, as a mercy and a favor to the servants. In these days you must hold fast unto the cord of kindliness and prudence, for the noxious odors of irreligiosity have, to some degree, affected most people. Therefore, as soon as a word is uttered, they will disclose what is hidden, causing the fire of discord to be kindled. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to grant you success and to aid you, even as He aided you in the nights and days, to establish His Cause through wisdom and utterance.</p>
<p>No deed is ever lost, nor shall it ever be lost, and likewise that which is recorded in the Book that is ever present before Him shall never be effaced. What was mentioned regarding Hadi ibn Yahya was intended for the information of others, not him, for he was not and is not worthy. I convey greetings, praise, glory and splendor to the friends of that land. It is hoped that with dignity, composure, patience and fortitude they will bring these tumultuous days to an end. God willing, may there appear from each one that which would cause the fire of hatred to subside and the Most Great Word to be exalted. I beseech God to illumine the world with the lights of the Luminary of utterance. Verily, He is powerful over what He willeth. Glory, remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those who are with you, who love you and who hearken to your words concerning the Cause of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of them that are nigh and sincere.</p>
<p>The Servant</p>
<p>18th of Safar 1308</p>
<p>=== END BH00131 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00132 ===</p>
<p>In the name of Him Who hath dominion over all things! The seal of the choice Wine hath been broken through My Name, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed are they who recognize that verily it is the Kawthar of the All-Merciful manifested in the contingent world and the Quickener of all beings, having been mingled with the tribulation of the Beloved. We have brought forth from the Point the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be, and have detailed therefrom that which none knoweth save God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Verily, the people have not followed that which they were counseled by the Lord of all beings. Had they followed, they would not have cast the Book of God behind their backs, nor turned away from the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>
<p>Among them are those who say He hath come before the appointed time. Say: Is the knowledge of the appointed time with you or with God, the Revealer of verses? Be fair and follow not every vain imagining. Among them are some who say God hath purified the seed, that all may know that whatever appeareth from the Dayspring of Being was indeed pure. Say: Yea, by my Lord! He is indeed the Pure, the Most Pure, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Therefore they conclude that He will appear afterwards. Say: The before and after are with thee, not with Him in Whose grasp is the dominion of all things. Say: Every seed from which We have brought forth the Dawning-Places of Revelation - all are pure and purified. This is God’s decree, both aforetime and hereafter, did ye but know.</p>
<p>This matter needeth no mention or explanation, for it is among the fundamental ordinances in a hidden Tablet. The Point intended by this mention naught save His absorption in the remembrance of the Intended One and His stations, which none can know save every loved one consumed in the fire of the Beloved. Among them are those who said that the Revealer of the Bayan wrote what the Intended One would recite among children, and thereby were perplexed in the Cause of the All-Merciful. Say: Is the knowledge of the Book with you, or with Him Who possesseth the Preserved Tablet? Say: Be not among the unjust. Open the eye of fairness and speak not that which would consume hearts and minds. Interpret not according to your desires what God hath placed above your understanding. Ask of him who speaketh the truth from the presence of the Truth, the Knower of the unseen, though He hath forbidden questioning in this Revelation lest there come before His presence that which would sadden Him and prevent Him from mention of His Self, the One Who dominateth all witnesses and witnessed things. Yet We have permitted you, as a bounty from Our presence, lest the doubts of nations who follow vain imaginings and wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and pride keep you from the Most Great Ocean.</p>
<p>Say: He intended by mention of the seed and what is above it naught save My remembrance, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: He was with My Name in the evening and with My remembrance in the morning, did ye but know. O people of the Bayan! Be fair in the name of the All-Merciful. Should diverse utterances come to you from the Manifestation of clear proofs, whom would ye question and to whom would ye turn to inform you of what the Chosen One hath ordained in the inscribed Tablet? All that hath been revealed in the Tablets ultimately returneth to a single point wherein the sincere find no difference, could ye but understand. None knoweth the interpretation of the Book and what the All-Bountiful intended save him from whom, through His Name, the ocean of Revelation hath flowed forth and from whom the fountains of wisdom and streams of knowledge have branched. All utterances lead to this Word spoken by the Tongue of the Bayan, would ye but perceive it. He said that should He appear at this very moment, none hath the right to object to Him. He doeth what He willeth. He is verily the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. None possesseth knowledge of His Revelation. He appeareth as He pleaseth and when He pleaseth. Thus hath the matter been decreed, would ye but be certain. Say: Beware lest what is in the Bayan prevent you from meeting Him when the Call is raised. Leave behind what ye possess[…]</p>
<p>At whatever time He pleaseth - thus hath the matter been decreed, would ye but know it with certainty. Say: Beware lest that which is in the Bayan prevent you from meeting Him when the Call is raised. Cast aside all that ye possess and turn ye unto that most praiseworthy Station. Whoso pondereth these verses which have been sent down from the heaven of the Command will cry out and say: “I believe in Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!” Blessed is he who hath freed himself from the depths of allusions and turned, in a spirit of detachment, unto the Countenance. Say: O people of Baha! It behooveth you to soar today in an atmosphere that transcendeth the allusions of words and the doubts of them that have denied God when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared. Say: All that was revealed in the Bayan hath been made specifically for this Revelation - reflect that ye may understand. Say: Have ye the knowledge of the unseen, or is it with Him Who created all things? Fear God and follow not the paths of fancy. Every matter is weighed by this Balance, and by its very self, would ye but know it. Say: Through Him were the standards of innovation raised upon every lofty banner. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee that thou mayest remind the servants thereby. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Generous, the Forgiving. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen.</p>
<p>This was revealed in answer to one who asked about what was mentioned in the Seven Proofs:</p>
<p>His words, exalted and glorified be He: Among the conclusive proofs is the knowledge of all things in a single soul, which knowledge hath been concealed and treasured in the Book of the Single Temples, and none before this hath been apprised thereof. The fruit thereof is that one observeth in the letters how all things are gathered together in eleven degrees, which constitute the Temple of Identity, and when thou causest the first Temple to move in the sea of names, it reacheth unto nineteen and entereth not into twenty. The revelation of this knowledge is a conclusive proof unto all, would they but understand.</p>
<p>In the name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath made the ornament of the Tablets of Numbers to be the One, which was sanctified above all single numbers, and made it the source of derivation in the Kingdom of Creation. Verily, it counteth not itself among the numbers from which numbers are compounded, in such wise that it can never be exhausted. When it shone forth through its sovereignty upon its pillars, there appeared the Four which is the completion of Ten, and through it were concluded the degrees of mathematical figures in the stations of remembrance and allusions. Every discerning one seeth, at the conclusion of this station, the form of the Beginning in the first of numbers. Then did the suns of Names shine forth from the horizon of this heaven in the degrees and lines which were determined according to the number of the Vav and Ha that were established therein in the worlds of accomplishment after decree. When the lines adorned with Names appeared according to the number of Our Name, the All-Glorious, We adorned with them the First Temple and made it the source of causes, and from it We detailed the Temples and Names until the Temples ended at the Twenty-Ninth Temple and the Names at Our Name, the Help in Peril, which We made the ultimate end of Names in numbers and their measure in the kingdom of creation. Thus ended the journey of the First Temple in the seas of Names unto this most exalted station, yet it reached not unto the sea of Kaf in the kingdom of beginning. Then We made the establishment of the Temples and Numbers and the objects of those Names through the manifestation of the Square by this Triangle, whereby all upon earth were thunderstruck save those who held fast to the luminous Handle - and it is the Triangle which was the first of forms and their source, and the fountainhead of numbers and their sovereign. And verily these are outwardly possessed of straight sides and lines which were not ordained to descend, and inwardly that which none hath understood save God, the Lord of the Throne and earth, and the Creator of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>And as to what thou hast asked concerning the knowledge that was hidden in God’s knowledge and treasured within the veil of grandeur and glory, know thou that the Point of the Bayan desired by its revelation naught else save that all should know their beginning and their return, lest the multiplicities of the worlds of names and the visible utterances of letters in the kingdom of creation should prevent them from turning unto Him Whom God hath made the Source and Return of all things. Thus hath the matter been decreed by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. None can comprehend the greatness of this knowledge save he who beholdeth it with the eye of God, and without this none hath any share of this great depth. God hath revealed this knowledge for the recognition by men of the Source from which the letters have proceeded and every wise command. Verily God, blessed and exalted be He, hath created limited letters and made them sources of knowledge amongst the servants. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the Powerful. And these letters and numbers, all of them, began from the Primal Point and the First Pattern, which is the One without number, and unto it do they return on His wondrous Day. The fruit of this knowledge and the fruits of all knowledge is the recognition of the Known One Who hath appeared after the Qayyum in His Name the Self-Subsisting. Whoso hath attained unto this hath ascended unto the ultimate goal and hath known the Beginning and the End. And whoso is deprived of the fruit in this Most Great Day is among the most ignorant of creation, even should he bring forth the knowledge of the first and the last ones. Say: The knower is he who hath known the Known One, and the learned is he who hath drawn nigh unto the Known One, and he who is remote, verily he is the imaginary one, by the Lord of the worlds. All things have been limited by whatsoever hath been created in earth and heaven by everything - this is a word that encompasseth what hath been created and what shall be created by the Mighty, the Powerful. And verily these have been limited to nineteen units in the Book of God, and every unit began from the First Unit, and verily it is from the Point that speaketh: “There is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” And God desired naught except to teach the people the Dawning-Place of the Cause and its Rising-Point, lest the manifestations of the worlds of names should prevent them from the Creator of heaven, and the allusions of the people of creation from the Source of verses and their Return. Thus hath God detailed what He desired in a clear Tablet. Verily he who hath drunk the wine of revelation from this Cup will not alter a single letter of what We have sent down in the Kingdom of the dominion of the heavens and earths. Then know thou that the Book of the Unity hath been sent down from the presence of the One to this Single One, but for Whom the face of creation would not have been adorned with the beauty of detachment, nor the tablet of invention with the ornament of the Point from which all things have been detailed. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the kingdom of decree from the Dawning-Place of the revelation of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Blessed is he who hath found the sweetness of utterance in the days of the All-Merciful. He would not exchange it for all the books of the earth. To this beareth witness the King of the realms of eternity from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Informed. And We adorned that Book with Our Most Beautiful Names in the lines of the Vav and the Ha, then We made them the ornament of the First Temple that it might tell of the Pure Identity among the nations. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Powerful. And We ordained in the first line letters which We made the source and return of all things, that the seeing one might behold in that line the lines branching from the ocean of the Point, and might become aware of the beginning of manifestations and multiplicities from the first and last ones, and might be of the assured ones. And We revealed from their numbers a Name from the Names, that it might proclaim in the kingdom of creation that there is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then in the second line are points telling of the stations of unity […]</p>
<p>We revealed from their numbers a Name among the names, that it might proclaim throughout the kingdom of creation that there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then in the second line were points representing the ranks of ones, tens and hundreds, and We added to them points for the three ranks and that which indicates the thousand in the inscribed figures. And We revealed from them another name - thus was the matter decreed from the presence of the Lord of Destiny in this noble scene. Then in the third were corresponding alifs until the lines were completed in the number of Our Most Glorious Name and the seas of geometry and figures ended at the geometry indicating nine, for God has ordained no geometry beyond it. All forms and shapes have culminated in this geometry which tells of the Most Great Name, which God has made the Dawning-Place of names and their source for all who are in the heavens and earth. When the realities of all things were gathered in eleven scrolls in the Temple of the Divine Identity, We made it the First Embroidery and the Speaker of this Name which God has made the Master of Causes and the Source of religions for all the worlds. When We adorned the heaven of that Temple with the suns of names, Our True Name appeared from the corresponding ta’s at the ultimate stations, and in this are signs and clear proofs for those who know. This is what God intended in the mystery of mysteries from the mystery veiled by mystery in this Great Announcement. Blessed is he who has recognized this mystery, from the burden of which all in the heavens and earth fled in terror, save those who turned their gaze away from all things and set their faces toward the scene of God, the Mighty, the Generous. When the creation of the First Temple was completed through this Most Great Name, We derived from it the Temples. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wise. Know then that We caused that Name which We revealed in the ultimate stations and lines to traverse a sea among the seas of names by adding to it its like, whereupon Our Name “the Embroiderer” appeared in that straight channel. Then We caused it to traverse another sea and another name rose from its dawning-place. Then in the stages of its journey through each of the seas a name among the names appeared until it reached the ultimate of the Temples, the Twenty-ninth Temple, whereupon the sun of Our Name “the One Who Calls for Help” shone forth from that manifest and evident horizon. At that point the journeys and seas came to an end, for God has not ordained among the names a greater number than this exalted Name. Therefore He said - and His word is the truth - that it reaches not unto twenty. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. If thou shouldst add to this Name, no name would appear from it as appeared in the ranks We have explained to thee. Reflect that thou mayest know what thy Lord intended aforetime and in this wondrous Tablet. Thus has the sun of utterance shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord, the Most Merciful, as a grace from Him unto thee and unto those who ask. If thou wouldst reflect, the proof of this knowledge and that mighty Book would become manifest to thee, and it is, in its inner reality, the manifestation of Truth in the One Who Calls for Help. By My life, this is indeed the purpose - blessed are they who attain! We testify that all that hath appeared in the Proof or shall appear is God’s proof unto all else and His testament unto all in the kingdom. Then We shall explain to thee what the Point intended in the inmost heart of His utterance, that thou mayest be of the thankful. By the Twenty-ninth He intended naught but this most impregnable and exalted Manifestation. As for the nine, ye were promised it in the Book in His words “In the nine ye shall attain all good,” even as there appeared therein the Manifestation of God […]</p>
<p>As the Nine had been promised unto you in the Book where He saith “Within the Nine ye shall attain unto all good,” even so was made manifest therein the Revelation of God and His mystery according to a fixed measure. And by the other years were meant those years that were appointed for the respite, as revealed in the Bayan. And when these were fulfilled and the Promise came, the Promised One appeared with a sovereignty that encompassed all who dwell in the realm of the seen and the unseen. And His words “It shall not reach unto Kaf” signified that the twentieth year would not be completed ere He would be made manifest with the truth, with evident sovereignty. O thou herald! Convey unto the people what God intended in the mystery of the Book of the Temples from God’s Most Great Treasury, that they may be of them that know. Say: In His mention He intended naught save the Goal of all who dwell on earth. When the creation of the First Unity was completed and from it the Temples were differentiated, He called upon his Lord in His communion, saying: “O my God! Guide Thou that Unity and that Being unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, that they may not be veiled from the Manifestation of Thyself, inasmuch as they were created for Him.” Thus was the matter decreed. Blessed are they that attain! Were anyone to ponder this utterance and comprehend what the All-Merciful intended, he would melt with the fire of yearning and would recognize the grandeur of this Cause and its sovereignty. Yet most people remain heedless. O thou who hast dawned from the horizon of certitude and art mentioned by the tongue of the All-Merciful in the highest paradise! Know thou that every mention hath ended at this most mighty station and every description at this most luminous spot. When the Point praiseth a soul in the Bayan, He saith: “Beware lest praise veil thee from the Most Glorious Horizon,” and when He describeth anyone with names, He addresseth him thus: “Beware lest the garment of names prevent thee from Him round Whom circle Their suns in adoration before His beauteous countenance.” Observe how He praised the Letters in the most wondrous manner possible in creation and in the most glorious way that could be mentioned in invention. Then He addresseth the people of the Bayan, saying: “Beware lest ye be veiled by these Letters from the Lord of Names and Attributes.” Blessed is he who hath recognized God’s purpose in what He hath truthfully revealed and who hath remained steadfast upon this straight path. And when He mentioneth Him Whom all shall seek, He saith that should He appear at that very moment, His command must be obeyed and His wish fulfilled. None may object to Him; rather must all acknowledge Him and thank God for this supreme bounty. O My Name! Reflect upon the allusions in the words of Him Who revealed the verses, that the fragrances of reunion in this culmination, which hath been the ultimate hope of the Messengers, may seize thee. Verily, he who hath not recognized the Purpose hath been deprived of God and His sovereignty and what He hath revealed unto the sincere ones. Say: Beware lest the multitude of what hath been revealed in the Bayan veil you from the Source of the Bayan, and lest the manifestations of the worlds of words veil you from the Horizon whence rose the suns of meaning and exposition from God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. By My life, O My Name! Were We to reveal books concerning the Temples and what lieth beyond them, it would be easier for Me than to interpret what We have previously revealed, for though interpretation is indeed a momentous matter, yet it is the province of every learned one aware among the people of Baha whose hearts are connected with this mighty ocean. Blessed is the learned one whom the breezes of revelation have seized in the days of God and have caused him to forget all creation and whatsoever hath been mentioned therein, speaking forth this remembrance whereby the oceans of life have gushed forth amidst all worlds. He is among the most exalted of creation before the Truth, for the station of the learned one who hath embarked upon the Crimson Ark in the Most Glorious Name among the people is as the station of sight among the senses. It behooveth all to revere him.</p>
<p>As for the one who spoke with this Remembrance, through which the rivers of life burst forth amidst the worlds - verily, he is among the most exalted of creatures before the Truth. For the station of the learned one who has embarked upon the crimson ark in the Most Glorious Name amongst the people is as the station of sight among the senses. It behooveth everyone to honor him and to magnify him. Thus was it sent down aforetime and at this hour. Then blessed is the learned one who hath adorned himself with the raiment of detachment in creation and with the cloak of godliness among men, and who hath been so attracted by hearkening to this Call that he hath gone forth from his homeland, traveling through the countries in remembrance of the All-Merciful. Verily, he is of those who have drawn nigh and are sincere.</p>
<p>O Khalil! This is uttered in the Persian tongue, that all creation might partake of the fragrant breezes of divine utterances and attain to that which God hath willed. The Point of the Bayan hath revealed a Book concerning the Single Temples, wherein He hath gathered all things within eleven lines corresponding to the number of ‘Huva’ and the Most Splendid Name. In the first line He inscribed the letters of the abjad, and from its twenty-eight letters, which are the source and return of all things, He derived the name Vahid. In the second line He took the dots marking the ranks of ones, tens, hundreds and thousands, wherefrom the name Mahbub was derived. In the third line He recorded similar alifs, such as one (1), ten (10), eleven (11), one hundred (100), one hundred and one (101), one hundred and ten (110), one hundred and eleven (111), and so forth. He calculated all similar letters in like manner, not exceeding the number of Al-Mustaghath, which He established as the measure of numbers. From these similar alifs He derived the name Baydavi. Similarly He recorded in each line the equivalents of each abjad letter and derived therefrom a name, until He reached the similar ta’s, which represent the ultimate degree of geometry and forms in the material world, from which He derived the name Haqq. In this are signs for those who observe and reflect. All these names He gathered in the First Single Temple, which is Oneness without number. Thereafter He caused each of the names gathered in the Temple of Identity to traverse an ocean from among the oceans of names, deriving other names therefrom, from which He arranged the Second Temple, until the Temples ended with the nineteenth, beyond which progress according to the established rule is impossible, for at the end of the nineteenth Temple the names culminate in Al-Mustaghath with the alif and lam, above which there exists no name in numbers from which to arrange a final Temple. In brief, He determined eleven names corresponding to the number of ‘Huva’ and ‘Bahhaj’ in the eleven lines and degrees, as mentioned. The number of these eleven names also corresponds to the name Al-Mutakabbir. Then from this the First Single Temple appeared, and when they added once to the numbers of these names, eleven other names appeared, wherefrom He raised up the Second Single Temple. Likewise when they added twice to the numbers of the names of the First Single Temple, other names appeared wherefrom the Third Single Temple was manifested. Thus did they add at each degree until it concluded with the nineteenth Temple. All these Temples appeared and came into being from the First Temple itself. Let it not be imagined that the Second Temple came from the First, the Third from the Second, and the Fourth from the Third, as would appear in calculation to those possessed of understanding. Thereby it is proven that God is the Truth, that He is the Creator and all else His creation, and all things are before Him in a single plane. Thus doth God expound His Cause that ye may be among the believers in His unity. Observe how the Most Great Name appeared from the similar ta’s at the end of the eleven lines.</p>
<p>And all are before Him in one plane. Thus doth God expound His Cause that ye may be of them that comprehend. Look ye unto truth, in that at the end of the eleven lines there appeared the letters ?a, evocative of the Most Great Name, and by it was the first temple completed, for at the end of the names of the first temple this blessed name dawned forth. This name moved through one of the seas of names; its like was added unto it, and the name ?arraz appeared, and by it was the second temple completed. Again it moved through another sea; twice its like was added unto it, and the name Shaydud appeared, and by it was the third temple completed. And likewise in every sea of seas there was added unto it, and a name appeared, and a temple from among the temples was by that name completed, until in the nineteenth sea, which was the ultimate of seas, there appeared the name Mustaghath with the alif and lam, and by it was the nineteenth temple completed. It was impossible to go beyond this station, for were one to add to the numerical value of Mustaghath, no name would appear, since among the divine names commonly known among men none existeth with a numerical value greater than this name. This is why He saith that if thou movest the first temple through the sea of names it will be completed at nineteen and will not reach the sea of kaf. And it is known that eleven numbers are lacking from the numbers of the name Mustaghath. He saith that from these eleven numbers were created eleven lines. Here reflection is needed. The meaning is that from the eleven numbers of the name Mustaghath, which pertaineth to the Sovereign of Names, were created eleven lines, and from that arose the first single temple. Blessed is he who drinketh the pure water of mystic knowledge from this Cup, whereby the life of the worlds was suspended.</p>
<p>O proclaimer! Just as the name of Truth traversed all the cities of names and their kingdom in nineteen stations, or nineteen degrees, or nineteen seas, and reached Our name Mustaghath, so too did the Self of Truth traverse time in nineteen years and appear in Mustaghath. This is the meaning of the Book of the Temples, but most people do not understand. Were they to reflect, they would be convinced that His purpose in that Book was none other than what We have mentioned to thee, and they would thank the Lord for this lucid exposition. We desire to cast upon the servants clear, manifest, and transcendent utterances, that they may understand according to their capacity what their Ancient Lord intended. And We have utterances and melodies, then other melodies which none hath discovered save God, and in every letter thereof is concealed the greatest depth of divine mysteries, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have repeated and do repeat these words that God’s purpose may become as manifest as the sun at high noon. This is naught but a great bounty.</p>
<p>Know thou that Our name Mustaghath appeared from the Truth made manifest from the letters ?a which indicate the Most Great Name. Therefore, behold the Mustaghath made manifest from the Name which emerged from the Sovereign of Names in Mustaghath, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Creator of the worlds! By My life, this is God’s greatest mystery and His mightiest treasure and His Cause adorned with the ornament of eternity and His hidden talisman in a perspicuous Book. Know thou the purpose of Mustaghath which was revealed in the Tablets and the manifestation of Truth therein. This verily is the spirit of life in the Bayan, whereby it soared and moved and trembled and proclaimed: There is none other God but Me, the Protector over all worlds.</p>
<p>Know that what was meant by the mention of the Divine Right and His maturity after the passing of nineteen stations in the name of Him Who is Implored for Help is the Manifestation of Truth after the passing of nineteen years at the time of Mustaghath. This and this alone was and is meant. Say: The fragrances of eternity have wafted over the world and the Sun of Utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of possibility. Well is it with them that perceive.</p>
<p>O My Name! All that was revealed in the Bayan concerning the mention of the Most Great Remembrance was revealed with utmost clarity. That which was made the cause of distinguishing the people and the degrees of recognition and the appearance of tests was the mention of Mustaghath, and now the meaning thereof hath been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Clear Tablet - that which until now they have neither understood nor comprehended. The people are weak, and most have drunk the milk of vain imaginings from the breast of idle fancy. This is why they remain deprived of the Self-Subsisting through such mentions. Observe that after mentioning Mustaghath, in most statements He saith that should He appear at that time, all must offer thanks and praise unto the True God and be content with whatsoever God hath ordained for them. There is no doubt that this latter statement predominates and encompasses all other statements, for from the second wafteth the fragrance of the Self-Subsisting as He passeth by, and from the first the fragrance of limitations is evident. Is there any possessor of smell who perceiveth the fragrance of the Bayan and is of the thankful? Is there any possessor of hearing who heareth and saith: “Thine be the praise, O God of all who are in the heavens and on earth”? In no case hath there been or is there for anyone occasion to hesitate. Thus doth the All-Merciful testify in the highest Paradise.</p>
<p>In some Names an increase or decrease is observed, and completion is with thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And that which the Point of the Bayan mentioned was meant to be the Most Great Remembrance, but most of the people of the Bayan have imagined from the Book of Temples and the like that it referred to numerology and other sciences. All are wandering in the wilderness of fancy. Every Tablet began with this Name and ended with this wise Remembrance.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning the Days, We have made them manifestations of the letter Ha’ in the kingdom of creation. Therefore they are not limited by the bounds of years and months. It behooveth those in the Days of Baha to feed themselves and then the poor and needy, and to glorify and praise and magnify their Lord with joy and delight. And when the Days are completed, they shall enter into the Fast. Thus hath the Lord of all beings decreed. These Days are expansion before contraction, and giving before withholding. Therefore must all engage in glorification and praise and magnification of the transcendent Lord with complete joy and delight and fragrance. In these Days, gathering and feasting and rejoicing are beloved before God. God willing, may all derive the utmost possible delight in these Days and then enter into the month of fasting. Well is it with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>Convey My greetings to My Afnan and give them glad tidings of how We have answered what they asked. He is verily the Answerer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Also to those who are there from among the loved ones of God, the Powerful, the Transcendent, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>
<p>The original text of this blessed Tablet, part of which has been lost, bears the number […]</p>
<p>=== END BH00132 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00133 ===</p>
<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing; He is the All-Seeing, the All-Wise!</p>
<p>If a soul, firm, steadfast, assured and upright be found, and for the sake of God, His love and His good-pleasure arise with perfect constancy like a banner upon the highest heights, and with loudest cry question all things as to what hath befallen the Wronged One in the path of God and what He hath purposed - by the life of God, all will cry out with loudest voice this most exalted Word: He hath come for the salvation of the world and the preservation of the nations, and hath desired naught but the exaltation of their stations and the elevation of their ranks, and hath borne what none hath borne before nor shall bear hereafter.</p>
<p>O Amin! I swear by the Manifest Cause that is evident and visible in the Most Great Prison that the hearing ear which, through the divine bounty, hath been purified from the false tales of the former times and the fabricated stories of the latter days will surely hear this call from all things. In all conditions there hath been revealed from the Pen of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, that which every just one hath testified to and every seeing one hath witnessed, regarding the refinement and purification of souls and the education of the world. Nevertheless, certain souls who claim adherence to the Truth have committed that which causeth the very essence of truth to weep. I swear by the Call that is raised today from the Sinai of divine knowledge that this Wronged One hath suffered at their hands that which hath no equal or likeness, to such extent that they have defiled the pure hem and clouded the luminous Cause. Every hearing one hath heard the lamentation of the divine Tablets and every seeing one hath perceived the sorrows inflicted. Some who claim to love have wrought that which hath left the Tablet and the Pen bewildered and dumbfounded. The sighs of the sincere ascend and the tears of the near ones descend.</p>
<p>In the Persian Hidden Words this most exalted Word was revealed from the Supreme Pen: “O My servant! Barter not the everlasting dominion for a single emanation, nor the sovereignty of the Celestial Paradise for a fleeting desire.” The counsels of the past and present bow down, nay prostrate themselves, before God’s exhortation in this Most Great Manifestation. Some have become so inflamed with the fire of self and passion that they have astonished the Concourse on High.</p>
<p>Your honor hath repeatedly attained the presence of the Most Holy Court through divine grace and infinite heavenly bounty, and hath repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur that which was the cause of life and sanctification, and the means of exaltation and purification. Now reflect upon the deeds of certain heedless souls - what was the counsel and what became the deed! O Amin! The treachery and falsehood of that claimant of love was sharper than a sword in striking at the body of the Cause. The tribulations of this Wronged One have been from the deeds of those who claim to love Him. In the past, the tongue of the Wronged One uttered these words: “My affliction is not My imprisonment and what hath descended upon Me from My enemies, but rather the deeds of My loved ones who attribute themselves to Me yet commit that which causeth My heart and My pen to lament.” In brief, such utterances have repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen. The deed of the enemy of God and the oppressor brought about in the great city that which had no equal or likeness. That faithless traitor, out of greed for wealth, forsook his ultimate end. The fire of his greed was so aflame that at every moment a new falsehood would appear from him. By the life of God, he hath passed beyond what is known […]</p>
<p>That faithless and unjust one, who, motivated by greed for wealth, lost sight of all consequences. The fire of his avarice was so inflamed that at every moment falsehoods issued from him. By the life of God, he forsook what is good and clung to evil. Through his treachery, a grievous blow was dealt to justice. In all conditions, beseech ye God that perchance they may become aware and return.</p>
<p>O Amin! All that thou didst write was presented before the Divine Presence, and this is the answer that now floweth from the Most Exalted Pen: Convey My greetings to the children of the one who ascended unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and gladden them with the effulgent rays of the Sun of Divine Providence. Verily, We mentioned him who was raised up when there issued from the Tongue of Will that which caused the ocean of forgiveness to surge and the fragrance of pardon and bounty to waft. God’s mercy encompassed him, and We made mention of each of his children. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to honor their eyes with beholding His signs and their ears with hearkening to that which hath been sent down for them from the Ancient Revealer. A special visitation prayer hath been revealed for that departed one, along with mention of his children. This shall be bestowed, and thou shalt convey it. Success and divine confirmation are within His mighty grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>The intention of Varqa, upon him be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy, was mentioned before Us and achieved the honor of acceptance. O Amin! Day and night he is occupied with service to the Cause and is blessed with the word of contentment. His affairs are confined to the mention of God’s Cause, the Lord of all worlds. In these days there hath befallen him that which hath befallen the loved ones. In thy letter thou didst mention that which causeth grief to those near unto God. We beseech God to aid him henceforth as He aided him before. Verily, He is with him in all conditions, and He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>His honor Haji Malik Husayn, upon him be My glory, hath attained unto the verses of the Most Exalted Pen. Verily God, thy Lord, preserved him, aided him, and seized his enemy with His might. He is the Seizer, the Strong, the Powerful. Remember him from Me and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous. We have desired at this moment to make mention of his son who was named Abdul-Husayn, that the attraction of this remembrance may draw him to a station wherein the might of tyrants shall not prevent him from the remembrance of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Husayn! Hearken unto the call from the direction of My Most Exalted Prison, from the Supreme Lote-Tree: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign of the invisible and the visible. Take thou the Most Exalted Cup in the name of thy Lord, the Lord of all beings, then drink therefrom the choice wine of the Most Glorious, despite every learned one whom knowledge hath prevented from turning towards Him Who is Known. Blessed art thou for having turned towards the Countenance when the people turned away, and for having heard the Call when heedless servants were debarred therefrom. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of those who fear not, neither shall they be grieved. Convey My glorification to thy mother and give her the glad-tidings of My mention of her from this praiseworthy station. O My handmaiden! Thou hast attained unto the hearing of this Most Exalted and Glorious Word, while the divines of Iran have not attained unto the word “O My servant.” Despite their seeking they are deprived, and despite their longing they are forbidden. True indeed are the words “Knowledge is the most great veil.” Would that they had attained unto true knowledge! They have devised vain imaginings and called them knowledge. Read what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an concerning them: “They have changed God’s favor into disbelief and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition.” The glory from Us be upon God’s loved ones in His earth and His beloved ones in His lands.</p>
<p>O Amin! If thou shouldst meet Muhammad (in M-N), say: Put aside all doubts, then turn to the fragrances of thy Lord’s revelation, the All-Informed Speaker. Were He to pronounce existence as non-existence, fire as water, or heaven as earth, none may say ‘why’ or ‘wherefore.’ Purify thy soul and heart from suspicions and imaginings, and turn thy face toward the City of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Verily He was with thee and heard thy words and what proceeded from thy mouth. He is indeed the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! None hath been or is aware of the requirements of God’s consummate wisdom. Hearken unto the counsel of the Wronged One - for God’s sake He speaketh it - be not a cause of deviation. Turn to the sacred Writings and listen with sanctified ears. They will guide thee to the straight path of God. Make not any accusation against one upon whom a hundred thousand afflictions have descended in the path of God. If thou canst not believe in the words of the Herald, be not a cause of grief. By God! The Point Himself - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - in the most exalted station of the supreme Paradise uttereth the words “Verily I am the foremost of them that worship.” Cast aside the vain imaginings of the immature ones of the world and say: “In the name of God and through God,” and turn from the left hand of fancy to the right hand of certitude. Verily He will protect thee and guide thee, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>O Amin! We wish at this moment to make mention of My handmaiden who hath attained unto My days, heard My sweetest call, and turned toward My most exalted horizon when most of mankind turned away. O Fatimah! Upon thee be My glory and the glory of those in My kingdom and the glory of the Concourse on High. I testify that thou hast attained unto the days of thy Lord, believed in Him, clung to the hem of His robe, and held fast to His cord. We beseech Him, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon thee at all times mercy from His presence and grace from His side. He is the Protector of every servant who hath believed in Him and every handmaiden who hath recognized Him, turned unto His path, and acknowledged that which He hath revealed in His Book. I testify that thou hast witnessed what God witnessed before the creation of the heavens and earth: that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden and My leaf! I testify that thou didst turn with such steadfastness that the clamor of the divines did not prevent thee from turning toward God, the Lord of the throne and of the dust, and the croaking of the wicked did not frighten thee from drawing nigh unto thy Chosen Lord, and the veils of glory did not hinder thee from turning toward the Self-Subsisting. Thou didst drink the wine of revelation from the hand of His bounty and didst attain unto the Kawthar of utterance in His days, and the attraction of the Call seized thee to such a station wherein all things bore witness to His unity and oneness. Joy be unto thee, O My handmaiden who art mentioned in My presence! We beseech God, exalted be He, once again, to adorn thee with the ornament of My Most Glorious Name in the highest Paradise. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Dominant over all who are in the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>We make mention of another handmaiden who was named Khadijih. O My handmaiden! Rejoice in how the Ancient Beauty hath made mention of thee from His Most Great Prison. [I swear] by My remembrance the ocean of bounty surged and the rains of mercy were sent down from the heaven of the grace of the Lord of all beings. I testify that thine ear was blessed to hearken unto His call, thine eye to behold His signs, and thy heart to turn unto Him. We beseech God to give thee to drink, at all times, from a cup of the Kawthar of eternity and a chalice in His Most Glorious Name. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and is the Overseer of all things. There is none other God but Him, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Thou hast ascended unto the Supreme Companion and attained that which was ordained for thee by God, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. Blessed art thou, and joy be unto thee and unto every servant and handmaiden who hath remembered thy days and what was revealed for thee from the direction of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God, Lord of existence and King of the seen and unseen! I beseech Thee by those who have ascended in Thy love unto Thee, who have sought Thy nearness and meeting, and who have attained unto the ocean of Thy bounty and presence before Thy face, that Thou send down upon the seekers the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy mercy; then forgive them through Thy grace and generosity. Verily, Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Amin! The Supreme Pen hath testified to thy service and the service of those related to thee, and hath ordained for each one that which beseemeth the oceans of His grace and generosity.</p>
<p>Convey mention and greetings from the Wronged One to the Leaf Hakimih. We testify that she hath attained unto turning toward My direction, hearkening unto My call, and beholding My signs. Upon her be My glory, My grace, and My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. Give her glad tidings that, by the life of God, she hath been and remaineth under the glances of God’s grace, and her deeds have attained unto acceptance and divine good-pleasure. Well is it with her and joy be unto her.</p>
<p>We make mention at this time of My other leaf who was named Kuchik. We have found from her the fragrance of the love of God, the Lord of the worlds, and We give her glad tidings of that which hath been ordained for her from the presence of an All-Knowing Ordainer. Praise be to God, they have attained unto the Most Exalted Word, which is “O My handmaiden”. By the lights of the Sun of Truth, the princesses of the earth have not attained unto that which these mentioned handmaidens have attained. Blessed is she and blessed is the one who hath taken her as a companion and helper.</p>
<p>And We make mention of My handmaiden who was named Maryam. O Maryam! Thou hast attained unto the mention of God. He hath turned toward thee from the direction of the Prison. He hath mentioned thee with that whereby thy name shall endure in His mighty and impregnable Kingdom. He hath forgiven thee, thy mother, and thy sister as a mercy from His presence. Verily, He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.</p>
<p>O Hasan! Upon thee be My glory. Thy toil and service have been mentioned before and are accepted by the Wronged One. We beseech God that He may aid thee in that which is the cause of everlasting remembrance. The deeds of no soul have been nor shall be lost. O servants! Know with clear certainty that goodly deeds and praiseworthy character, from whomsoever they have appeared or shall appear, their recompense is preserved and treasured with God. Soon shall the doers of deeds behold the reward of their actions with God, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Trustee! Since the handmaidens of God are related to Him and are His own, they must needs be adorned, both outwardly and inwardly, with the ornaments of that special distinction. From this date, which is the month of Shawwal al-Mukarram of the year 1306, each one should [receive] nine tumans annually, according to the number of the Greatest Name, from [God’s] presence, so that it may become clear and evident to all that they are of God, holding fast unto Him and related to Him. In successive years, most of what they have owned they have sent to the Most Holy Court, and your honor is also aware and [can testify] to what has been mentioned. And that which the handmaiden of God saw in her dream is the truth in which there is no doubt. We beseech God to make it a blessing unto her. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Overseer of all things great and small.</p>
<p>O My friends in Ta! The honored Trustee, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, arrived and made mention of each of the friends, both men and women, and each hath been blessed with the effulgences of the Luminary of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds. The world and all that is therein cannot equal one word that hath proceeded from the Dawning-Place of the utterance of the Lord of all religions. We counsel all to trustworthiness and godliness. In the great city the veil of trustworthiness was rent asunder; in place of the standard of justice, the banner of tyranny was raised. There befell this Wronged One that which hath been recorded in the book of the world. Be not grieved at the happenings of the world. The glance of loving-kindness hath been directed towards the men and women who have turned unto Him. Who can reckon His bounty and His bestowals? Some of the Hands of the Cause of God are present in that land. We send greetings to all and counsel them to love, fellowship and the betterment of affairs. We beseech God to sanctify the holy souls from vain imaginings, idle fancies, and the fanaticism of the former party. Verily, He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O Trustee! When thou arrivest there, make mention of the people of Baha on My behalf and convey My greetings to their faces by My command. We beseech God to protect them from the evil of every ignorant one and the oppression of every oppressor. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O My friends in Qaf and Mim! The Wronged One maketh mention of you at this hour. The deeds of My friends there have gained My acceptance and good-pleasure. Blessed are they and theirs shall be a goodly return. We testify that they have attained unto the sealed wine of My love and have drunk the Kawthar of My utterance from the hand of My bounty and the Salsabil of My remembrance from the cup of My grace. Upon them be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. We testify that the Trustee made mention of you time and again. We have made mention of you with a mention that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the utterance of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Ye are they whom the veils of glory have not withheld from the Self-Subsisting, and whom the oppression of every oppressor and the might of every remote transgressor did not frighten. It behooveth everyone to say, turning towards the Kaaba of God:</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O my God! Praise be unto Thee for having delivered me from the pit of heedlessness and vain desire, and guided me to Thy straight path and Thy mighty announcement, and aided me to turn toward Thee when most of Thy creatures turned away from Thee, and for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and my face with the radiance of Thy countenance. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace, to remove from the faces of Thy servants and creatures the veils that have prevented them from turning toward Thy most exalted horizon. O my Lord! Do not disappoint Thy servants from the ocean of Thy verses. By Thy glory! If Thou wert to unveil to them as Thou hast unveiled to me, they would cast away what they possess in hope of what is with Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O My friends in the cities and lands! The Trusted One hath mentioned you before Our face, and ye have attained unto the bounties of your Lord, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous. O My friends in all lands! Today the ocean of utterance hath another wave, and the Sun of grace another dawning. What hath come to pass that the people remain veiled from the gathering-place of the Concourse on High and barred from the Day-spring of the signs of the Lord of all beings? Hath there appeared in all creation aught like this Most Great Cause? Nay, by My Own Self, the Truth! All divine Books speak in praise and glorification thereof. O friends! Hearken unto His call, hold fast unto unity and concord, and aid the Cause of God, exalted be His glory, through the hosts of goodly deeds and praiseworthy character.</p>
<p>O people of God! Today the Blessed Tree hath no need of aught else to establish His Cause, for it hath appeared with countless sweet fruits, manifest and evident. Blessed is the one whom the doubts of the world have not prevented from turning to God nor held back from drawing nigh unto Him.</p>
<p>O Amin! Thou didst mention him that believeth and his wife, upon them be the glory of God. Let them carry out in the path of God that which they have purposed - it hath been accepted. Yet We leave it to themselves. Moreover, the reward of attaining His presence hath been recorded for each from the Most Exalted Pen. Happy are they both. The wife attained His presence in Baghdad. Now again her intention hath been adorned with the ornament of deed and accepted. O Amin! Thou seest that in the prison-land no place remaineth for anyone. Furthermore, for some time certain words have been spread abroad - the mischief-makers have suggested that which causeth harm to the friends. After this the matter resteth in the hand of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Muhammad Hasan, upon him be the glory of God, from Isfahan, as well as two other souls - Karbila’i Aqa Jan from Nur, and Muhammad Hasan from Isfahan, upon them both be the glory of God - and mention of their turning toward the Most Holy Court. The answer from the heaven of divine will is this: O Muhammad, before Hasan! The Trusted One hath mentioned thee before Our face, and what thou didst desire in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds. We beseech God to strengthen thee and assist thee in what He loveth and pleaseth, and to ordain for thee the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Know then that the idolaters have come between Us and Our loved ones. We ask God to record for thee the reward of attaining His presence. Verily He is the Lord of all being and the Lord of the mighty throne. By My life! My mention of thee equals not the remembrances of nations nor what the kings and rulers possess.</p>
<p>O Aqa Jan! Hear the call of the Wronged One. By the life of God, there hath befallen Him at the hands of the oppressor that which hath caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament. He Who possesseth the perspicuous Book beareth witness to this. My grief is not from Mine enemies, but from those who claim to love Me yet do what causeth My tears to flow and My heart and those with Me in this mighty prison to lament. The heedless one hath done there what hath caused hearts to lament and the veil of chastity and virtue to be rent, and the pillars of religion to quake at his deed. Blessed art thou for having been mentioned before the Wronged One and for this clear Book being sent down for thee. O Muhammad Hasan! Behold and then remember what hath befallen the trusted ones of God from the hosts of the oppressors. They denied their proofs and disputed their verses until they pronounced judgment against them without any evidence from God, the Lord of this exalted station. Say[…]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy path and given me to drink from the Kawthar of Thy utterance. I beseech Thee by the lights of the Orb of Thy proof to assist Thy servants in that which will diffuse the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure and attain the glory of Thy acceptance. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned to Thee, detached from all else but Thee. Ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy loved ones. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Thou didst make mention of Mir (Nabil-i-Qa’in). In truth he is a helper of the Cause and, to the extent of his capacity, mindful thereof. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid him with the hosts of grace, favors, wisdom and utterance, and to ordain for him that which will draw him nigh unto Him. Verily He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. His feast hath been accepted. In these days We have bidden them to perform that which Mir desired. O Amin! Verily grace hath encompassed all and bounty hath preceded all. The mention of each of the loved ones hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen in these days when grief hath surrounded all. We beseech God to send down upon His chosen ones from the heaven of His bounty a mercy from His presence. He is the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Amin! Make mention of the loved ones in the Land of ?a. The Hands of the Cause of God are, praise be to God, present and each standeth mentioned before the seat of the Wronged One. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to ’Ayn and Ba, and give them the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness and favor. Some time ago their petition attained the presence and was heard. Before and after the petition, answers were sent down from the heaven of divine bounty. As requested, his feast was accepted and achieved the glory of fulfillment. We beseech God to send down upon him at all times that which will gladden eyes and hearts. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those who have not broken God’s Covenant and Testament, who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of the earth and heavens.”</p>
<p>O Amin! Convey greetings from the Wronged One to ’Ali-Qabli-Haydar - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. Blessed be God, he standeth firm in service and is engaged in attending to the needs of the loved ones. We have ordained for him in Our Hidden Book that which none knoweth save God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Well is it with him and pleasant it is unto him.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the leaf, the daughter of Jim who ascended to the Supreme Horizon. This leaf turned to God from the beginning of the days and attained His acceptance. We bear witness that she turned with such steadfastness as was not shaken by the onslaught of the oppressors nor hindered by the veils of the transgressors. She drank the wine of immortality in My Most Great Name and attained that which was recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books, Psalms and Tablets. We have sent down for her that which shall endure as long as My utterance endureth in the kingdom of My knowledge. I am the Expositor, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We have desired to make mention of those with her as a grace and mercy from Our presence. I am the All-Generous.</p>
<p>O Siyyid Rida! He who loved Me made mention of thee. We make mention of thee through verses from which all who are endowed with perception can detect the fragrance of loving-kindness and favor. Verily the Letter calleth, the Word calleth, and the Tablet declareth before the Countenance of the Manifestation: “The One Who conversed on Sinai hath come!” Blessed are they who are endued with true understanding. O Rida! When thou drinkest the Salsabil of knowledge from the cup of thy Lord’s bounty, say:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having made me to acknowledge that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken, and to confess that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Signs and by the Finger of Thy Power whereby the veils of all creation were rent asunder, to make me steadfast in Thy love and firm in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We desire to make mention of thy son who hath been named Asadu’llah, that he may rejoice in the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of lords. All created things have borne witness to My remembrance of My loved ones, and all contingent beings to My turning toward My chosen ones. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid them and to ordain for them the reward of attaining My presence and standing before My face. He, verily, is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy other son who hath been named Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, and We give him the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all men. The Trusted One hath mentioned you purely for the sake of God. We have remembered you with that which no remembrance can equal. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me and guided me to the straight path. I beseech Thee to strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that the might of the ungodly shall not deter me.</p>
<p>O Rida! The glory from Us be upon thee and upon thy wife and thy children who have believed in God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Muhammad-Rida (of Muhammad-Abad), upon him be the glory of God. His mention hath been made in the divine Tablets, both in the past and present. Make mention of him on My behalf and adorn him with the ornament of My glorious and wondrous remembrance. O Muhammad-Qabli-Rida! Thou hast attained unto acceptance when most of mankind turned away, and thou hast drunk the choice wine of faith when the servants were debarred therefrom. Verily thy Lord remembereth him who remembereth Him, and loveth him who loveth Him. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Glorify thy Lord with praise in the nights and days with such glorification as will attract the inhabitants of the lands. He, verily, heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Trustee! Convey greetings and salutations from the Wronged One to the loved ones in every land, and remember each one with utmost love, kindness, joy and fragrance. His honor Mas’alih-Gu is, praise be to God, engaged in serving the Cause. We beseech God to open before his face the gates of grace and upon his tongue the gates of wisdom and utterance, that he may cause people to enter His religion, make them know His way, give them to drink of the Kawthar of His knowledge, and guide them to His Great Announcement. We were with him and heard what he spoke concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those who heard his call, his mention and his utterance in this wise Remembrance. In these days a Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of Will especially for him, and each of the names mentioned in his letter hath been blessed by the waves of the ocean of utterance of the Desired One of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Trustee! Make mention of the loved ones of the land of Qaf on behalf of the Wronged One - a mention whereby the world and all that are therein will remember. Say: O loved ones of God and His party! The call of the Wronged One is raised at all times. We beseech the Truth to aid each of His loved ones to that which is the cause of reformation and the means of success. It is hoped that each one may become manifest and evident as a standard in the remembrance of the Ancient King. O party of God! Be not saddened by the vicissitudes of the contingent world. If grief befalleth you in the path of God, you shall thereafter meet with the Most Great Joy and Supreme Gladness. This is a promise that shall not prove false, whereunto beareth witness He Who speaketh before all faces - God, there is no God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>He Who beareth My Name, Zayn, and likewise the Hand of the Cause of God in the Land of ?a, have made mention of the handmaidens of God and the Leaves in that land, and thou hast all been blessed with the effulgences of the Light of Divine Utterance. We beseech God to assist My loved ones and My Leaves to that which He loveth and is pleased with. The Leaf, who is an aunt, and the Leaves, and likewise the sons, have been and are mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. In truth, from the beginning of the Cause until now, they have been speaking in praise and remembrance and have been steadfast in service. Upon them be My glory and the glory of all who dwell in My Kingdom. The people of Kaf have ever been remembered at the Most Holy Court. Make thou happy, through divine favors, all those souls who have quaffed from the wine of steadfastness. The glory that shineth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who hearken unto thy words in this firm and irrefutable Cause.</p>
<p>=== END BH00133 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00134 ===</p>
<p>This is the City of Divine Unity - enter therein, O people of unity, that ye may be among those who receive with joy the glad-tidings of the Spirit. He is the Mighty, the Unique, the Exalted, the Most High, the Peerless.</p>
<p>These are the verses of the Book, whose signs have been detailed with matchless originality, free from all crookedness, as signs from God and as guidance, light and remembrance for all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. Therein is that which draweth men nigh unto the court of manifest holiness. Verily it is a Book wherein every wise decree is recorded, revealed in truth from the presence of One Who is All-Wise, All-Knowing. Therein is that which enricheth men beyond all things, and from it waft the sweet savors of holiness upon all creation, and it singeth that there is no God but Him. He doeth what He willeth by His command and decreeth what He pleaseth. Say: Verily therein is that which illumineth the breasts, and therein is detailed all things from God, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and verily He is the Ever-Living in the kingdom of eternity. He ordaineth what He pleaseth and is not asked of what He willeth. Within His grasp is the dominion of creation. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>He, verily, is the Truth. There is no God but Him. He hath ever been sanctified beyond all else and exalted above the description of aught else besides Him. None hath preceded Him in knowledge and He encompasseth all things. None of His creation hath ever been associated with the knowledge of His Essence, nor can any assured one attain unto His recognition, nor any soul know Him, for He is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Wise. He hath been One in His Essence, One in His attributes, and One in His acts. He hath ever been alone on the throne of grandeur, and will forever remain single upon the seat of glory. He is the Eternal unto Whom nothing can go forth and with Whom nothing can be joined. He is the Most High, the Omnipotent, the Great.</p>
<p>None hath understood His oneness save His Own Self, and none hath known Him except His Own Being. All that hath been created in the realm of origination and brought into being in the kingdom of invention was created by a word of His command. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bountiful. That which the mystics know in their loftiest stations, and that which the accomplished ones attain in their highest ranks, is but the recognition of a sign of His revelation unto itself by itself, and this is the ultimate knowledge - if ye be of them that understand. When the doors of attainment unto His Eternal Essence were closed, and the wings of understanding were prevented from soaring into the kingdom of His command, He sent forth the Messengers from His presence and revealed unto them the Books from His side, and made their knowledge the knowledge of His Self. This was accepted from all created things as a token of His grace and a bounty from His presence unto all in the realm. Whoso acknowledgeth them hath acknowledged God and confessed His unity, and whoso draweth nigh unto them hath drawn nigh unto the court of manifest holiness, and whoso obeyeth them hath obeyed God, and whoso turneth away from them hath turned away from the face of God, the Mighty, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Living, the Most High.</p>
<p>God hath ordained the knowledge of Himself to consist in the knowledge of these Souls, and this is what was decreed in the tablets of the Command from the presence of One Mighty, Powerful. This is the ultimate station of the mystics in their highest ascent, were ye of them that know. God hath not ordained for anyone a portion beyond this, nor is there for any soul a way unto it. This is what the Truth hath prescribed for Himself, were ye of them that understand. Can the weak ascend unto One Who is All-Powerful, Ancient? Say: Glory be unto God! All are poor before Him.</p>
<p>This is what He hath prescribed for Himself, the Truth, if ye be of them that know. Can the weak ascend unto the Ancient and All-Powerful? Say: Glory be to God! All are poor before Him, and all are powerless to know Him. Doth it befit the mortal to soar in the dominion of the Immortal? Say: Glory be to God! All are helpless before Him, and all are bewildered at the manifestations of His Cause.</p>
<p>And thou, O Salman, bear witness in thy soul, thy spirit, thy tongue and all thy members that there is none other God but Him, and that all are His servants and all are His worshippers. Then, O Salman, submit thyself to God’s command and to that which thou art bidden in the Book, and be not of the heedless. Then know thou the worth of these days and forget not the grace bestowed upon thee, and be of the thankful. Then detach thyself from thy self and thy desires, that God may inspire thee through His grace with that which shall deliver thee from all the worlds. Beware lest thou deprive thyself of the breezes of this Spirit, for this indeed would be a manifest loss.</p>
<p>Then draw nigh with all thy being unto God, the King, the Ever-Living, the Almighty, the Ancient. Say: This is a season from among God’s seasons which hath appeared through grace, and naught in the heavens or on earth can alter it. Say: By God! This is the springtime which hath adorned Paradise with its beauty, and no autumn shall ever follow it throughout all eternity. And verily this is a season unprecedented on earth, for it abideth under the shadow of One exalted and mighty.</p>
<p>O concourse of Paradise! Take your portion of this breeze whereby the temples of all the worlds have been renewed, and wherein the spirit of the Living, the Self-Subsisting was breathed into decayed bones. O ye who dwell in the depths of oneness! Detach yourselves from your own knowledge and from all whereby ye have recognized your Creator, and unite with God in these days according to what He hath detailed unto you in truth, and be not of the heedless. Then take your share in this season wherein all things are dyed with the hue of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O concourse of immortality! Detach yourselves from all that ye have taken unto yourselves, then turn ye unto the Ridvan which hath been opened in the name of God, the Most High, in a holy and wondrous mystery. O ye who dwell in the heavens! Glorify God in the name of Him through Whom the letter Kaf was joined to its pillar, the Ra and the Mim. Then hearken unto the melodies of the Spirit from this Bird that singeth in all modes at every moment.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! By God, this is the Dove that remembereth you with the most excellent remembrance, that ye may be of them who remember. He desireth naught from you, nor will He ever desire any recompense. His recompense is but to be martyred for the love of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: By God! Whoso seeketh not for himself what I have mentioned in truth is indeed in manifest loss. Say: Those who flee from death in God’s path are in doubt concerning the meeting with God - these are the heedless ones. These have not inhaled the fragrances of holiness from this luminous Garment, and have slept upon the couch of heedlessness, turning away from that which is best for them in the kingdom of the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Say: Soon will God roll up the earth and all that is therein, and will gather you in truth unto a sacred and mighty dwelling. Then shall ye witness the mysteries of the Cause and become aware of that which hath been ordained by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And ye shall say within yourselves: “Oh, woe unto us for what we have neglected in remembrance of God, and indeed we were among those in manifest error!” By God! Were the veil to be lifted from before the eyes of the servants, and were they to behold what their hands have wrought in the days of God, their spirits would depart from their bodies. This is the truth certain.</p>
<p>And verily thou, O Salman, take counsel in what We have counseled thee through grace and commanded thee through justice, and be not of them that slumber. Then remind thyself and the souls of the servants concerning that which We have sent down unto thee in truth, that perchance the people may turn with their hearts to a seat of glorious honor.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast asked concerning the verse of unity and the word of detachment, know thou that this is beyond my station, and I am but a lowly servant. He it is in Whose hand is the kingdom of knowledge and in Whose grasp is the dominion of wisdom. He teacheth whom He willeth whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful. His is the command over all who are in the heavens and on earth. He doeth what He willeth, and He is the King, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful. Nothing escapeth His knowledge and nothing frustrateth Him. He shall not be questioned as to that which He doeth, and He is the Prevailer, the Subduer, the Exalted, the Most High.</p>
<p>But I, despite my weakness, my affliction, my poverty and my need, when I find in myself the desire to manifest that which God hath given me through His grace, lest I be of those of whom God hath said in His preserved and mighty Book - and His word is the truth - “Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on others and hide what God hath given them of His grace,” therefore do I impart unto thee what God causeth to flow from My pen, that thou mayest glory in that which We have specially conferred upon thee amongst all people, and that thou mayest be of the detached ones, and that thou mayest thank God for what He hath bestowed upon thee through His grace, and hath sent down unto thee verses at which the mystics are bewildered.</p>
<p>Know thou then and understand that unity hath diverse ranks, realms and stations which none knoweth and none hath reckoned save God, the King, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Glorious. And were I to explain to thee in this station what God hath taught me through His grace, the Tablets would not suffice, nor would the seas, were they to be made ink for these holy, transcendent, mighty and gracious words. For God’s outpouring hath no cessation and His command no delay. He it is Who hath detailed from the Primal Point the knowledge of what was and what will be, if ye be of them that know. And He will detail in the manner of this Point sciences which no ear hath heard and none of the world’s people shall ever know.</p>
<p>Say: Should He desire to roll up all the sciences that have been expounded in creation since the beginning that hath no beginning, verily He is able, and this would be easier than the twinkling of an eye. There is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful. He it is in Whose grasp is the kingdom of the knowledge of the heavens and earth. He eraseth what He willeth by His command and confirmeth what He desireth by His power, and with Him is a preserved and holy Tablet.</p>
<p>Say: He it is Who hath ever been sanctified above all that ye know, and in every matter He cometh with a wondrous knowledge. Say: The essences of unity and limitation are equal in His sight, but most people lie sleeping upon the couch of ignorance. Say: Were He to erase the signs of unity and decree limitation, this would be a manifest truth, and none may say “why” or “wherefore,” for the command is what appeareth from His presence and the decree is what He ordaineth, and He is the Strong, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Therefore testify, O Salman, within thyself that in God’s treasuries are sciences before a single letter of which the knowledge of none can be mentioned, nor the unity wherewith His servants unify God, nor the highest essences of detachment. But since His mercy hath preceded all creatures, He accepteth from them what He commandeth them in the time of every Messenger and the era of every Prophet, as a grace from His presence unto all created things.</p>
<p>Bear thou witness that there is no God but Him. None can know Him […]</p>
<p>And through His grace, He made the Covenant of every Prophet binding upon all created things. I bear witness that there is none other God but Him. No one hath known Him, nor can any soul attain unto the wonders of His knowledge, nor can any among those in His dominion comprehend Him, if ye be of them that perceive the mysteries of the Cause. Would that there were sanctified doves and detached hearts that might soar with this servant in the atmosphere of this knowledge, by whose proximity the wings of them that are nigh unto God have been consumed. Erelong will God raise up in the earth such servants as will not be held back by the hindrance of them that are shut out, who will soar on the wing of holiness, and journey through the realms of eternity, and enter beneath the pavilion of resplendent glory. No earthly affair shall occupy them, nor shall the ornaments of the world distract them from the remembrance of God, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the Glorious. And when they hear the melodies of the Spirit, their eyes overflow with tears, and they rejoice in the Spirit of God, and turn unto the Beauty of ancient holiness. They would not exchange the signs of God for aught else, even were all who are in the heavens and on earth to expend their all. And whenever they hear the melodies of God, they incline toward the homeland of nearness and offer up their souls at every moment. At this point, it behooveth Me to begin mention of that which I intended before, and conclude this remembrance which no mind, however lofty, can comprehend.</p>
<p>Know, O Salman, that We bear witness, in the station of the unity of the Divine Essence, that He is One in His Essence, and hath ever been seated upon the throne of unity and the seat of singleness. There was none with Him, nor shall any be mentioned before Him. He is the Everlasting, the Self-Subsisting, the Mighty, the Gracious. He hath ever existed in the sovereignty of His Essence, and with Him there was neither mention of aught, nor knowledge of any soul, nor unity of any being. And now He is as He was in the eternity of eternities–there is no God but Him, the Peerless, the All-Wise. Far beyond this station is the knowledge of the knowers and the attainment of the attainers, for all else is non-existent before Him, null in His presence, and brought into being by His command. His is the command and the creation, and He is aware of all things. He is God; there is no God but Him, Who hath taken unto Himself no guardian, nor helper, nor partner, nor likeness, nor minister. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Encompassing.</p>
<p>We further bear witness that He is One in His attributes, and all attributes are severed from His holy court. This is what He hath ordained for Himself, if ye be of them that know. Know thou that the multiplicities of the worlds of attributes and names can never be associated with His Essence, for His attributes, exalted be He, are identical with His Essence, and none shall ever know how this is save Him. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Forgiving, the Merciful. All these names and attributes return unto His Prophets and Messengers and chosen ones, for they are the mirrors of His attributes and the dawning-places of His names. Otherwise, He, exalted be He, is hidden in His Essence and attributes, and all these manifest themselves in His Prophets through His most excellent names and most exalted attributes, lest any soul be deprived of the knowledge of the attributes in the heaven of names. This, verily, is a bounty from Him unto all worlds.</p>
<p>The upholder of unity hath, in this station, the right to be convinced that the manifestation of these attributes in God’s Messengers is none other than His attributes, exalted be He, such that no difference can be seen between Him and them, except that their attributes appeared by His command and were created by His will. This is the true unity in this station, which We have bestowed upon you through grace, that ye may be of them that are firmly rooted. The knower shall witness nothing, either in the heavens or on earth, except that he seeth God standing over it, and everything testifieth with the tongue of its inner reality that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Great. The knower ascendeth unto a station wherein he witnesseth the signs of God’s revelation in all things, such that were the lights of this revelation to be withdrawn from contingent beings, nothing would remain in the kingdom. Thereby is it established that He was, and there was nothing else besides Him. Glorified and exalted be He above what these polytheists say.</p>
<p>The upholder of unity hath the right not to differentiate between the words of God, and to testify by his own essence and self that all verses have been sent down from Him, and whatsoever was revealed unto the Messengers is truth wherein there is no doubt, and hath been detailed from God, the Protector, the Mighty. All religious laws have been detailed from a single point and ordained by God, and unto Him do they return, and there is no difference between them, if ye be of them that are certain. Despite their differences in every age and era, there is no difference among them, for they all appeared through God’s command.</p>
<p>And there is no difference in the ages, for they have all appeared through God’s Cause, and the Cause is one from all eternity. This is what hath been inscribed by the luminous and holy Pen. Beware, O people of unity, lest ye make any distinction between the Manifestations of God’s Cause or in what hath been revealed unto them of verses - this is true unity, if ye be of those who are certain. Likewise in their deeds and acts and whatsoever hath appeared and will appear from them - all is from God and all act by His command. Whoso maketh any distinction between them, or between their words, or what hath been revealed unto them, or in their conditions and deeds, even to the smallest degree, hath indeed associated partners with God and His signs and His Messengers, and is counted among the polytheists. Thus do We teach you the ways of knowledge and wisdom, that ye may perchance enter within the pavilions of glory. All that We have mentioned concerning unity between them, and concerning the gems of oneness and the realities of singleness, pertaineth only to the station of revelation, for they all began from God and will return unto Him, and they judged by His command and spoke by His leave. Therefore the decree of unity is established for them in this station. Thus do We expound the verses unto you that ye may be of those who are certain. However, in the station of distinction, God hath preferred some above others, as the master is preferred above the servants. In this station, behold the station of some as the Point above the letters, and just as the letters are derived from the Point and revolve around it, likewise know thou the ranks of the Prophets. And We bear witness that He Who came unto you by the name of ’Ali is the Point, around which revolve the spirits of the Messengers. Therefore say within thyself: “Blessed be God, the best of creators!” And We bear witness in the station of deeds that all appeared by His command and were created by His word and were sent forth by His decree, and return to the station which He hath ordained for them. That is God, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. Can anyone move in the kingdom contrary to what God hath decreed in the Book? Say: Glory be to God! All things move by His command and all return unto Him. There is no God but Him. He taketh what He willeth from whom He willeth and ordaineth for all things what He desireth. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. There is nothing but His knowledge encompasseth it before its appearance and after its appearance, and He hath ordained for it what is best for it above all that is in the heavens and the earth. This is what hath been inscribed by the Pen of the Wise, the Ancient.</p>
<p>Beware, O people of the Bayan, lest ye be confounded regarding the deeds that flow from Him and how He punisheth His sinful servants in the depths of hell. Know ye that the Exalted One hath in truth sent forth the Messengers to bid men to righteousness and piety, to forbid them from transgression and wickedness, and to give them glad tidings of the meeting with God on the Day when light shall shine forth from a seat of transcendent glory. This hath He irrevocably decreed for all the worlds. Through them hath God made known the paths of guidance and error, and hath clarified by the tongue of His Messengers all that He hath willed for them, such that no good thing remaineth unmentioned in a perspicuous Book. When He had made manifest the truth unto them and had illumined the holy paths and revealed the ways of paradise, He commanded them to do all that would bring them nigh unto these sacred stations and draw them closer to God, the Mighty, the Praised. He forbade them whatsoever would harm them, and thus He raiseth the obedient to the canopy of nearness and casteth down the proud. Then He gave them choice between these two paths after they had gained knowledge and recognition of the ways of guidance and error, and He assisteth them in whatsoever they choose for themselves. This is His justice towards all who dwell in His dominion. Therefore bear thou witness within thyself that God hath never wronged any soul by so much as a grain of mustard seed, nor will He ever do so. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Bountiful, the Generous. When the paths of truth have been distinguished from falsehood for the servants, and the ways of guidance from error, He prospereth them in whatsoever they desire and His decree floweth according to their wishes. Thus do We expound the verses unto you and impart words of wisdom that your hearts and the hearts of them that are nigh may rejoice therein. Were He, the Exalted One, to withhold His servants from one deed and compel them to another, this would be an injustice on His part. Glorified and exalted is He above wronging any soul by so much as the husk of a date stone. After His power over all things and the flowing of His decree through all things, He assisteth all created things in their deeds after they have recognized light from darkness. This is of His grace, could ye but perceive with the eye of wisdom the mysteries of His Cause. Whosoever saith other than what We have inspired in thee, or speaketh other than what We have imparted unto thee, is indeed a transgressor by the clear text of the Book. God is quit of him, unless he repenteth and returneth unto God and becometh of them that seek forgiveness. He forgiveth whom He willeth and chastiseth whom He willeth, He giveth unto whom He pleaseth and withholdeth from whom He pleaseth. He shall not be questioned about that which He doeth. In His hand is the kingdom of creation and command, and within His grasp is the empire of the heavens and earth. He giveth life and causeth death, then causeth death and giveth life, and He, verily, is the Ever-Living Who dieth not. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, His grace encompasseth all created things, His mercy hath preceded all beings, and He knoweth the treachery of hearts and whatsoever appeareth therefrom. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the Mighty, the Ruler, the Kind, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Know then, O people of the Bayan, that God desireth for His servants naught save that which will draw them to the supreme pavilions in the heaven of eternity. He hath ordained for them only that which will deliver them from self and passion, that sovereignty may remain with Him, the True One, and that He may purify the earth and all that dwell thereon from the defilement of these idolaters. We testify, regarding the station of the unity of worship, that all returneth unto God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing. All hath appeared from a single Command from the presence of the Wise, the Ancient. All began from God and will return unto Him, and all are returning unto Him. Unto Him, by God, ascendeth the goodly word, and all bow down before His countenance. All in the heavens and earth worship Him, and there is nothing that doth not glorify Him with praise and fear His might. There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. All necks are humbled before His sovereignty, all hearts are submissive to His command and mindful of His remembrance. He it is Whom all things worship, and Whom all in the heavens and earth do serve. Verily, they who are established upon the throne of unity and the seats of oneness witness within themselves that all wherewith the servants worship their Creator in their cloisters and mosques hath been sent down from God and returneth unto Him, for the Object of worship is one, glorified and exalted be He. We are all His worshippers, even though the servants be heedless in their worship and forget their Creator. Yet the very acts of worship and remembrance themselves hasten unto their Creator and Fashioner, and all are hastening unto Him. All that ye witness of the religions of the earth, their worship and their remembrance, all was detailed by God in the age of His Messengers and ambassadors, and all worship by His command. But when they were veiled from […] and none shall soar in its atmosphere to the highest knowledge of the mystics save whom thy Lord willeth. Well is it with him whose eyes are solaced in this Day by the meeting with God, the King, the Most Exalted, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the East and West! These indeed are melodies mentioned by the Ha at the time when it passed through the valley of glory in the Sinai of the Spirit, that spot wherein naught is mentioned save God, the Mighty, the Gracious. And when it arrived therein it took the letter Sin from the first valley through the love that connected them in the world of pre-existence. Then appeared the assembled letters in the worlds of names by the command of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: This indeed is a city wherein if the sick enter they are healed and made whole more swiftly than the name of the moment can pass over the tongue. Were the kingdom of names to pass by it, they would all become bones and all would speak of God, such that by one name thereof all who are in the heavens and earth would be transformed. And thou, O Salman, strive within thyself to enter this city. If thou art unable to enter, then seek with thy spirit; perchance thou mightst pass around it and be touched by the breezes that emanate therefrom. By God, this is better for thee than the kingdom of the first and the last ones. This is My command unto thee and unto those who have ascended to the seat of a manifest sovereign. And when thou enterest the land of Sad, remind the letter Za with holy, sublime remembrances. Say: Hearken unto what the Dove of Holiness singeth unto thee when it soareth from atmosphere to atmosphere of sublime glory. Be not troubled by this, for therein lie the secrets of the Command, if thou art of those who possess insight. Trust in God in thy affair, fear no one, and be not of the fearful. This is what We informed thee of before in preserved holy tablets. Turn with thy face and heart unto God, the King […] and praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>[In the holy Tablet, opposite the words “glad-tidings”, “eternity” and “the Cause” which are marked with brackets and taken from the margin of the book, the words “glad-tidings”, “the Bayan” and “knowledge” are respectively inscribed]</p>
<p>=== END BH00134 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00135 ===</p>
<p>This is what was sent down from the heaven of will for the one who asked about the verse revealed in the Best of Stories [Ahsanu’l-Qisas]. O Apple of Mine Eye! Strike thou upon the people of the city with two strikes upon two souls. God hath ordained for one of them two gardens with tall trees around the Gate, one watering the pools with water and the other drinking water from two cups. And they were, by God’s leave, stationed around the fire in two waters. And for the other were two rivers in the land of the two wests, and he had fishes in one of the two gulfs. He said to his first companion: “Ye two are in command in the latter times, and I do not think the Truth will remain standing in the two hours.” Thus he showed certain disbelief towards his own self and the two souls after him. By God the Truth! Judge ye with justice - which of the two souls in the two parties was praiseworthy around the fire?</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Ancient, the Most Great, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book from Us to him who hath believed in God and His sovereignty which hath encompassed the worlds, that the Wronged One might make mention of him who was abandoned in the hands of those who were deprived of the fragrances of revelation, and who arose to serve Him among His creatures in such wise as was adorned with the ornament of glory. The afflictions and calamities and tribulations have surrounded Us from people who were despairing of the spirit of the All-Merciful. In the evening We see the oppressors issuing one decree, and in the morning another - thus was the fire visible from the horizon of tyranny through injustice. They have forbidden the loved ones from standing before the Gate and from showing humility before the Celestial Might which was raised through the power of the Divine Realm. Would the phoenix shrink from the fire? Nay, by the Self of the Chosen One! But the wicked are in a station far removed from nearness. Say: I am the phoenix in this scene and tribulation is My fire, and verily it is the light of truth among creation - thus hath the rain of revelation been sent down in truth from the heaven of utterance. I would not exchange this tribulation for all that is in the world, nor this abasement for glory that exists among the worlds. We have heard thy call and answered thee with this melody whereby rapture hath seized the dwellers of the realms of names and the dewdrops of grace have taken hold of all in the kingdom. By My life! When the tongue of the All-Merciful was loosed, the Point of the Bayan turned to hear the melodies that were raised from the direction of the Throne. Blessed is he who hath been intoxicated by the wine of utterance from the cup of glory and hath been moved by this fragrance that was sent from the garment of Beauty through grace. Give thanks for the breezes of the All-Merciful that have wafted upon thee from the Lord of Religions, and thou wast mentioned before the Countenance by the Pen of Justice through grace. All that exists in creation cannot equal this Tablet - to this doth testify the Lord of Invention while abandoned in prison. Rejoice thou in My joy, and be steadfast in My Cause, and gaze toward My horizon, and soar in the atmosphere of My love, and speak forth My Name which hath been the Self-Subsisting over the worlds.</p>
<p>And concerning what thou hast asked about the two verses, know that We have set forth from the Most Exalted Pen for the people of the City of Eternity the sweetest of parables concerning two souls. One of them drank what was upon the established Throne, whereon were the two luminous Lights shining from two horizons, sustained by two springs branching from two mighty oceans flowing from the letter “Ha” standing between two letters. Verily, he was the one manifest in the letter “Ba” before the two letters, and he stood before the Ba which shone with two ornaments upon the truth by the truth. Say: Verily the first Ba bore what the eight bore, detached from all creation. And around the shrine’s gate were two gardens in recognition of two pre-existing Names, adorned with two lofty trees in the mystery manifest in two commands. And We ordained for each of them from the water flowing from two directions of the Throne, whereon was established the confluence of two seas from two Names, a measure decreed by God. When the life of the world was attached to it, it was called water, and when the veils of glory were consumed by it, it was called fire. Thus was the water visible from the horizon of light upon the truth by the truth. It has names which none can count save him who possesses the Book inscribed by the Finger of Might. When they acknowledged the Seat of Command and gave glad tidings to all lands of the Lord of Creation, We caused them to speak the mysteries concealed in the scrolls of grandeur and stationed them by grace around the Fire of the Word in two stations. And upon the other were two rivers at the setting of two moons according to those who perceive between two worlds. He possessed knowledge of one of the Names and acknowledged the first two who recognized the ultimate goal and the end of the six made manifest by the letter Vav through the standing of Alif between two Vavs. He said: “Ye are upon the truth, but I think not that the two hours after them shall come to pass.” Thus was the matter decreed in the Tablets by God’s Pen in truth. Thou art apart from the other and his denial. Consider then the latter one who, when he saw around him souls associating partners with God, ablaze with the fire kindled from the Zaqqum tree, grew proud against God and denied the Hour which the Hour itself proclaimed, by which the Tree spoke, the Rock cried out, the Dove sang, and all things called out: “The Kingdom belongeth to Him Who hath come with the truth with an authority that encompasseth all worlds!” Thus did We inform thee concerning this latter one through Our words in the Qayyumu’l-Asma: “Verily thy Lord is knowing of all things.” We said: “O Joseph, O Most Great Gate! Turn away from this tree planted in falsehood at the Gate.” Behold then what We foretold the servants in the Book, then those who turned away following their desires and stood disputing in the wilderness of error. Reflect upon the two hours and their mysteries and what was sent down to them from the heaven of Command, that thou mayest find thyself possessed of knowledge and become strong in God’s religion upon the truth by the truth. The Lord of Eternity calleth out through the Pen of His Most Great Name: “By God! Whoso denieth it is assuredly in manifest unbelief,” like unto those souls and the two who denied thereafter. Thus hath the ocean of eternity sprinkled upon thee that thou mayest arise with His authority to serve Him and with His Name to mention Him, that perchance the people may be awakened by the fragrances wafted from the direction of the Garment unto all worlds. O thou who art illumined by the lights of thy Lord’s countenance, the Most Merciful, and who soarest in the atmosphere of remembrance and utterance! Shouldst thou inhale the two fragrances diffusing from the two crimson ornaments suspended between the heaven of Will raised by two symbols and the earth spread out by two names, it would draw thee to a station wherein thou wouldst abandon all contingent things[…]</p>
<p>O Earth, spread forth by the Two Names, so as to draw thee unto a station where thou shalt forsake the realm of contingent being with all its idle fancies, and shalt speak forth amidst the people of power with this Remembrance, whereby the Most Great Balance hath appeared betwixt the two worlds among the peoples of both realms, and God’s decree hath shone forth in both cycles. Thus hath the Sun of Utterance been witnessed from the horizon of the All-Merciful through grace. Then do We strike for thee, through favor, a similitude of the two cords: one of fine twisted silk wrought by the two most powerful fingers of the Two Most Great Names, and the other woven of spider’s web, fashioned of two imaginary names. Which of these is more secure among the peoples? Say: Consider, O people, and follow not those who have denied the All-Merciful when He came with clear proof, and who through their own desires were debarred from the horizon of guidance through ignorance. Say: He Who spoke forth the Qayyumu’l-Asma desired naught but to mention what existed among the people, lest those who hesitated in the allusions of their own idle fancies should flee, and that they might turn instead toward a station which hath ever been, in the eternity of eternities, praiseworthy in truth. By My life! Were it not for mankind’s weakness, He would not have uttered a single word of the tales recounted aforetime. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things, and God is witness to what I say. All books return unto the First Name, and verily unto this station which hath been sanctified above all description. We have desired to speak in another strain - verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. O Pen of Glory! Wouldst thou desire to move upon similitudes when the lights of Beauty are manifest? Nay, by thy Self, O Exalted One! I desire naught save to make mention of Thyself amidst all created things, and to this Thy Self, transcendent above all opposites, doth testify. What I have mentioned of similitudes was solely for love of him who turned to Thee and asked Thee concerning what was revealed in the Tablets. I moved but between the fingers of Thy power by Thy command, and Thou didst cause me to speak forth what Thou hast made today the water of reunion for the people of Baha and the wine of immortality for Thy chosen servants.</p>
<p>O Lion! Arise through My love, then give the unitarians to drink of this sealed nectar through My Name, the Self-Subsisting, in such wise that the dead shall arise. Beware lest allusions hold thee back from what thou hast been commanded by the Revealer of verses. Arise and say: O people! The Dawning-Place of Revelation hath come with majesty and power. O Dawning-Place of Eternity in this Most Great Ornament! Set forth the verses in another style. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest through Thy word “Be” and it is. Then make mention of him who desired Thy remembrance, that the attraction of utterance might draw him unto God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed art thou in that thou hast attained unto the days of God and hast turned unto a Cause whereby wealth was seized and souls perished. Whoso acknowledgeth the Ultimate Goal in such days when the breezes of might pass behind the veils is the solace of all existence. Blessed is he who hath attained unto God’s triumph when the Face was rejected by every idolater. Hold fast unto the Most Firm, Most Perfect Cord, and speak forth among the peoples that which the Beauty of the Ancient of Days hath spoken on this Promised Day. By My life! Should they discover the fragrance of My utterance, they would detach themselves from all else, soar in My atmosphere, and aid this Hidden Name. Say: By His Name, the Self-Subsisting! He is indeed the Hidden One, though He speaketh among men and uttereth speech at eventide and at dawn. Thus have We adorned thy temple with the ornament of utterance and thy heart with this treasured Remembrance. Be thou thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of the seen and the unseen!</p>
<p>Praise, sanctified from the limitations of created things and exalted above the doubts of all beings, befitteth the most holy, most exalted, most inaccessible court of the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and unseen, Who, through His irrevocable decree, ordained the Pen of Command to be the source of ancient mysteries and the fountain of life for all the peoples of the world, that all nations might attain unto eternal, everlasting life. That life-giving water appeared in the form of the Word among creation and shone forth through a single effulgence, and that effulgence was manifested according to the diversity of mirrors in the forms of mirrors. That Word is the Primal Form into which the Divine Spirit breathed the Merciful Spirit, whereby He took hold of all spirits and bestowed upon them a new spirit. In some mirrors it appeared in the form and effect of light, and He guided it to the Dayspring of revelation; and in others it appeared in the form of fire, and He caused it to return to the evil dwelling place which is the abode of the wicked. This blessed Primal Word hath been called by all names - in one place as the Trumpet, in another as the Bugle, and likewise as the Path, the Balance, and the like. It is the cause of the gathering and resurrection of all things whatsoever that have been created in earth and heaven. Through it was manifested all that hath been sent down in the Book concerning the Hour and its signs, and the Resurrection and what shall appear therein. In one station it cannot be described by any description nor mentioned by any mention, while in another station it is described by the most exalted attributes and mentioned by the most beautiful names. Verily it is the Primal Will which created itself by itself and created through itself all else besides it.</p>
<p>And afterward, answers to your questions - some regarding the verses revealed in the Qayyumu’l-Asma - were sent down in a most wondrous manner, were you to know. And some others were revealed from the Source of the Cause and Dawning-Place of Revelation as God hath willed, in the Persian tongue, that your eyes might be consoled thereby and your heart rejoiced. However, due to the discord, upheaval and turbulence in this land, brevity hath been and is observed. We beseech God to make it a light unto the righteous and a fire unto the wicked. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is known to you that the commentary on Ahsanu’l-Qisas was revealed according to the people’s understanding. This was due to pure grace, that perchance the heedless and ignorant might ascend to the heaven of knowledge. Indeed, most of the subjects mentioned therein were matters already established among the followers of the Furqan. Had it been revealed from the beginning according to what God intended, none would have accepted it or remained steadfast. All this was of His grace unto His creation and His bounty unto His servants.</p>
<p>Observe how in the beginning of the Cause, His Holiness manifested Himself as the Bab. This was because in those days the birds of men’s hearts were incapable of soaring beyond that station. All things lamented that He associated Himself with this station, for were this station His true and original one - while that which is above it and above that which is above it is created by a word from Him and a gesture from His finger - people would forever remain submerged in the ocean of idle fancies and veiled from what God intended, save whom God rescueth through His grace and acquainteth with what He hath manifested through His Command.</p>
<p>Consider the most exalted, most holy station which encompasses the verse “He begetteth not, nor is He begotten, and there is none like unto Him,” while the Point of the Bayan, addressing Him, saith: “O Most Great Master! I would sacrifice my all for Thee and desire naught but martyrdom in Thy path.” What accusations they have made and what harm they have inflicted, even though, were they fair, they would testify that in this Revelation there hath appeared outwardly what appeared not in any previous Revelation.</p>
<p>Thus, after countless afflictions and imprisonment in the Most Great Prison, while all doors were outwardly shut and We were at the mercy of the oppressors, We proclaimed the Cause to all the kings of the earth with utmost clarity and without concealment. Thou hast heard the wondrous Call and witnessed in those regions the signs of His oppression through what befell the servants. God seized them first for following the Tree of Tyranny, for through them the oppressor gained strength in every age. Then He seized the branch that appeared in the image of the root, with justice. Thus was it revealed aforetime in various tablets. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, thou seest how some among the people of the Bayan have closed their eyes to justice and risen in tyranny. They know not what they say, in what valley they wander, or to what rope they cling. Strange it is that they count themselves among the faithful, while the faith of none can be established except through acceptance of what hath been manifested in this Revelation, even if it be contrary to what they possess. For instance, were He to declare that this leaf before the Divine Throne is the Dawning-Place of His Most Beautiful Names […]</p>
<p>Now verily no one’s faith can be established save through certitude in whatsoever hath been manifested in this Revelation, even if it be contrary to that which they possess. For instance, if He should declare this leaf - the royal rose which now existeth before the Divine Throne - to be the Dawning-place of the Most Beautiful Names and the Dayspring of the Most Exalted Attributes, or vice versa, and should any soul fail to believe or hesitate, such a one hath not believed in God and is excluded from faith. For the Tree speaketh through its root, and His Revelation shineth forth from His horizon. All have been and shall continue to be adorned with the ornament of faith through belief in God, which is the essence of believing in Him, and without it they are unmentioned. From this utterance which hath shone forth from the horizon of the knowledge of the All-Merciful, one can observe the kingdom of names in commotion. Ponder thou carefully that thou mayest attain unto the purpose of God - meaning that the temples adorned with the ornament of the glory of names are seen to be disturbed, for they who are seated upon the thrones of names have no abode or dwelling place except through the command of the Lord of Power. Should the Sun of Purpose shine forth from the heaven of this utterance upon thy heart, infinite doors would be opened and no mention would prevent man from the Most Sublime Vision. The idols have been shattered by the hands of power and the veils have been burnt by the fire of attraction, and sovereignty remaineth unto God alone, alone. Blessed are they who possess understanding. This is a realm that hath been and shall ever be sanctified from the taint of peer, equal, opposite, likeness or similitude. Know thou the melody of utterance and be of the thankful ones. Today all must fix their gaze upon that which appeareth in this Revelation, not upon that which they possess. Whoso faileth to attain unto this station shall not attain unto the recognition of Him Who is the Manifestation of His Own Self. The cause of some followers of the Bayan being deprived of the ocean of the mercy of the All-Merciful are those vain imaginings which are deemed authentic by the people of the Furqan. Yet ye have witnessed that whatsoever was in their possession was not mentioned in the sight of God. They have not drunk a drop from the ocean of knowledge nor attained unto a single letter of the knowledge of the Book. And since the people are seen to be weak and veiled, the Sun of Truth, as a favor unto them, occupieth Itself with the mention of an atom, and the Ancient Ocean speaketh of a drop. This is why the Primal Point appeared with the name of “Gate”, yet even with this measure the people were not content, let alone mention of Guardianship and the like. And yet all these stations and above them have been brought into being through a single word from the ocean of His bounty and shall cease to exist through a single command. In this connection the Exalted One hath mentioned in the Persian Bayan a saying of Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsa’i, upon him be the glory of God, when someone asked him about a word which the Qa’im would utter and which the three hundred and thirteen souls who would be among the most God-fearing and distinguished ones of that Revelation would be unable to bear. The honored Shaykh refused to mention that word and said: “Verily thou art unable to bear it.” After insistence he said: “If the Qa’im should bid thee to renounce the successorship of the Commander of the Faithful, would you do so?” He immediately refused, saying “God forbid!” And the Point declareth in this connection that it is evident to the people of truth that the honored Shaykh caused him to hear that word from the tongue of the Qa’im, and when he could not bear it he became an unbeliever, though he realized it not.</p>
<p>I swear by the Sun of Eternity that shineth from the Most Great Prison: should anyone ponder upon this utterance, detached from all imitation and vain imaginings, he would become aware of the greatness of this Cause, and no mention would veil him from this Most Great Remembrance that speaketh amongst the peoples. O thou who gazest! The Truth is present and declareth: Now ponder and observe in what station of loftiness, exaltation, sublimity, and transcendent glory this Cause dwelleth, while the people stand confined within their own limitations. He hath taken unto Himself neither partner, nor likeness, nor peer, nor minister, nor consort, nor offspring. By My life! Were We to let fall but a drop from the ocean of this Most Great Sea in mentioning this most inaccessible station unto the chiefs of men in these days, they would surely flee and run from around this Cause, save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, willeth. Today, those immersed in the ocean of detachment and established in the Most Glorious Ark have attained a station wherein these stations are not even mentioned, much less the mention of those who have inhaled the fragrance of innovation from the garment of the Cause and have been purified from that which is possessed by the people. Say: This, verily, is the Innovator of the heavens and earth, Who cannot be weighed by any balance nor measured by any means. Blessed is he who hath recognized the decree of innovation and is of those who are firmly established. Blessed, again blessed, then blessed is he who hath pondered upon that which hath been mentioned and hath recognized that which was concealed in the depths of allusions, and hath discovered that from which the people were veiled. By My life! He is of those who are knowing, mature, and sincere. The Hand of Grace rent asunder some of the august veils while leaving others intact. Thus, because of these veils, the people were barred from the Dawning-Place of verses, even as thou observest how the rebellious faction hath prevented some of the people of the Bayan from the effulgence of the Divine Sun and the Ocean of Oneness through the mention of unseemly imaginings and ancient tales. Such hath been the way of the people from the primal beginning until now. None of the previous Manifestations hath mentioned the subsequent Revelation as mentioned in the Bayan. In this are signs and evidences for those who are detached. By God, the Truth! Thou hearest from the Nightingale, singing upon the twigs of the Lote-Tree of the Bayan, naught but praise of this praise that is manifest in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and the eye that hath seen. The Author of the Bayan had no purpose save this Most Great Remembrance; otherwise, He would not have uttered a word, for naught else was worthy of mention, as He hath clearly stated in the Book. Know this, O ye who are endued with understanding! This is a day wherein the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth: “All things are perishable save My Face.” Whosoever today turneth away from the exalted Truth is perishing and evanescent in the shadow of negation, and whosoever turneth toward Him abideth steadfast and eternal in the shadow of His Face. And the Face is not limited by numerical limitations. That it hath been mentioned as fourteen districts is but for the guidance of the servants. For instance, were all who are on earth today to attain unto that which God desireth, all would be mentioned in the Face, gathered beneath the shadow of the Face, and reckoned as of the Face. And when the effulgences radiating from the Primal Word shine forth upon the manifestations of names […]</p>
<p>When the effulgences emanating from the Primal Word are manifested upon the repositories of Names and Attributes from the bearer of universal grace at the primary level, they are therefore circumscribed by numerical limitation. If there be one bearer, it is mentioned as one, and if above that, it is known accordingly. This mention occurs at the station of the primary determination, which is the station of the Will of contingent existence. This is of God’s grace, which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. And should He desire, He is able, and hath ever been able, to establish at the foremost station that soul which occupieth the final station of the effulgences emanating from the horizon of Divine Unity, for He maketh that soul one of the manifestations of “He is the First” at the time when “He is the Last.” The Command is in His grasp. By His sovereignty, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He desireth. None hath the right to hesitate regarding His word, and whoso hesitates is assuredly among the most lost. In brief, all exist through His command and through His command become non-existent. We beseech God - exalted be His glory - to aid all and enable them to attain unto the knowledge of God and to stand firm in His Cause, for this is the ultimate station possible in the realm of contingent being, for it revolveth around itself and is powerless to transcend its limits. Glorified is the Ancient of Days from being associated with that which is contingent, and glorified is He from being reached by that which is contingent.</p>
<p>Likewise, a question was asked concerning sleep. It is a special world among the divine worlds and is indicative of infinite matters. Among other things, it is evidence of a realm wherein no beginning or end, no first or last, can be witnessed. Thus, something is observed in sleep, and after a number of years that very same thing is witnessed. If it be said that this is the world of similitudes between the two worlds - which some consider to be a semi-spiritual realm between the worlds of spirit and matter - this would be correct. In any case, if thou dost ponder it, thou wilt grasp endless mysteries. It likewise beareth witness to the resurrection and revival after death, even as Luqman said to his son: “If thou art able not to sleep, thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to awaken after sleep, thou art able not to be raised after death.” Even as death is a reality, so is sleep a reality, and even as there is awakening after sleep, so is there resurrection after death. Sleep sometimes varies according to the differences in souls, thoughts, food and drink. In the dreams of holy souls there hath been and is no variation, for they are pure wakefulness. O questioner! Man is the greatest index and the mightiest talisman. He is an index in which are found the representations of all that hath been created in earth and heaven. When the spirit is freed from incidental limitations and earthly conditions, it traverseth all stations, and the more it is detached, the swifter, more constant and more truthful is its journey. If it be said that the human temple is, in one station, the kingdom of God, this is the truth in which there is no doubt, for the representation of all things is found and witnessed therein. Though some have called it the lesser world, yet We bear witness that it is the greater world. Its changes and variations have been and shall be due to other causes, like the change in the taste of a sick person who perceiveth bitterness in that which is sweet. The change hath not occurred in the sweetness, rather the taste hath altered. Sufficient and complete utterances concerning these stations have been revealed by the Pen of Command during the sojourns in Iraq and the Land of Mystery. Therefore, We have been brief, although these same points have been repeatedly set forth in the Tablets, for they have been repeatedly asked about. However, all that hath been revealed in the Books and Scriptures, whether in Arabic or Persian, is scattered and dispersed. God will assuredly gather them together in truth. Verily, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou didst inquire about dream interpretation. Interpret dreams, for We have given thee permission and will assist thee in this. He is verily the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The foundation, however, is steadfastness in My Cause. Whoso attaineth unto this, God shall cause to flow from his heart the oceans of realities and knowledge, and whoso slippeth therefrom is accounted among the ignorant.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! The Tongue of Grandeur proclaims: By My Self, the Truth! All Revelations have culminated in this Most Great Revelation. Whosoever claims a Revelation after this is verily a lying impostor. We beseech God to enable him to recant; if he repents, He is verily the Forgiver, and if he persists in what he has claimed, God will assuredly send one who will show him no mercy. He is truly the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>Behold how the people of the Bayan have failed to understand that whatsoever the Herald of My Beauty and the Manifestation before Me uttered was in contemplation of this Revelation and its establishment. Otherwise, by His true Self, they would not have uttered a single word of what they said. These ignorant ones have considered the Cause of the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, as child’s play. Each day they move according to some fancy and wander in some wilderness. Were the Cause as they assert, how could thy Lord’s Cause be established upon the throne of tranquility? Reflect and be of those who are discerning. Reflect and be of those who perceive. Reflect and be of those who are steadfast. Reflect and be of those who are assured, to such extent that shouldst all humanity lay claim to whatsoever is possible or beyond it, thou wouldst not turn toward them but wouldst leave them behind thee, advancing toward the Qiblih of all worlds.</p>
<p>By My life! The Cause is mighty, mighty, and this Day mighty, mighty. Blessed is he who hath cast behind him all else, turning toward the countenance of Him through Whose light the heavens and earth were illumined.</p>
<p>O Dhabih! A penetrating vision is needed, and a stalwart heart, and legs of brass, lest one stumble through the whisperings of the hosts of vain fancy. This is the firm decree which, through the will of the Ancient King, hath flowed from the Pen of the Most Great Name. Preserve it as thou wouldst preserve thine eyes, and be of the thankful ones.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who standeth before the faces of all religions!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath opened wide the portal of divine knowledge through the key of utterance, and hath caused to rain down from the heaven of proof the showers of loving-kindness with power and authority. At His call the people of unity have arisen, and by His verses the manifestations of polytheism and rebellion were struck down. When He was established upon the throne of revelation on the Mount, all things cried out from every direction: “O concourse of divines and rulers! The Source of Revelation hath come with the banners of His signs!”</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Single, the One. Sanctify thy breast from the traces of names and thy heart from the doubts of men, that there may be inscribed therein, by the Most Exalted Pen, the sovereignty and dominion, and the might and power of God, the Lord of all men. We have mentioned thee before with verses whereby the hearts of the servants were drawn unto God, the Lord of lords.</p>
<p>He who was named Abdullah hath appeared, who took for himself a station beneath the canopies of grandeur and drank the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Creator of existence.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Baqir! Rejoice that the Euphrates of utterance hath flowed in thy name in days wherein the Hidden Secret and the Treasured Symbol have been revealed, through a command from God, the Cleaver of Dawn. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be hindered by the hosts of the wicked nor by the power of those who have disbelieved in the Beginning and the Return.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-’Ali! The Most Great Name hath turned toward thee and mentioned thee with words from which wafteth the fragrance of loving-kindness and favor. Behold, then remember those days when thou wert present before the Face and didst hear His sweet call and the scratching of His Most Exalted Pen. Give thanks and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the reins of those who have denied God’s proof and His evidence, and who have uttered that which hath caused every knowing and discerning one to weep.” Blessed art thou for having attained His presence and heard, and for having won that through which the fragrance of reunion was wafted abroad while the Wronged One was in the hands of the ignorant.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad-Sadiq, who recognized that which was sent down from the heaven of grace and hastened until he arrived with such steadfastness as caused feet to slip. By My life! There hath been ordained for thee that which neither the gold of the world nor all that the nations possess can equal. To this beareth witness the Mother Book in this station which hath been named by all names by God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. Remember what thou didst hear before thy Lord’s throne and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Beloved of all worlds!”</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Thou hast heard My call time and again. It hath drawn thee to the most exalted station. Say: “O people of the Bayan! Cast aside your vain imaginings. The Sun of Certitude hath shone forth from the horizon of God’s will, the Lord of the earths and the heavens.” He who loved Me hath made mention of thee and hath spoken My praise, and We have sent thee from the direction of the Prison that which shall assist thee in guiding those who have broken the Covenant and the Testament. Rejoice in My mention of thee. By My life! The books of Iran cannot equal it. To this beareth witness the Mother of the Bayan from God, the Lord of all religions.</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who was named ’Ali-Muhammad, who ascended the ladder of utterance unto God, the Revealer of mysteries. Grieve not over anything, but trust in God in all conditions. Verily, He is with thee and will aid thee through the hosts of revelation and inspiration. We beseech God to make thee so steadfast in the Cause that the clamor of the wicked shall not prevent thee. O ’Ali! Thou hast been mentioned before the Throne, and We have revealed for thee that which hath rolled up the carpet of those who denied God’s proof and His verses that have encompassed all regions. We beseech God to ordain for thee every good thing He hath sent down in the Scriptures and Tablets. Say: […]</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to recognize Thee and for having revealed unto me that which draweth mankind nigh unto the most exalted station. We have desired to make mention of him whom We mentioned in the earliest days with a remembrance through which earth and heaven were illumined, and I am, verily, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Nabil-i-Baqir! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. We have mentioned thee time and again through verses that have enraptured the hearts of them that have turned with radiant countenances toward the Dawning-Place of Lights. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones and remind them of that which will draw them nigh unto the Source of Light - through which the Herald hath proclaimed: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the All-Munificent.”</p>
<p>We make mention of him who was named Isma’il, who turned toward Our horizon with a light whereby the hearts of the righteous were illumined. The glory that proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon him who was named Ni’matu’llah at this hour wherein the Tongue uttereth in the Kingdom of Utterance: “Glory and majesty belong unto God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.” We make mention of thy other son that he may rejoice in the bounty of his Lord and turn toward the Kaaba of God, saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast enabled me to draw nigh and to turn toward Thee.”</p>
<p>O Mirza Mahdi! Upon thee be everlasting glory. Arise to serve the Cause, detached from the world, and purify hearts with the Kawthar of thy Lord’s utterance, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We have remembered thee and sent down unto thee the table of divine knowledge - the bounty We have manifested from the treasury of thy Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>Say: O Abu’l-Qasim! Fear God and follow not every deluded impostor. Thou hast indeed attained unto Our presence and heard Our call, and the schemes of the oppressors are but in loss. We have revealed unto thee the pearls of wisdom and utterance from the ocean of thy Lord’s bounty, the Mighty, the All-Compelling. Say: O servant! Cast aside that which is imagined and take hold of the Self-Subsisting One, by the command of Him Who is the Lord of all men. That which was never manifest in creation hath been made manifest - to this testifieth He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in the Book.</p>
<p>Thou hast heard My verses and attained unto My presence, and We have revealed that which was treasured from time immemorial. Change thy garments, then return unto God and say:</p>
<p>O my God! I testify that Thou hast shown me Thy most exalted horizon and caused me to hear that for the hearkening of which Thou didst create the ears of Thy chosen ones. I have forsaken that which Thou didst command me and cast aside that whereunto Thou didst guide me, following my desires until they took hold of my reins and prevented me from drawing nigh unto Thee, O Revealer of clear tokens!</p>
<p>Hearken unto My call and judge fairly in this Cause, before which necks have bowed low when it was made manifest. We have unveiled the mysteries of what was and what is to come, yet the people remain heedless and veiled. They have cast aside that which they were bidden and taken that which was forbidden them in the Scriptures of God, the Revealer of verses. Thou didst follow the people of the past after having recognized and seen them wandering in the wilderness of idle fancies. Let not the clamor of the world and the turning away of the nations grieve thee. He hath come from the horizon of might with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all created things. They who have prevented thee from the waters of thy Lord’s mercy have no standing before God, the Revealer of clear proofs. Soon shalt thou witness that which shall testify to thy loss in days wherein the Ancient Beauty was established upon the Most Great Throne and spoke that which draweth mankind nigh unto the most exalted station.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory. Be steadfast in thy Lord’s Cause in such wise that the veils of glory shall not withhold thee from the Dawning-Place of might and beauty. We make mention of thy brother who was named Sulayman, and We beseech the Almighty to aid him in serving His Cause at morn and eventide. This is a day wherein the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh that which guideth the servants unto a station beyond which no mention can reach[…]</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Upon thee be My Glory and My Loving-kindness! We have made mention of thy father who ascended to the Most Exalted Companion, by virtue of which the hearts of those who cast away vain imaginings were attracted, turning to the horizon of certitude. Thy likeness was presented before the Throne, and We revealed for thee that which the reckoners are powerless to reckon. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath cast away what the people possess and taken what was sent down from God, the One, the All-Forgiving. Thou wert mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One, thy Lord, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, beareth witness to this.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The Euphrates of utterance hath flowed and the light of proof hath shone forth before all faces, yet most of the people perceive not. The verses have encompassed all who dwell on earth. Blessed is he who hath heard and seen, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. We have mentioned thee in numerous Tablets and have revealed for thee that which draweth the servants nigh unto the Mighty, the Beloved. The croaking of the ravens hath been raised in the cities and lands - this is what We foretold you aforetime by the command of the Lord of creation. Say: O people! The Day hath come and He Who was hidden and treasured in God’s knowledge, the Mighty, the All-Loving, hath been made manifest. Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness that the doubts of those who have denied God’s proof and evidence and have committed that which hath darkened their faces shall not hinder thee. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs and have taken what they were bidden by the source of idle fancies. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not every ignorant rejected one. This is the Day wherein He Who was inscribed by the Pen of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, hath come. Convey My greetings to My loved ones who were not deterred by the oppression of the world nor by the opposition of those who disbelieved in the Witness and the Witnessed. Be thou so steadfast in the Cause that the manifestations of opposition of those who have violated the Covenant and the pledges shall not hinder thee. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me in Thy days and revealed unto me what was concealed from eyes. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath prevailed over all things, and by Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed what was and what shall be, to aid me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the might of those who have denied Thy Sacred House shall not frighten me. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. Ordain for me that which shall exalt me through Thy name amongst Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art powerful over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all knowledge.</p>
<p>We have desired at this time to make mention of him who was named Mirza Salih, that the Kawthar of the All-Merciful’s utterance may purify him and draw him nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: O people! Hearken unto the call of God and follow not those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Beloved. He who loved Me hath mentioned thee; We make mention of thee from this praiseworthy station that thou mayest give thanks to thy Lord Who aided thee to turn toward Him when every detested polytheist was debarred therefrom. We beseech God to ordain for thee that which shall exalt thee and to send down upon thee from the clouds of bounty that whereby hearts are attracted.</p>
<p>O Rahim! The mercy hath been sent down from the heaven of thy Lord’s bounty, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Blessed is the servant who hath turned unto Him, and woe unto every heedless rejected one. We beseech God to open before thy face the door of His grace and to give thee to drink of the Kawthar of everlasting life from the hands of bounty and bestowal. Verily, there is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth by His command. He is the Powerful, the Guardian, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. And We beseech God to aid thee to serve His Cause and draw thee nigh unto Him. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling.</p>
<p>O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who was named ’Ali, who broke not Thy Covenant and Testament, and who bore witness to that which God Himself did testify: that there is none other God beside Him, the Single, the All-Informed. Say: O people of the Bayan! This is the Day wherewith God gladdened His Prophets and His chosen ones through His word: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.” Beware lest the clamor of the malicious keep thee back from God, the Lord of all worlds. Say: O people! I have forsaken the creed of a people who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. By God! Your might shall not frighten Me, nor shall your oppression hold Me back. To this testifieth the Tablet of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. This is the Day wherein the Mount circles round the Dawning-Place of Revelation, and the Kingdom of God proclaimeth: “The Desired One hath come with manifest sovereignty!” All things have testified to that which God testified before the creation of the heavens and earth: that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>He is the Manifest, the Clear.</p>
<p>At this time We have desired to make mention of all the friends of God, that all may drink from the flowing spring of the letters of the sweet-scented streams of verses and attain thereunto. Verily, He loveth His loved ones and showeth them the path of God, the Clear, the Straight. O people of Ta! Hearken unto the divine call with the ear of the soul and be not deprived of the lights of the Sun of inner meanings on this luminous Day. Verily, He guideth His loved ones unto the Most Great Sea, from whose waves can be heard: “The Day of Return hath come, and this is your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower,” Who speaketh in the Most Great Prison. Glory be to God, the Lord of Lords!</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Ta! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He summoneth you unto the Most Great Steadfastness, lest names hold you back from turning towards God, the Lord of all worlds. Your names were presented before the Throne and were sent by ’Abdu’llah who soared in My atmosphere, held fast to My Covenant, and clung to the hem of My luminous robe. Blessed is he and joy be unto him in that he desired for My loved ones My wondrous and glorious remembrance. Thereupon did My Pen move to make mention of you, My tongue did speak, and the Face of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, did turn toward you.</p>
<p>We beseech God to make you so steadfast that the mention of names will not deprive you from the ocean of grace and bounty. O people of Ta! It is intended that you arise to redress what has passed, so that whatsoever oppression was visited upon the Lord of the world in that land by the oppressors may be transformed by the light of justice and righteousness - that is, that later beloved deeds may illuminate the darkness of the past. Verily, your Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>Today all must engage in service to the Cause. Some of the clamorous ones in various regions have exerted mighty efforts to lead astray the helpless people. Reflect upon the previous party: they considered themselves the best of creation, yet on the Day of Manifestation they were seen to be among the most lost of all peoples. By God’s life! Such oppression was visited by that party upon the Seal of the Prophets that the Pen is powerless to recount it and the tongue falls short of enumerating it. Hold fast to the Persian Bayan which the Primal Point revealed for the enlightenment of the servants and recite it, that ye may become aware of the hidden mysteries. By God’s life! This is the truth, and after truth there is naught but error.</p>
<p>O friends of God in Milan! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, maketh mention of you in this far-off Prison. Ye have attained unto the recognition of God and His signs. Beware lest the clamorous ones hold you back from God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him and the might that emanateth from His presence. Verily, He will protect you, make you known, and guide you to the manifest Truth, the Speaker, the Clear. The honored Amin - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness - hath repeatedly made mention of you. Blessed is he and blessed are you and blessed is he who holdeth fast unto the Strong Cord of God.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Sisan! Hear ye My call and be not of them that are silent. Remember your Lord, the All-Merciful, with such steadfastness as will cause the limbs of the heedless to quake. Ye have ever been remembered and continue to be remembered in the presence of this Wronged One. We have sent down to you aforetime that which hath diffused the sweet savors of revelation and the fragrance of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Generous. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to give you to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness by the hand of His bounty. He, verily, is the Protector of them that do good. He who visited you hath made mention of you, wherefore have We remembered you in this mighty Book. Rejoice in God’s grace and mercy, then remember Him at morn and eventide.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Shammakh! The Lord of the worlds hath made mention of you from His Most Great Prison and hath given you glad tidings of that which He hath ordained for you. Verily, He loveth His loved ones and acquainteth them with that which draweth them nigh unto Him. He is indeed the All-Merciful, the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Grieve not at anything, but in all matters place your trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. He is with you, maketh mention of you, and heareth your call. He is, in truth, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Follow not every vain imaginer, but follow ye the truth and this perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Aid Thy loved ones to do that which beseemeth Thy days, then ordain for them the recompense of attaining Thy presence and meeting with Thee. Thou, verily, hast power to do what Thou willest, and Thou art indeed the All-Bountiful, Whose grace and mercy have encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. Strengthen their hearts that they may renounce all else but Thee, holding fast unto that which hath been sent down in Thy Ancient Book.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Saliyan! Your names were presented before the Wronged One, sent by him who was named ’Azizu’llah. We have sent down for you that which hath enraptured the hearts of them that are nigh unto God. Soon will there come unto you a crier; leave him to himself, turning your faces toward the horizon from which hath shone forth the Sun of the mercy of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have upraised the Cause through a power which the might of the oppressors hath failed to weaken. Beware lest ye be frightened by the clamor of them who have denied the proof of God and His testimony, and were accounted among the transgressors in the sight of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O My companions in Banab! The Almighty, the All-Bountiful, maketh mention of you on this glorious and wondrous Day. This is the Day whereon the Sun of utterance hath shone forth from the horizon of the will of your Lord, the All-Merciful, and the light hath shone forth as a bounty from His presence. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bountiful. Deprive not yourselves of the Most Great Ocean, nor your eyes from beholding the Dayspring of God’s Cause, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. We have made mention of you before in diverse Tablets, as a mercy from God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. He who hath taken his station round about the House hath made mention of you; We have remembered you again and again with joy and fragrance. Should ye encounter one who denieth or turneth away, leave him to himself, placing your trust in God, the Lord of all lords. Thus hath spoken the One Who conversed upon Sinai, while seated upon the throne of Manifestation, as a bounty from His presence. He is, verily, the All-Glorious, the Most-Bountiful. The glory from Us be upon you and upon My handmaidens who have believed and turned unto God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of My loved ones in Maraghih who have turned with radiant faces and illumined hearts unto God, the Revealer of verses. Ye must strive at all times to exalt the blessed Most Great Word. The days are fleeting, its hues are fleeting, its ornaments are fleeting. Hold fast to the cord of divine favor. Beseech the True One to aid you in that which leadeth to eternal salvation and everlasting life. The deniers of the Cause lie in wait at every turn, seeking to lead souls astray. We have made known to all the peoples of the world, and especially to Our loved ones, that which draweth them nigh and causeth their exaltation. Let him who willeth accept it, and him who willeth turn away.</p>
<p>O son of Dakhil! Hearken unto My call and arise to serve My Cause with the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Then observe and remember when thou didst stand before the Countenance and didst hear My sweetest call and behold My most glorious horizon. Blessed art thou and blessed is every fair-minded one who hath been just in this Cause, whereby the hearts of the wicked who denied God’s proof and evidence, turned away from His presence, and committed that which caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise to lament at eventide and at dawn. Say: My God, my God! Aid me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee, then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have committed my affairs unto Thee and have placed my trust in Thee. I beseech Thee to inspire me with that which draweth the hearts of Thy servants. O my Lord! Thou seest the weak one clinging to the cord of Thy power and sovereignty, desiring naught but to serve Thy Cause. I beseech Thee to enable him to do that which befitteth Thy days and is worthy of Thy Revelation. Verily Thou art the Helper, the All-Bountiful. Withhold not Thy loved ones from the outpourings of Thy days, then deliver them by Thy mighty arm. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>We wish at this moment to make mention of Our loved ones in Khoy, that this remembrance may draw them nigh unto the most exalted station. Hear ye My call from the precincts of the Prison. It guideth you unto a station whereon hath been raised the banner that there is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Jalil! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, Who hath come from the heaven of utterance with a power before which all the hosts of earth and heaven are powerless to resist. Remember the days when thou wert present before the Wronged One and didst hear that which the near ones heard at morn and eventide. Thy letter hath reached Us wherein thou didst mention the names of My loved ones who have rent asunder the veils through power, might and sovereignty. We counsel them to manifest supreme steadfastness that their stations may be made evident amongst the people. Convey My greetings unto them and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, and remind them of My verses that have encompassed all regions. Thus hath the Tongue of Glory spoken in the prison of Akka by the command of God, the Revealer of mysteries. Say: My God, my God! Illumine the hearts of Thy servants with the light of Thy knowledge and their faces with the splendor of Thy countenance, and ordain for them all the good Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. O my Lord! Thou seest the poor one standing before the door of Thy riches. I beseech Thee not to deprive me and Thy servants from the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>The glory from Us be upon thee and upon My loved ones in that place, and upon My handmaidens who have heard the call and have said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all who are in earth and heaven!”</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Qaf! The pillars of polytheism have been shaken when the Horseman of the arena of divine unity came with power from God, the Lord of all worlds. The Ancient Countenance has turned toward you and mentions you with that by which your names shall endure in the Book of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. He counsels you to such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the doubts of the suspicious ones. The gate of heaven has been opened and its Creator has come, yet most people remain heedless. Blessed are you and those who love you and hear your words concerning this Great Announcement.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Some of the hypocrites, who are not and never were worthy of mention, are occupied with leading people astray. Their intention is to establish, like the previous party, a faction based on suspicions and idle fancies, even though they have witnessed with their own eyes the loss incurred by that party. Ask God to sanctify hearts, illuminate faces, and protect His servants from the evil of the heedless and the doubters. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. But deeds have been and continue to be the cause of deviation. This arena requires another horseman and another rider. We beseech God to reveal the treasures of the earth - meaning those men who are worthy of this arena and those horsemen befitting this field.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in that place! You have always been remembered and continue to be remembered, and from the hand of bounty you have received that pure wine which had and has no likeness. Now you must manifest such steadfastness as has had and shall have no peer or equal. All the men of that land are present and mentioned in the Most Holy Court, and the women of that land have attained divine favors and bounties. This Wronged One is occupied with mentioning the loved ones in all conditions - in the nights I remember them, in the days I speak their names, and in the dawn hours I utter their remembrances. We beseech God to assist them and draw them near to Him. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O My loved ones in its surroundings! Hear the call of the Wronged One - there is no God but Him, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. We call you to God and mention you with a mention through which the fragrance of utterance has wafted throughout creation. Exalted is God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Beware lest anything prevent you or the assault of any rejected oppressor frighten you. We have mentioned you before and after, and you have attained to that which the Ancient Beauty has spoken from His praiseworthy station. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to reinforce you with the hosts of utterance and to assist you in rending the veils of idle fancy.</p>
<p>My God, my God! Assist these ones to aid Thy Cause with such steadfastness as will astonish minds. Then ordain for them the reward of meeting Thee and of attaining presence before Thy throne. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>O Land of Ba before Alif and Ra! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth you for the sake of God, the Lord of what hath been and what shall be. This is the Day whereon all those nigh unto God and the sincere ones utter “Praise be unto Thee, O our God!” Blessed is the soul that hath tasted the chalice of steadfastness - a chalice which, when quaffed, causeth one to fix one’s gaze upon none save God, exalted be His glory, and to turn toward no horizon save His. This Kawthar of certitude is reserved for the manifestations of power and assurance. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and hath drunk from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Gracious.</p>
<p>In that land there appeared manifestations of evil souls and deceiving, lying devils who martyred the gems of being with such tyranny that the heaven with its stars wept and the trees with their fruits lamented. Now, through the grace of God, exalted be His glory, since that land is in the vicinity of a village that is associated with the Truth, there must appear men who are dawning-places of virtues and daysprings of fellowship and unity. Well is it with you! God shall soon raise up therefrom men who will hold fast unto none save God and who will act according to naught save that which they have been bidden in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>His honor Abdullah, who dwelleth in Our vicinity, made mention of you. Therefore, the pearls of remembrance that were hidden in the shells of the Most Great Sea have now appeared in the form of letters and words. We counsel you unto that which is the cause of fellowship and the manifestation of mercy. The friends of God are, in one station, fountainheads of the Salsabil of utterance and the Kawthar of knowledge. They must water the trees of souls with these waters. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to aid you through His bounty, to assist you through His sovereignty, and to protect you through His hosts from on high. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O people of Ba before Dal! In these days the rain of favors and bounties hath fallen upon that land, the clouds of His grace and generosity have appeared, and the heaven of His bestowal and favor hath been unveiled. Blessed are ye and joy be unto you! Repeatedly have your names been revealed and sent down from the Most Exalted Pen. I counsel you to observe wisdom and to obey the sovereign who ariseth to assist and to protect the friends from the evil of enemies. Deal ye with all the peoples of the world with gentleness and forbearance. Conflict, contention and corruption have been removed. All are commanded to show forth love and promote reconciliation. Blessed are they that act accordingly.</p>
<p>Verily, the Wronged One hath remembered you and hath revealed for you that whereby your names shall endure in the Crimson Book. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. We gave you glad tidings aforetime, and at this hour, from the presence of One mighty and ancient. Beware lest the happenings of the world grieve you or the doubts of the heedless hold you back. The glory, the remembrance and the praise from God, the Lord of the exalted Throne, be upon you.</p>
<p>O Land of Ta! The Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath turned His gaze toward the Land of Ta which God hath made the dawning-place of the joy of all worlds. We have remembered Our loved ones there time and again, and have sent down for them that which God hath once made the Kawthar of life for all who are in the heavens and on earth, and another time the enduring Food. Blessed is he who hath seen and circumambulated and hath said: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the first and the last!” We bear witness that Our loved ones there have testified to that whereunto God testified before the creation of all things, and have attained unto that which was inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books of the Messengers. O Abdullah! Upon thee be the Glory of God, His grace and His bounty. Give them glad tidings from Me, then recite unto them that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty, for I am the All-Merciful, the Generous. We have illumined them with the light of My knowledge and exalted them through My words, and We made known unto them in the earliest days My path and the fragrance of My mercy which hath preceded all things from God, the Lord of the worlds. O My loved ones in that land! Rejoice in My remembrance and soar on the wings of faithfulness in My atmosphere, and associate with My servants with My praiseworthy and wondrous character. We have sent unto you at this time the chalices of My words wherein is contained the choice wine of My bounty. Blessed are they who drink thereof. In all conditions, the souls that are tranquil, steadfast and upright have been and are the recipients of special favors. They are the cupbearers of the divine Kawthar and the guides to the paths of the Lord. Blessed is he who attaineth unto their presence and heareth that which proceedeth from their mouths concerning this mighty Cause. Praise be to God as is befitting! They have attained, and the glances of grace are fixed upon them. Blessed are they and blessed is he who loveth them, as bidden by God, the Commander, the Ancient of Days. The leaves and handmaidens of that land have ever been the recipients of grace. We beseech God to ordain for them the good of every world among His worlds and to decree for them that which He hath decreed for the Maids of the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily, He is the Giver, the Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee, O Abdullah, and upon those whom names have not kept back from their Lord and Sovereign, who have turned unto Him, and have heard, and have said: “We believe in Thy Manifestation, O Beloved of the hearts of them who are nigh unto Thee and the Object of the hearts of them that have recognized Thee!” Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>=== END BH00136 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00137 ===</p>
<p>Praise be sanctified above the mention of all created things and exalted beyond the attributes of contingent beings - praise that befits and is worthy of the Sovereign of the Throne of Grandeur, Who, in the darkness of these days, caused the light of His Most Exalted Word to shine forth and appear manifest from the horizon of His Will. Neither the might of the powerful, nor the armies of monarchs, nor the doubts of the divines, jurists and scholars could deter Him from His purpose. He hath spoken before the faces of all the world that which hath caused the seas to surge, the mountains to take flight, and the Dove of Paradise to warble at the dawning light of the splendors of Beauty. By God! The Desired One hath come, and through Him hath appeared that which was hidden in the Presence of Knowledge and inscribed in the Books of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Radiant light be upon those who have arisen to serve the Cause and have spoken in praise of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. These are servants whom neither the might of tyrants nor the hosts of pharaohs could deter. They arose and spoke that which the Tongue of Grandeur had uttered before the creation of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Thou through Whose Name the gate of reunion was opened to all who are in earth and heaven, and the nightingales of divine knowledge warbled upon the branches. Verily Thou art God; there is none other God but Thee. I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of Heaven, by the Crimson Scroll and by Thy Most Exalted Pen, to assist Thy chosen ones to celebrate Thy praise and glorify Thee. Then raise them up, O my God, amongst Thy servants and Thy creation. Thou beholdest them, O my God, turning unto Thee and setting their faces toward Thy countenance. I beseech Thee not to leave them at the mercy of the oppressors among Thy creatures and the transgressors among Thy servants. I implore Thee, O God of the Kingdom and the Realm, and Sovereign of the Celestial Dominion, by Thy Name through Whose manifestation all names bowed down in prostration and all things submitted themselves in humility before Thy Face and in lowliness at Thy Revelation, to aid Thy loved ones with Thy hosts and protect them from the enemies of Thy Self - they who have violated Thy Covenant, disputed Thy signs, and disbelieved in Thy clear evidences. Verily Thou art the All-Powerful, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart and one remembered in my heart! The servant has been honored with your letters time and again, and from each has found the fragrance of your love for God, your arising to serve Him among His servants, and your mention and praise of Him among His creation. The servant beseeches his Lord to assist you in all conditions and to make you as a banner upon the hills. Verily He is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>In truth, this servant is remiss in one respect, yet has always hoped for forgiveness, as one must act according to the requirements of wisdom. For a long time, due to the conflicts between the parties of the earth and the kindling of the fires of war in all regions, there was delay in sending whatever was written in response to the letters of the friends, especially after the upheaval in the land of Ta. Glorified art Thou, O God of Names! Thou seest Thy chosen servants in the prison of the enemies. Blessed are they and joy be unto them! They have attained in Thy days through their turning and devotion, and have testified to that which Thy Tongue testified before all things, and have done what Thou commanded them in the realm of creation, until they were seized for Thy love and entered prison in Thy Name.</p>
<p>I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Controller of the seen and unseen, to pour forth upon them patience from Thy presence, then aid them against the transgressing people through Thy power, Thy might, and Thy sovereignty. The servant bears witness that they have attained unto a bounty that shall never perish and a mention that ages and centuries shall not alter. They are those from whom every possessor of smell has found the fragrance of submission and contentment, and every possessor of sight has beheld the countenance of patience and faithfulness.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name, through which the horizon of the world was illumined, to assist them to be steadfast in Thy Cause, then transform the poison of tribulation into honey through Thy grace and bounty, and severe decree into ease through Thy mercy. Verily Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>By the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal! Were the servant to remember them throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm, it would not quench his thirst of love for them in the path of God, the King of this wondrous and exalted Day. When I read your letter and became aware of what was in it of your traces, I approached the Station that cannot be described by names nor characterized by what is mentioned by the people of creation. When I reached the Gate, I bowed down and prostrated myself in humility before the face of God, then entered and stood, and after permission, presented what was in your letter. After this was completed, the Ancient Countenance turned toward me and spoke that which diffused the fragrance of revelation throughout the world. He said, exalted be His utterance, sublime His proof, complete His argument, and perfect His remembrance and praise:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Remembering, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>O Ali! The waves of tribulation have encompassed Us from every side, and the evidences of Divine decree have taken hold of Us from all directions. The Revealer of verses and the Manifestor of clear proofs speaks at all times even as He spoke before the creation of earth and heaven, saying: “There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.” By My Life! The machinations of nations cannot frustrate Me, nor can the might of the world. I have arisen through My power and strength before all faces, and My tongue hath spoken that which hath caused the limbs of them that have disbelieved in the Day of Judgment to quake. Say: O concourse of earth! Your Goal and your Beloved, Whom ye have mentioned in nights and days, hath come. Fear God and deny not Him in Whom ye have believed before. Cast away what ye possess and take hold of that which ye are commanded in that which hath been sent down in a perspicuous Book. This is the Day wherein the Mother Book speaketh, did ye but know, and wherein the Most Great Name calleth aloud among the nations, did ye but hear. The Hidden One hath appeared, did ye but perceive. Beware lest the affairs of creation hinder you from the Truth. Arise in My Name, then aid Him through remembrance and utterance. Thus hath the matter been decreed from the presence of an Ordainer, All-Wise. O Ali! The clamor of which We had informed thee beforehand hath been raised, and that which had been inscribed by My Most Exalted Pen in various Tablets hath come to pass. To this every discerning one beareth witness. We have sent down for thee that from which the fragrance of My loving-kindness hath been wafted. To this My tongue in My exalted station beareth witness. And We have sent down for every name that was in thy book that whereby those who are nigh unto God perceive the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord, the Gracious. Convey My glory to the faces of My loved ones who were not hindered by the promptings of any deceiver, nor were they frightened by the tyranny of any remote oppressor. Say: Hold fast unto the Book of God and His Cause. By My life! That which the people possess shall perish, and that which hath been ordained for you by an All-Knowing, All-Wise Protector shall endure.</p>
<p>From whatsoever hath been sent down from the Kingdom of Divine favor, every soul doth inhale the fragrance of grace and bounty. What else can this evanescent servant mention or submit? At all times he beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, to protect His loved ones and preserve them from the evil of the cawing ones. The oppression of the divines and that which hath befallen the friends at the hands of rulers hath been and continueth to be the cause of the exaltation of the Word, as hath been witnessed in the past and present. If God, exalted be His glory, were to unveil for them what He hath unveiled for His loved ones, all would be seen turning toward the supreme horizon. To most people today the Cause hath become obscure; they have imagined that the party of God, exalted be His glory, are workers of corruption rather than of reformation. The cawing ones who have turned away from the Most Great Ocean and set their faces toward the fetid spring have manifested the utmost enmity and the most grievous cruelty. Each day they are occupied with a new deceit. They plagiarize from the divine verses and utter calumnies such as the Pharaohs and tyrants of old never uttered. The Sun is shining, the Moon is gleaming, and the Full Moon is manifest, yet all are heedless. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, and implore Him to protect His loved ones from the like of such souls. He is, verily, powerful and mighty over all things.</p>
<p>The offering of greetings and salutations to the friends of that land is entrusted to that beloved one, and for all I seek steadfastness. In the divine Tablets this word hath repeatedly been revealed - His word, exalted and mighty is He: “The beginning of all things is the knowledge of God, and the end thereof is steadfastness in His Cause.” We must, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseech the Goal of all creation that He may adorn all with the ornament of steadfastness. Some souls, despite their claims of steadfastness, certitude and assurance, were veiled by a single cawing from the flow of the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, they are among the wrongdoers in the perspicuous Book. For each one of the names, a most holy and exalted Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to cause all to attain, and to grant them sustenance from the ocean of inner meanings that lie concealed and treasured within the words. How often it happens that one’s hand is immersed in the ocean, yet one fails to drink therefrom. However, this is the Day of Grace. The hope of the world is in motion and ecstasy, even though its people perceive it not.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for him who was named Karbala’i Isma’il. His words, blessed and exalted is He:</p>
<p>He is the Counselor, the All-Knowing</p>
<p>Today from the rustling of the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, this most exalted Word is heard: Blessed is every hearer and blessed is every one who turneth unto it. O peoples of the earth! He Who was treasured in knowledge and recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds, hath come. O Isma’il! Hold fast unto the Word of God. Shouldst thou discover its fragrance, thou wouldst find thyself in a paradise whose breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and of the earth. To this beareth witness He Who speaketh in the prison - there is no God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Know thou, moreover, that should He speak a word, all the books of the world and whatsoever the peoples possess could not equal it. To this testifieth He with Whom is the perspicuous Book. God hath created the world through a word from Him for this Day wherein the Speaker on Sinai hath been established upon the throne with manifest sovereignty. Blessed be thine ear if it heareth what the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered in this wondrous and incomparable Tablet. The glory shining from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon those who have turned toward the Countenance when every heedless sinner turned away therefrom.</p>
<p>And this is what was revealed for His Honor Mulla ’Ali, upon him be the glory of God. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof […]</p>
<p>In the Name of Him Who gazeth from Mine All-Glorious Horizon!</p>
<p>This is a Book sent down by the All-Knowing from the Kingdom of Utterance unto him who hath turned unto the All-Informed, that it may draw him to a station wherein he beholdeth naught in existence save the signs of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. A letter hath come before the Wronged One wherein thou art mentioned. We make mention of thee with that which the ornaments of the world cannot equal. Be thankful unto thy Lord, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Take hold of the Book with the strength that cometh from Him and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having remembered me whilst Thou wert in prison, and glory be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of them that know!” Thus hath the Most Great Ocean sprinkled upon thee that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that are assured. The remembrance shining from the horizon of the heaven of Mine utterance be upon thee and upon them who have attained unto tranquility when earthquakes seized all the tribes of the earth save whom God, the Lord of all worlds, did will.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God. His word - exalted be His utterance and complete His proof:</p>
<p>He is the Hearing, the Answering!</p>
<p>O Husayn! The Wronged One maketh mention of thee when the servants rose against Him with such enmity as the eye of time hath never beheld its like, and He, in the midst of tribulation, calleth the people unto the Supreme Horizon - the station wherein the Kingdom of Utterance proclaimeth: “There is none other God but I, the Almighty, the Powerful.” Take heed lest the affairs of the world sadden thee or the veils of the heedless ones prevent thee - they who sit in positions of authority and claim knowledge without any clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Blessed is the one who, being strong, casteth away what they possess, turning unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Whoso hath today attained unto My recognition hath attained unto all good - to this have God’s Books, both past and future, borne witness. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless ones. Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Thus doth the Dawning-Place of thy Lord’s revelation teach thee. Remember and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of all worlds!” The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them who have cast away idle fancies and acted according to that which they were bidden in the Book of Certitude from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Haji Mulla Ibrahim, upon him be the Glory of God. His word - blessed and exalted is He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful!</p>
<p>Today from the rustling of the winds of the All-Merciful’s utterance this word is heard: Whoso hath attained unto recognition of that which the Tongue of Revelation hath spoken hath attained unto that which none before him hath attained. Blessed is he who hath hearkened unto the Divine Call and turned unto His horizon. The world was created for this Day. All them that drew nigh unto God and were sincere did for years lament and bewail their separation from this Day. Blessed are they whom the veils of the learned have not hindered and whom the might of rulers hath not kept back from the recognition of God. Arise to guide the wayward unto the straight path through the name of Truth and with wisdom and utterance, and draw the heedless unto the quarter of awareness. Remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “Whoso quickeneth a soul is as though he had quickened all mankind.” In this Revelation this word hath been multiplied a hundredfold. Is there any hearing ear to be found in the land or any penetrating vision to be witnessed? In all conditions beseech ye the Self-Sufficing Lord that He deprive not His creatures of the breezes of His days. He is the Almighty to Whose power every possessor of knowledge hath testified. The glory manifest and resplendent from the horizon of My will be upon thee and upon every steadfast and firm one.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Mulla Karim, upon him be the Glory of God. His word - exalted be His grandeur:</p>
<p>In My Name, through which they that lay in their graves arose! […]</p>
<p>Say: O concourse of the heedless! He Who conversed on Sinai hath come, Whose advent was foretold in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords. Say: By God! The Fire hath appeared from the Divine Lote-Tree and the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh openly. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this bounty, the like of which hath never appeared in creation. By God! The world hath rejoiced at the appearance of the Ancient King, yet the peoples are in a wondrous slumber. O Karim! The All-Bountiful mentioneth thee in truth and calleth thee to God, the Lord of all men. We summoned the divines to the supreme horizon, yet they call Us to the dust. The call of the infidels is naught but error. Arise thou to serve the Cause and remind the servants of what hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen at morn and eventide. Say: O concourse of divines! Fear ye the Lord of Names. Leave behind what ye possess and turn with illumined hearts to the station which God hath made most exalted. The Mount hath been illumined by the lights of the Manifestation, and the Lote-Tree calleth out with its loudest voice: “The Kingdom belongeth to God, the One, the Almighty, the All-Choosing!” Is there any hearing ear that will hearken to My sweetest call? Is there any one with the sense of smell who will inhale the fragrance of My utterance whereby the kingdom of mystic knowledge was attracted? Thus doth My Most Exalted Pen move in the arena of utterance, by the command of God, the Lord of Religions. The Light shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon those whom the affairs of the world have not withheld from the Lord of all beings - they who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the earths and the heavens.”</p>
<p>And this was revealed for his honor Ahmad, upon him be the Glory of God. He, exalted and mighty, saith:</p>
<p>In the Name of the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing</p>
<p>O Ahmad! Reflect upon the words “may God hasten his relief.” I swear by the Sun of the horizon of inner meanings, were anyone to reflect purely for the sake of God, the Hand of His bounty would lead him to the ocean of knowledge, such that neither the whisperings of the polytheists nor the insinuations of the deniers would keep him from God, exalted be His glory. Those who arose mentioning His blessed name and uttering “may God hasten,” attacked with sword and spear and rose up to battle against the Manifestation of God’s Cause. O Ahmad! The recompense of the reprehensible deeds of the heedless souls prevented them from the Most Great Ocean and deprived them of the lights of the Sun of Truth. Whosoever today hath broken the chains of vain imaginings and rent asunder the veils of the ascetics, he is mentioned as the most exalted of creation before the Truth and is recorded by the Most Exalted Pen as being among the people of the Crimson Ark. Blessed are they who advance and woe unto those who turn away.</p>
<p>And this was revealed for his honor Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the Glory of God. He, exalted and mighty, saith:</p>
<p>He is the Expositor, the All-Knowing […]</p>
<p>This Wronged One has, during the nights and days, summoned the peoples of the earth to the horizon of the heaven of true knowledge, and all atoms bear witness that not for a moment has the Pen ceased to move. Though the outward Pen may at times have paused, the Pen of the Divine Command has remained in constant motion - a motion that no stillness can overtake. Yet the faithless people, in place of praise, have chosen cruelty, and instead of gratitude have begun to complain. Would that they had attained unto the hearing of but one word of the divine utterances! Would that they had perceived its fragrance! The intoxication of vain desires has seized them all, such that they remain deprived and veiled from the Lord of all beings. Reflect upon the deeds of humanity, and likewise upon what thou hast heard of the traces of this Revelation. Today the Concourse on High is astounded and the denizens of the Kingdom of Names are bewildered, for the One Whose beauty all eyes had yearned to behold and Whose praise was upon every tongue - after His appearance and manifestation, all arose in hypocrisy against Him. Blessed are the strong ones whom neither the might of princes weakened nor the power of enemies deprived of the Lord of Names. Forsake the world and all that is therein, and hold fast unto the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Behold negation as non-existent and cleave unto the hem of affirmation. This is the counsel of the Wronged One of the horizons to the loved ones of God, glorified be His majesty. Blessed be they that are nigh unto God, and they that are endued with true understanding, and they that act in accordance with His teachings, and woe unto the idolaters, and the heedless, and they that raise the call of ignorance.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Karbala’i Husayn, upon him be the glory of God. His word, exalted be His grandeur and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>I am the Rememberer and I am the Remembered One.</p>
<p>Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord, my Beloved, my Purpose, my Hope, and my Desire! I beseech Thee by the Ocean whereupon Thy people were carried, and by the Ark that sailed upon the sea of recognition through Thy Name and Thy favor, to send down upon all who exist that which befitteth Thy generosity and bounty. O Lord! Thou seest the enemies of Thy Self turning away from Thy Cause and striving to extinguish Thy light and quench the fire of Thy divine Unity. I beseech Thee by the power that hath encompassed all created things, and by the might that hath subdued all contingent beings, to send down from the heaven of Thy mercy upon them that are nigh unto Thee that which shall gladden their eyes and rejoice their hearts, in such wise that the sorrows of the world and the oppression of the nations shall not prevent them. O Lord! Aid them, then, with the hosts of the unseen and the visible realm, and ordain for them, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, that which Thou hast destined for Thy chosen ones who have expended all they possessed in Thy path and soared in the atmosphere of Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Strong, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We make mention of Muhammad-i-Qabli-Rida and counsel him with that wherewith We have counseled Our loved ones. He is, in truth, the Counselor, the Trustworthy. Hold fast unto the Book of God - verily, it will protect thee and draw thee nigh unto Him. Of this doth this Speaking Book, the Mighty, the Wondrous, bear witness. The glory of God rest upon thy son and his family, and upon thee, from God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>This is what was revealed for Haji Husayn, upon him be the glory of God. His word, exalted be His majesty and all-encompassing His grace:</p>
<p>I am the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>A remembrance from Our presence to one who has turned to the Truth on a day wherein all mankind hath turned away save those who have cast aside vain imaginings and clung to the hem of the robe of their Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all creation. This is the Day whereon all that lay hidden in hearts and veiled from eyes hath been made manifest. To this beareth witness the Pen of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, then make mention of Him amidst the denizens of Paradise. Beware lest the veils of the corrupt deter thee, or the might of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, frighten thee. We have revealed the pearls of the ocean of utterance unto all who dwell within the realm of possibility, yet the people have denied them, having followed their own desires and idle fancies. The Promised One hath come, and all things have cried out: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of the Hereafter and of the former days!” Among the people are those who heard, arose, turned and responded, and among them are those who denied, turned away, and committed that which caused the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise to lament. O people of Baha! Cast aside what the people possess and take hold of that which ye have been commanded by God, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, while seated upon the throne. Blessed is he who hath turned, heard and seen, and woe unto him who hath turned away and gone astray. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon My loved ones who have answered their Lord when the Call was raised amongst all peoples.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Muhammad Kazim, upon him be the glory of God. He saith, exalted be His dominion and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the One manifest from the highest horizon.</p>
<p>The signs have encompassed the world and the evidences have appeared. The Kawthar of utterance floweth before all faces and the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree is raised high. He Who conversed on Sinai calleth out with the most exalted call, and the Concourse on High circle round, yet the people are heedless to such a degree that they are observed to be unaware and deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of Truth and the waves of the ocean of knowledge. The grace of God is more manifest than the sun, yet these faithless people are for the most part veiled. Would that they had been content with denial and rejection! They have committed that which hath caused the denizens of the most exalted Paradise to cry out and lament. Throughout ages and centuries they awaited this Day, yet when it appeared they did that which the Pen is powerless to describe. O people of Baha! Beseech God, glorified and exalted be He, to guide the wayward ones of the earth and show them the path. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty. There is none other God but He, the Most High, the Most Glorious. We counsel the people of God, at the end of Our utterance, to fear God and to act in such wise as would exalt His Cause among His servants. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto the Truth, turning away from those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>This was revealed for Mulla Akbar. He saith, mighty be His utterance, sweet be His call, and mighty be His proof:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing Witness.</p>
<p>O Akbar! The Lord of humanity has come, every hidden matter has been revealed, and the call has been raised from the Most Great Scene, yet most of the people do not understand. Say: By God! That which was concealed has been manifested, that which was hidden has emerged, and He Who was promised has come. Hasten, O people, and be not of those who denied God’s grace and His Cause, who rejected His bounty and disputed His signs that have encompassed both earth and heaven. This is the Day when existence itself smiled at His mention, yet the people have turned away from Him. Say: Fear the All-Merciful, O people of the realm of possibility! Be fair in what has been revealed in truth. Come, that I may show you the Supreme Horizon; come, that I may cause you to hear the Call of God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Beware lest riches occupy you in these days of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Leave behind you the ornaments of the world, hastening to His station, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>O Akbar! Gather what the Most Great Ocean has cast upon thee of the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, then give thanks to thy Lord, the Possessor of the visible and invisible. This is the Day wherein one can hear from the waves of the sea: “The Sovereign has come”; from the rustling of the trees: “The Chosen One has appeared”; and from the murmuring of the waters: “The Kingdom belongs to the Lord of Names”–yet the people hear not. Thus has the rustling of the Lote-Tree of the Far Boundary been raised. Blessed is he who has heard, and woe unto every heedless and veiled one. The glory that has shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who have cast away idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The fishes of love have attained unto the ocean of the All-Merciful’s utterance, and the moons of the horizons of knowledge have derived the lights of inner meaning from the Sun of Truth. This servant beseecheth God to assist them to remain steadfast and to grant them a complete portion from His wondrous and exalted Tablets.</p>
<p>Know ye that concerning the treatise on proofs which ye wrote, it was presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence. Thus spoke the All-Merciful, exalted be His utterance: In these matters it would be more fitting and appropriate to present the Kitab-i-Iqan and the Tablet to the Shah. O Ali, be not grieved by the clamor of the heedless and the outcries of the polytheists. Ere long will the standards of justice and fairness be raised throughout all regions in the name of Truth. Today all monarchs consider this people to be mischief-makers, for in truth at the beginning certain deeds were manifested by some of this community that caused the very pillars of faith to tremble. They took possession of people’s property without permission, and counted murder, bloodshed, plunder and pillage among praiseworthy deeds. They observed not the rights of any faction among the factions. And those souls imagined these acts to be acceptable, even though they were adorned with the ornament of divine love and crowned with the diadem of detachment. Due to their utter simplicity and lack of knowledge they committed such deeds and considered them all to be from God. These acts became the cause of people’s aversion and the clamor and turning away of mankind from the Truth. Now, for more than thirty years the fire of corruption, warfare, strife and contention has been quenched and extinguished in all regions and countries, yet still they remain in doubt and uncertainty. Glory be to God! In the divine Tablets all that causes grief was forbidden, let alone deeds that cause terror and alarm among people. Beseech ye God that He may make His servants aware and grant them sustenance from the ocean of knowledge. For if they were to become somewhat aware and understand the purpose of God, exalted be His glory, both ruler and subject, both wayfarer and pauper would all turn toward the court of God’s favor and cling to the hem of His grace. Blessed art thou, O Ali! We bear witness that thou hast heard in the path of God and witnessed that which grieved the hearts of the Concourse on High. Rejoice thou in this testimony which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken in His mighty prison. Upon thee be My glory and upon those who have held fast to the cord of God when He came with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>In all conditions the gain hath been and is with the friends of Truth. These injuries and harms shall become the source and dayspring of triumph, success and good. Every person of insight and hearing hath testified and doth testify that whatsoever hath flowed and doth flow from the Most Exalted Pen hath been and is being fulfilled word for word. O thou beloved one, if the treatise on proofs that was written is sent to this servant it would be appreciated. God willing, through divine grace, ease shall follow hardship and comfort shall follow distress. Consider ye the companions of the Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake - what they were at first and what they became at last. At first some would satisfy their hunger with a date-stone, while at the end they would give away heaps and stacks in charity. The servant beseecheth his Lord to send down from the heaven of His bounty upon His loved ones a blessing from His presence. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. I convey greetings to the family members and relatives, upon them be the glory of God, and I beseech for each one that which befitteth the generosity of the Ocean of Bounty. Verily He is the Generous One to Whose grace, generosity, bounty and benevolence all created things have testified. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon them from God, the Kind, the Forgiving.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning-Place from the horizon of the heaven of utterance!</p>
<p>This is the Day wherein the Book speaketh before the face of all humanity: “There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower!” My Name, upon Him be My glory, hath appeared at the dawning of the Sun of Manifestation, and mentioned are the names of those who have sought the Ultimate Goal, the Supreme Summit, and the Highest Aim. Among them are those who attained and drank and triumphed, those who intended and hastened, those who acknowledged a single drop from the Most Great Ocean, and those whom the wine of recognition so intoxicated that they soared in the atmosphere of their Lord’s love, the All-Merciful, and were set ablaze with the fire of their Lord’s Cause, the Compassionate, the Mighty, the Gracious. Verily do We make mention of every name mentioned before His countenance, for He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Nasru’llah! The Wronged One hath mentioned thee aforetime with a mention before which all mentions bow down. We counsel thee and those who have believed to that whereby the signs of the All-Merciful may be made manifest in all possibility, and His Cause be exalted amongst His servants. When the morn of Revelation unfurled its standard and the Speaker of Sinai came forth, the divines arose in opposition. Among them were those who pronounced Him an infidel, those who turned away, those who objected, and those who unjustly pronounced against Him, whereby the veil of sanctity was rent asunder and the eyes of the righteous shed tears. Thus did their souls entice them. We bear witness that they are among the companions of the Fire.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the Bayan! Cast aside your vain imaginings. Beware lest ye act as they acted aforetime. Fear the All-Merciful and be not of those who turned away from God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>O Qasim! Cast aside what the people possess, taking hold of My Book with such strength that neither armies nor swords shall deter thee.</p>
<p>Say: O people of the earth! We have shown you the evanescence of all ye possess and caused you to hear mention of departure at all times. Cast aside your surmises and idle fancies; take what ye have been given from God, the Lord of all mankind. Be thou steadfast in serving My loved ones, speaking My praise, and holding fast to the cord of My loving-kindness. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee from the most exalted station.</p>
<p>We make mention in this station of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, whose flesh was mingled with the flesh of his Lord, his blood with His blood, his body with His body, and his bones with the bones of his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness that he hath attained unto that which none before him attained, and there befell him that of which no ear hath heard the like. Upon him be My glory and the glory of My Kingdom and My Dominion, and the people of the cities of justice and fairness. Blessed art thou, O Muhammad, in that thou hast attained unto the choice wine of utterance from thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus hath the Sun of proof shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all beings.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Karim! The All-Bountiful hath come, yet every possessor of doubts turned away from Him. The ocean of generosity hath surged before all existence, yet most of the people are in astonishing delusion. They have cast the Command of God behind their backs. Verily, they are among the veiled ones in the sight of God, the Revealer of verses.</p>
<p>Aqa Mirza Muhammad-i-Qazvini</p>
<p>O Muhammad! We have mentioned thee aforetime and at this moment, and there hath come before the Wronged One what thou didst send to My Name, the Mahdi. We answer thee again through this Tablet which hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, the Subduer of the winds. Blessed is the essence that opposition hath not prevented and the spirit that bodies have not veiled from this horizon before which, when it shone forth, the spirits prostrated themselves. And blessed is he who hath attained unto the mention of his Lord on this Day wherein the horizons have arisen in hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Aqa Mirza Abu-Talib</p>
<p>O Abu-Talib! Thou art he who hath sought the Most Exalted Goal and traversed land and sea until thou didst arrive at the Valley of the Noble One wherein was raised the call of the Glorious One: “Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Protector over what is and what hath been.” Thou wert present and beheld what was hidden from the peoples of the world and heard what the Primal Point heard. The Mother Book that is with Him beareth witness to this. Remind the servants of what thou hast seen and heard, and be so firm in the Cause that neither the veils of the divines nor the power of princes shall deter thee. Place thy trust in all matters in God, the Lord of all men. Convey My greetings to the faces of My loved ones who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and testified to that which God hath testified at the beginning and the end.</p>
<p>O Ali Ashraf! Give thanks unto God for having honored thee with this Cause whereby the hearts of the idolaters were disturbed and the hearts of the righteous were assured. We have made mention of thee and those who have believed, as a token of grace from Us. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O Aqa Bala! The Lord of creation mentioneth thee from His Most Great Prison in such wise as will draw thee nigh unto God, the One, the Peerless, the Mighty, the Forgiving. We counsel thee and those who have believed with the wisdom We have sent down through grace in the Scriptures and Tablets. Take hold of that which ye are commanded and follow not those who have violated God’s covenant and testament - they are assuredly among the wayward. Thus doth the Pen of the Most Merciful move in the arena of wisdom and utterance that ye may be drawn to a station wherein naught is seen save the signs of God, the Manifester of clear evidences. We make mention of thy brother who is named Qasim and give him glad tidings of God’s loving-kindness and grace, and counsel him with that whereby the station of man is exalted in the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>O Abdul-Khaliq! Behold and then remember when the Creator came, the creation turned away with such rejection that the clouds wailed. They turned away and denied until they pronounced judgment against Him without any proof or evidence. Set aside creation and what it possesseth, clinging to the Truth that calleth from the highest horizon of the world: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.” Most people are playing with the clay of their vain imaginings. By God! They are more contemptible than flies in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed are the people of Baha who have mounted, in His Name, the crimson ark that moveth over land and sea by His Name, the Protector over all names. Be steadfast in My Cause, speaking My praise, soaring in My atmosphere, and clinging to My robe which God, the Lord of all raiment, hath ordained. We have found from thee the fragrance of My love and have mentioned thee with a call whereby the realities of remembrance were attracted. Say: By God! The Hidden One hath appeared and those of Sinai were thunderstruck save him whom God preserved as a grace from Him and protected through the hands of power.</p>
<p>O Siyyid! The Lord of the world mentioneth thee from His Most Great Prison that thou mayest rejoice and be in a state of gladness and delight. Let not the affairs of creation sadden thee. Fix thy gaze upon the Most Exalted Horizon and hold fast to the cord of God, the Sender of rains. Say: O people of the Bayan! Associate not partners with God and dispute not about the verses whereby your faith in God, the Lord of creation, is established. Say: Set aside what ye possess and take what is with God. He verily guideth you to the straight path. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon the people of Baha who have cast aside all else, turning unto the Dayspring of lights.</p>
<p>[Karbila’i Iskandar]</p>
<p>O My Pen! Make mention of him who is named Iskandar and give him glad tidings of that which hath shone forth from the horizon of the All-Merciful as the Day-Star of utterance, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Thou hast attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen aforetime and at this hour. Beware lest anything sadden thee or the might of them that have denied the Lord of the Day of Judgment cause thee to fear. Take hold of the Book with strength from thy Lord and say: O people! Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. Behold what hath shone forth from the horizon of proof, then hearken unto that which hath been raised from the Lote-Tree of utterance: Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This is the Day whereon the Point of the Bayan crieth out, saying: O people of the realm of possibility! By My life, the world hath been honored by the lights of the Manifestation, and everyone possessed of a sense of smell perceiveth the fragrance of His perspicuous raiment. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the outpourings of your bountiful Lord or be veiled by the veils of the heedless. Blessed is the soul that hath cast the world behind it out of longing for the presence of the Ancient of Days. He is assuredly of the people of Baha in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds. We counsel all to manifest supreme steadfastness, lest the doubts of the people of the Bayan, who have exchanged the grace of God for unbelief, cause them to slip. They are indeed of them that have gone astray, as recorded in a clear tablet. We beseech God to assist thee and aid thee, that there may appear from thee that whose fragrance shall never be cut off. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Mulla ?adiq! O ?adiq! We counsel thee with supreme wisdom even as We counseled thee when thou wert standing before the door and didst hear the call of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: Wisdom is the head and master of deeds. Hold fast unto it, as bidden by an ancient Commander. Remember My days and what thou didst hear from My tongue and what thou didst witness from this most exalted horizon. Thus doth the Lord of Names command thee. Take hold and be of them that act. Let not anything prevent thee. Remind thyself, then remind the souls of the servants, that they may discover the fragrance of utterance and be of them that are assured. The days shall pass more swiftly than lightning, yet most of the people know not. Say: Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Follow the Book of God, for verily it hath been sent down in truth from His presence, and He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Say: This is the Day of remembrance, yet ye are silent. Say: This is the Day of service, yet ye are sleeping, and this is the Day of hearkening, yet ye are as dead. Blessed is the soul over which the breezes of its Lord’s will have passed, and it hath arisen saying: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the worlds and desire of them that have recognized Thee, for having awakened me and guided me unto Thy straight path.”</p>
<p>Mirza Israfil ?akim! We make mention of thee and pronounce upon thee Our blessing as a favor from Our presence, and I am verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. O Israfil! By the life of God, We have sounded the Trumpet, whereupon all who are in the heavens and earth have swooned away, save whom God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, willeth. By it earthquakes have seized the tribes of the earth, every learned one hath been perturbed, every foot hath slipped, every wise one hath lamented, every prince hath been struck with terror, every mystic hath been bewildered, and every seeing one who sought hath attained. How many a learned one hath been kept back from the Cause, and how many an ignorant one hath hastened and said: “I believe in Thee, O Thou Desire of the mystics!” How many a maidservant hath heard and turned and attained, and how many a hero hath denied and turned away from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. O Israfil! Remember thy Lord in the nights and days, and hold fast in all conditions to His firm cord.</p>
<p>Iskandar Qap</p>
<p>O Iskandar! The Lord of Power has come for the life of humanity, yet the people seized Him and imprisoned Him in this remote place. Behold and remember when the Spirit came, the divines of the Torah turned away from Him and pronounced judgment against Him unjustly - every atom cried out at this, as every fair-minded and knowing one will testify. The Comforter has come in truth, yet the people are in manifest error. You have not yet recognized Him who came to them with a sovereignty that has conquered all who are in the heavens and the earth, and with His mighty glory. I am indeed the heaven whereunto the Son of Mary ascended, as the Tongue of Grandeur bears witness, though most of the people are heedless. Give thanks unto God that He has made mention of thee while the Seat of the Throne was in a mighty prison.</p>
<p>(Iskandar Mulla-Ughli)</p>
<p>O Iskandar! Behold and remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came - the divines of the Torah and the Gospel turned away from Him. Among the people were those who denied Him, those who turned away from Him, and those who rose up to oppress Him, whereat the foundations of patience were shaken and the eyes of those near to God shed tears. The divines pronounced judgment against Him as they had pronounced judgment against the Spirit before Him. The Books of God, both past and future, bear witness to this, as doth this wronged and lonely One. When thou hast attained unto My verses and found the fragrance of My utterance, turn thy face toward God and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the Prophets and the Messengers!” I beseech Thee to make him steadfast in Thy remembrance and in the service of Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We make mention of thy brother who desired to drink from the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Generous. Give him My glad-tidings and greet him, that he may rejoice and be of those who render thanks.</p>
<p>(Haji Muhammad Mahdi)</p>
<p>O Muhammad Mahdi! The Lord of the worlds makes mention of thee as a bounty from Him, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Purify thine ear from what thou hast heard that thou mayest hearken unto the call of God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a Day wherein every confident one has been shaken, every learned one has been terrified, every silent one has cried out, and the Tongue of Grandeur has testified that sovereignty belongs to God, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: O people! Help your Lord, the Most Merciful, and be not of the heedless ones. Know then that victory has been ordained in the remembrance and utterance, even as was revealed at the beginning of this Manifestation, and most of the people are witnesses thereof. We have forbidden the servants to wage war and to contend. Among them are those who committed what We forbade and transgressed the bounds set by God, the Master of the Day of Judgment, and among them are those whom God has pardoned as a bounty from Him, for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say: Cast not the ordinances of God behind you, and do what ye are commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Those who have found the fragrances of revelation are among the most exalted of servants before God, the Hearing, the Answering. And he who is prevented is among the most lost of servants before God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>(Muhammad Hanifih)</p>
<p>We make mention of thy brother and counsel him with what befits the days of his Lord, the Master of this wondrous Day. O Pen! Make mention of him who is named Muhammad, who has drawn near to the Most Great Sea to drink and to be of the thankful ones. Say: The Day has come, yet most of the people are at ease. The Light has appeared, yet most of the people have turned away. Say: Take hold of the Book of God with the power granted by Him and cast aside that which keeps you from it. This is God’s command unto you, if ye be of those who know. If your eye causes you to stumble in this, pluck it out for love of your Lord’s Cause, the All-Merciful, the Generous. Blessed is he who has attained unto My days, recognized My path, hastened with his heart to My horizon, and arisen to serve My mighty Cause. We have made mention of thee that the remembrance might attract thee to a station wherein thou wilt recognize My clear and straight path.</p>
<p>(Aqa Mir ’Allam)</p>
<p>O Mir! The Prisoner remembereth thee from the prison-ward with that which draweth thee nigh unto God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. In the earliest days We stood before the faces of all the world, with the banners of verses on Our right and the standards of clear proofs on Our left, and We called all unto God, the Sovereign of what was and what shall be. The factions rose against Us with swords of tyranny - among them were those who claimed authority over God, and those who turned away and denied what was sent down from God, the King of Kings. Say: This is a light whereby the world is illumined, and a fire whereby are consumed the hearts of every ignorant outcast. Say: O people, judge fairly concerning that which hath appeared in truth, and follow not every veiled scholar. Thus surgeth the ocean of utterance before the face of the All-Merciful, yet most of the people understand not.</p>
<p>Aqa Mirza ’Abdu’l-’Ali - O ’Abdu’l-’Ali! The remembrance of God from the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing, before the face of the Lord of all mankind, hath verily been upraised. Blessed is he who hath heard the Call; he is indeed among the righteous recorded by the Pen of Revelation in the Book of the Exalted Ones. Say: O people of the Bayan, come ye, come ye, that He may show you God’s most sublime horizon and cause you to hear His sweetest call, at whose raising the Prophets and Messengers stood forth, crying “Yea, verily, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens!” Blessed is the eye that hath beheld the horizon of Revelation, the ear that hath heard the Call of Him Who conversed on Sinai, and the heart that hath turned to the Station illumined by the lights of His Countenance. Say: Do ye deny the ocean and its waves, the sun and its radiance? Fear ye the All-Merciful and be not of them who denied God’s grace and favors, and follow not every denier who is far from truth. Judge fairly, O people of the Bayan, concerning your Lord’s Cause. Have ye not witnessed the waves of My ocean of utterance and the effulgent lights of the sun of My wisdom’s heaven? Fear God and refute not the truth with what ye possess. Soon shall ye return to your stations and be questioned about your deeds in this world. Then shall ye find yourselves in manifest loss.</p>
<p>Karbala’i Aqa Kishi - We make mention of thy brother and beseech God to strengthen him that he may find for himself a path unto God. O thou who hast turned to the Countenance! Hear the call of the Wronged One from the prison-ward; verily He summoneth thee to a station that hath been raised up in God’s name. This is a Day wherein the Book calleth out with its most exalted voice and summoneth all to a horizon radiant with the lights of His Countenance.</p>
<p>O people! Cast aside that which keepeth you from the Lord of Destiny, Who hath come from the Source of Command with the banners of verses and with a sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. Thus moveth the Most Exalted Pen when it was between the fingers of thy Lord, that thou mayest give thanks and remain firm and steadfast in the Cause.</p>
<p>Karbala’i Aqa Dadish - O thou who art turned towards the Truth! Praise God for this Most Great Remembrance which hath guided mankind to a path raised up by God’s command. We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which hath been sent down in a Book inscribed by the Pen of Revelation in truth. Say: O peoples of the earth! Weigh what We have against what ye possess. Be fair and follow not every ignorant one who is deprived of justice. Thus have the rains of knowledge and wisdom poured down from this heaven which hath been raised up in truth, and God is witness to what I say.</p>
<p>The friends of God […]</p>
<p>Verily We make mention of the friends of God in that place, whose names have not been mentioned outwardly, and We counsel them with that which We have counseled before, for verily I am the Compassionate, the Bountiful. Take ye the Book of God as a command from Him, then recite His verses with the melodies of them that are attracted. Blessed is the servant who hath turned unto Him and attained, and woe unto them that turn aside! We counsel you to be steadfast lest your feet slip through the hints of the learned and the doubts of the babblers. These have denied God and rejected that which He hath sent down from His glorious and wondrous Kingdom.</p>
<p>Handmaidens of God: We make mention of My handmaidens there and give them glad tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all and My grace which hath encompassed all existence. We beseech God to assist them in that which He loveth and approveth, and to ordain for them that which shall gladden the eyes of the devoted ones who have attained in the early days to the recognition of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Friends of God: We make mention at this time of the friends of God in Kukachay and remind them of the verses of God, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen and hath testified to that whereunto God Himself hath testified: that there is none other God but Me, the Subduer of what was and what shall be.</p>
<p>Ismail Bey: O Ismail! The Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison and revealed for thee that which hath perfumed the world of being with the fragrance of the All-Merciful, that thou mayest rejoice and be of them that fear not, neither are they grieved. Thy name was presented before Us and We have remembered thee in this blessed and irrevocable Tablet. We have adorned thee with the ornament of remembrance, and likewise My loved ones there who have not broken God’s Covenant and His Testament, but have held fast unto the cord of their Lord’s loving providence, the Mighty, the Loving. Joy be unto you and blessed are ye for having attained unto the remembrance of God and the traces of His Most Exalted Pen, when the seat of the Throne was this glorious and forbidden station. Thus have the breezes of revelation been wafted abroad when the Tongue of Grandeur did proclaim: There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>Tiflis Friends of God: O loved ones of the All-Merciful in Tiflis! Hearken unto that which hath been raised from the right hand of the luminous spot on the crimson earth from the Divine Lote-Tree, at whose rustling all things proclaimed: The Desire of the world and the Most Great Name is come, through Whom the gates of meaning and utterance have been opened in the world of being. Exalted be God, the Creator of what was and what shall be! By God’s life! There is not a single verse but My Most Exalted Pen hath revealed it, as attesteth His preserved Tablet. Blessed be your faces for having turned, your hearts for having accepted, your eyes for having beheld, and your ears for having heard the Call of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen. Thus have We adorned the Kingdom of proof with My remembrance and the Heaven of exposition with that which My tongue hath uttered in this exalted station.</p>
<p>Aqa Baba: O Aqa Baba! The Lord of the world maketh mention of thee and giveth thee glad tidings of His turning toward thee from this station wherein the Ancient Beauty hath been imprisoned through that which the hands of the deniers of the Witness and the Witnessed have wrought. Be thou at all times observant of My most exalted horizon, attentive to My sweetest call, and take hold of My Book, at whose revelation all the books of the world have bowed down, as attesteth His inscribed Tablet.</p>
<p>Aqa Sattar: […]</p>
<p>O Concealer! The Concealer makes mention of thee from this station which hath been named by the Most Beautiful Names, and He calleth and sayeth: This is the day wherein the Mount was honored by the presence of its Interlocutor, and the Tree by its Manifestation, and the Books by their Revealer, yet most of the people understand not. By God! Every matter hath been revealed and every mystery hath emerged, and rivers of life have flowed from the rocks, yet the people perceive not. They hear the verses of God and deny them, and they behold His signs and then object to them. Say: Fear God, O people, and follow not every rejected ignorant one. Thus have We sent down the verses as a grace from Our presence that ye may give thanks unto your Lord, the Sovereign of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Aqa Mirza ’Ali - O ’Ali! Behold and then remember when We sent forth the Spirit with clear signs; the Jews and their divines rose against Him and unjustly condemned Him, whereat every stone lamented and every clod cried out and eyes shed tears. Behold and then remember the concourse of the Furqan who wept in the mosques and upon the pulpits over its letters, yet when their Lord came they slew Him unjustly - an act which erased all mention of joy and gladness from the Book of Lovers. They condemned Him Whom they had mentioned throughout ages and centuries. Thus did their souls prompt them, and today they rejoice not. They surrounded the Bird of the Most Exalted Paradise with the talons of hatred and wrought that which caused the eyes to cease their flow and the sun to withhold its radiance and the clouds their manifest outpouring. By the life of God! The people of the Bayan who turned away from the All-Merciful are more lost than any faction, more remote than any remote one, and more reprobate than any reprobate. They arose in opposition in such wise as caused the denizens of the heavenly dominion to lament.</p>
<p>Karbala’i Akbar - O Akbar! He Who holdeth dominion over destiny maketh mention of thee at a time when sorrows have encompassed Him from those who disbelieved in the All-Merciful and denied this bounty which hath shone forth from the horizon of the world and this light which hath gleamed amongst the nations. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. From His Most Exalted Pen have been sent down the secrets of what hath been and what shall be. Neither the clamor of the world nor the veils of the nations can hinder Him. He hath come with the greatest of signs and revealed what He willeth with power and sovereignty. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and refute not the truth with what ye possess, and be not of them who denied God’s proof and His testimony when He came unto the final goal. If ye deny this Revelation, by what proof can ye establish that which ye possess? Bring it forth and be not of the people of error. Fear God, O people of the Bayan, and oppose not Him through Whose command every Prophet hath spoken and every Messenger hath uttered speech. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen counsel you from its most exalted station.</p>
<p>Aqa ’Abdu’r-Ra’uf - O ’Abdu’r-Ra’uf! The Kind One calleth thee, He Who hath been imprisoned in the path of God, the Lord of lords. He it is Who arose in the earliest days before the faces of all people and summoned all unto God, the Lord of all men. Were it not for Him, the decree of the Book would not have been revealed and the Sun of Revelation would not have shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of proof. Verily, He hath come with the truth and mentioned that which He was commanded in the Tablet. Whoso believeth, it shall be to his benefit, and whoso turneth away, it shall be to his detriment. Verily He is sanctified and exalted above mention and utterance. Thus hath the ocean of My knowledge surged and the sun of My proof shone forth and the rains have poured down from the heaven of My grace.</p>
<p>Karbala’i Yusuf - O Yusuf! We made mention of thee before and make mention of thee at this time as a grace from My presence, and I am the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Say: […]</p>
<p>My God, my God! I perceive the fragrance of Thy raiment and love Thy mention and praise and nearness to the seat of Thy throne, whereon is established the temple of Thy grandeur. Ordain for me through Thy grace, O my God, that which centuries and ages cannot alter, that it may endure as long as Thy names endure and serve as a sign of Thee amongst Thy servants and creation. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and speaking Thy praise. I beseech Thee not to withhold from me the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty and the effulgences of the sun of Thy generosity. Thou art He Whom the affairs of the world cannot hinder, nor can the clamor of nations prevent. He doeth what He willeth through His power. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Akbar! Hear what the Sun speaketh, to which the Book hath borne witness: Verily there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thou hast indeed attained unto the waves of the ocean of My remembrance aforetime and the effulgences of the Luminary of My utterance, as witnessed by the Mother Book. Behold the creation and the weakness that hath encompassed them. They have cast behind their backs Him through Whose name every truth hath been manifested, turning instead to the source of vain imaginings. By God! The very atoms should weep for this Light that hath been prevented from shining forth by reason of what the hands of the wicked have wrought. They drink corruption while fleeing from the Living Waters that lie before their faces. Thus hath Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them, and they remain in doubt and schism. Neither their deeds nor their remembrance nor their turning profit them, as witnessed by all things and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. Grieve not at anything, but trust in the One, the All-Informed, throughout all days.</p>
<p>O My Name! There have come before the Wronged One the names of those mentioned by the Truthful One. We make mention of them as a grace from Us, for verily We are the Mighty, the Glorious, the Bountiful. Blessed is he and those whom he hath mentioned, and whoso hath held fast to the cords of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>O Kazim! Rejoice in My mention of thee. By God! Nothing in all creation can compare with it, as thy Lord doth testify, seated upon the throne of wisdom and utterance. Be steadfast in the Cause and speak in praise of thy Lord, detached from those who have denied the Beginning and the Return. Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto the choice wine of My utterance and the sweet waters of My mercy and My grace that have encompassed all regions. When the Standard of Revelation was raised to its loftiest station, the people denied it - some rejected it, some turned away, some objected, and some approached with sword and spear. Were We to recount what befell Us, all created things would lament and spirits would be severed from bodies. Thus have We arranged the verses in clear evidence and sent down from the heaven of knowledge that which hath attracted the hearts of the righteous.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! Hear the call of the Single One from the prison quarter. He mentioneth thee purely for the sake of God, the Revealer of verses. By God’s life! Were anyone to hearken to My sweetest call, the attraction of the verses would seize him in such wise that he would leave all created things, turning toward God, the Manifestation of clear evidences. Say: O people! Fear God and commit not what the people of the Furqan committed, nor what the Jewish divines and idolaters committed before them.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Muhammad, that he may give thanks unto his Lord, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Seeing. Praise God that thy mention hath flowed from the ocean of grace and thou hast been mentioned by the Dayspring of Certitude. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s loving kindness and say […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I have turned to Thee with my whole being. I beseech Thee by the Ark which at times soareth in the air with the wings of detachment, and at other times moveth across the land by Thy power which holdeth sway over all humanity, and traverseth the sea by Thy Name which exerciseth dominion over all who are in the heavens and on earth, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause whereby hearts have been sorely troubled and feet have stumbled. O my Lord! Deprive not Thy servants of the sweet savours of Thy days, nor keep them back from the pavilions of Thy grace which have been raised above the most exalted standards. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon My handmaidens who have believed in God, the Lord of creation. Praise be to God, the Lord of all beings.</p>

<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be [the glory of the numbers] 966 [Baha’u’llah]</p>
<p>28 Rajab 1305</p>
<p>In the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!</p>
<p>Glorified be God! The station of ears hath been so exalted as to transcend all description and mention, inasmuch as they hear at every moment the testimony of God. Likewise is the station of sight sanctified above all limitations, for it hath attained unto the vision of the Dawning-Place of verses and the Dayspring of evidences. Yet what befitteth this grace, this mercy, and this bounty! By the life of our Beloved, the most precious things of the world, its treasures and riches, both manifest and hidden, are unworthy of mention in this station. Exalted be the greatness of our Lord, and exalted His might and power! Glory be unto Thee, O Thou before Whose days the tongue is bewildered, knowing not with what mention to occupy itself in the presence of the manifestations of the light of Thy countenance. By Thy glory, O my Goal and the Goal of the world, my Beloved and the Beloved of all nations! Every eloquent one is speechless, every mature one is as a child, every mighty one is powerless, and every strong one is weak. By Thy glory! Were it not for Thy grace, nothing among all things, no mention among all mentions, and no description among all descriptions would profit me. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who illuminest the horizons of hearts with the light of Thy knowledge, to assist Thy loved ones to serve Thy Cause in such wise as would exalt Thy commandments, elevate Thy remembrance, and accomplish that which Thou hast desired through Thy grace. O Lord! Thou seest and knowest the one who hath sought Thy presence, presented himself before Thy gate, heard Thy call, turned back at Thy bidding, and held fast in Thy path to that whereby Thy mention was exalted among Thy servants and Thy creation. O Lord! Ordain for him that which will draw him nigh unto Thee in all conditions and be unto him a helper, a companion, and an intimate friend. Verily, Thou art the All-Compassionate, the Forgiving. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>Thy beloved letter dated the 24th of Rabi’u’th-Thani diffused the fragrance of reunion and truly manifested the presence of attainment unto the divine presence. This is among the greatest bounties of God, glorified be His majesty. Though outward nearness may, in accordance with consummate wisdom, remain concealed for a time, He hath opened the gates of correspondence before the faces of His servants. Though it may not completely remedy the fire of separation, yet He hath graciously bestowed such a measure of the light of reunion that the heart may not be entirely deprived of joy nor the radiance of happiness remain wholly veiled. Unto Him be praise, grace, mercy, loving-kindness, generosity, munificence, and bounty, both in the beginning and in the end. There is none other God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. After reading, beholding, and considering it, it was taken to the Most Exalted Horizon and presented before the countenance of the Lord of all beings. After complete permission was granted, the entire letter was submitted and was honored to be heard. This is what the tongue of our Lord, the All-Merciful, uttered in the Kingdom of Utterance - exalted be His utterance and sublime His proof:</p>
<p>He is the Hearer, the Answerer […]</p>
<p>Praise be to God that thou hast attained His presence and witnessed with thine outward eyes the waves of the ocean of utterance. For every moment in His presence a hundred thousand thanksgivings and praises are required, for despite the opposition of the peoples of the world, the tyranny and oppression of most nations, the prevention of hinderers and the enmity of opponents, the Hand of Power hath, through infinite means, guided thee to the Most Exalted Goal and Supreme End and caused thee to attain His presence - exalted be His dominion and great His power! The faculty of comprehension is powerless and inadequate to fathom this supreme bounty. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends of God. Say: Strive that perchance ye may quicken the dead in the valleys of heedlessness through the infinite waters of mercy flowing from the Divine Pen, and revive the withered plants. By the life of God! That which had ever been preserved and concealed within the treasury of divine protection and the repository of heavenly wisdom hath been made manifest. Hold fast to the propagation of the Cause of God. Praise be to God, thou art enkindled with the heat of His Word, adorned with its light, and aware of its manifestation and exaltation. In the nights and days thou shouldst be occupied with conquering hearts and minds through the hosts of knowledge, wisdom and utterance. With thy inner and outer tongue proclaim these words:</p>
<p>O King! O Worshipped One! O Adored One! O Beloved! Through the hands of power and the arms of might, Thou hast delivered these servants from the clay of ignorance and unknowing. Aid them to shatter the idols of vain imaginings in such wise that the imaginings of the past and the remote past, as well as the doubts of the atheists and the signs of the brayers may all be utterly dispelled, and the lights of the Sun of sanctification, detachment and transcendence may purify and illumine the world. O Merciful One! Deprive not Thy servants of the heaven of grace and ocean of bounty. With a single decree Thou canst transform fire into light, ignorance into knowledge, and tyranny into justice. Thou art He Whose power the tyranny of the polytheists and the prevention of hinderers could not prevent. O Lord of the Kingdom and Sovereign of the Realm! We are bodies before Thy countenance and dead before Thy throne. Quicken us with a new spirit and adorn us with a new attire. We beseech both the fire of Thy love and the light of Thy grace. Withhold not from Thy servants the rain-showers of the clouds of Thy mercy, nor restrain the outpourings of the heaven of Thy bounty. Thou art the Bestower, the Compassionate. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>Say: Today is the day of victory and the day of service. Through the Name of thy Lord, efface self and passion, and give the temple of fear of God its dwelling upon the throne of the heart. I swear by the Sun of Truth that the light of godliness hath ever been and shall remain a helper and supporter. We beseech God that He may purify all through deeds and qualities that are the cause of world order and the unity of nations. Well is it with them that act and woe betide the heedless. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Grace is perceivable and bounty is evident. In every word of the divine utterances, the ocean of mercy is surging, and from each of His statements, spiritual sustenance descends from the heaven of truth. I beseech God to awaken in every soul a hunger for this bounty, that all may hasten with heart and soul and attain it. This enduring gift bestows eternal spirit and everlasting life.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Although the light of utterance has encompassed all possibility and proof and evidence are manifest and brilliant at every moment, yet the deniers remain occupied with the vain imaginings of the past and are deprived of the lights of certitude. Fie upon their faithfulness! They appear exactly like the people of the past, even though those people were found to be, on the Day of Reckoning before God, the most lost, the most abject, the most unjust, and the most heedless among all the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Eyes that have witnessed the loss of the former people nevertheless cling to that path and hold fast to those vain imaginings. These immature ones of the world were not and are not worthy of mention. Where is the station of those souls and the station of the detached ones who have passed like lightning beyond all save God and consider all else absolute nothingness? These are the horsemen of this field - upon them be the blessings of God, His mercy, and His grace.</p>
<p>In all conditions, that Beloved and this servant and other loved ones must beseech God, exalted be His glory, for that which causes wisdom and awareness, that perchance those veiled and heedless souls may become aware and attain the fruit of existence. Verily our Lord, the Lord of the Throne and earth, is the All-Bountiful, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bestowing. Every knower and informed one, every learned and seeing one bears witness to His grace, His bounty, and His mercy.</p>
<p>Regarding the payment of the debts of the Blessed Leaf, the Most Exalted Leaf, upon her be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, what was written according to the command, after being presented before the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, this utterance shone forth from the Dayspring of proof, His blessed and exalted Word: […]</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be the eternal Glory of God! The Truth hath been with thee in all gatherings, homes and lands, bearing witness to thy service, thy remembrance, thy praise and thy promotion of His mighty and wondrous Cause. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to service and been accepted in the presence of the Wronged One. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this great bounty.</p>
<p>We beseech God to assist the teachers of His Cause in that which will cause the exaltation of His Word and the sanctification and glorification of His Cause. From all directions have the righteous servants sought ordinances and commandments, until there dawned from the Dayspring of His Will that which would lead to sanctification, glorification, enduring might, eternal wealth, and the exaltation and advancement of souls. For several years there was delay in its proclamation, until at last, through pure grace and bounty, it was sent forth. The law of Huquq was revealed from the Supreme Pen, although this ordinance had been recorded as a firm decree in all divine Books and inscribed by the Pen of His Will. We have commanded Our trusted ones not to demand it, for the fruit of this greatest bounty returneth unto the servants themselves. Whosoever desireth should offer it with the utmost joy and radiance. Thus hath the Lord of the worlds decreed, as a bounty from Him to all peoples. The devoted ones should fix their gaze upon the glory of God’s Cause and upon that which leadeth to its exaltation. Blessed is thy work in My path and thy proclamation of My firm and mighty Cause.</p>
<p>That which was conveyed to the Leaf of Paradise - upon her be My Glory, My Grace and My Mercy - hath been accepted before the Throne. Blessed are they that act. He who was named after the First Pillar of the two Names of his Lord hath repeatedly performed that which hath been accepted. We verily extol him from this Most Exalted Station and make mention of him as We mentioned him before. Thy Lord is verily the All-Merciful, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, thy deeds are accepted and thy efforts appreciated. Indeed, thou hast attained unto that which, when mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur, was heard by the denizens of the Kingdom, let alone those who have attained the presence and circled round the Throne. This is of God’s grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He willeth. He is verily powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Aqa Muhammad-Rida, son of the deceased one who attained and ascended - upon them both be the Glory of God. After being presented before the face of Him Who is our Purpose and the Purpose of all who are in earth and heaven, these verses shone forth from the Dayspring of Divine Knowledge. His mighty utterance, exalted be His mention:</p>
<p>Muhammad-Rida hath repeatedly been mentioned in the presence of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. Some time ago, that which perfumed the world with its fragrance was sent. We beseech God to assist him in that which befitteth His days. Verily his father attained unto that which brought solace to the eyes of wisdom and utterance. The grace of the All-Bountiful Lord encompassed him at the time of his ascension. By the life of God! The pens are powerless to make mention of him and souls are incapable of comprehending his station. Blessed be he and blessed be they that have attained.</p>
<p>As to what was written about the clamor arising after arrival - this is not the first heedlessness that has appeared, nor the first association that has emerged, nor the first transgression that has troubled the hearts of the sincere ones. The opposers should be informed that despite these evil deeds of the Shi’ih and their divines that have grieved the world of the spirit, they have again determined to establish such a party. God protect us and thee from the evil of these people. We beseech God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the throne and earth, to assist them in rending asunder the veils that have prevented them from drawing nigh unto God, the Manifestor of clear proofs. In truth, man is bewildered and the world is bewildered. The party that counted themselves the most learned and most excellent have been found to be the most lost and abject of all the peoples of the world. In all conditions we must seek divine confirmation and ask for heavenly success. Verily our Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>As to the mention thou hast made of the ascension of the two departed, blessed and cherished souls - upon them be the Glory of God and His favors - after it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these sweetest words were revealed from the tongue of the greatness of the Lord of all beings. His word - exalted be His utterance and mighty His proof:</p>
<p>He is the Forgiving, the Generous</p>
<p>O My Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of Badi’ who has ascended to the Supreme Companion in the days of God, Lord of the throne and earth, that the breathings of revelation may attract him and he may be illumined by the lights of the Luminary of his Lord’s tender mercy, the Kind, the Generous. By God! At the moment of mention there hath been sent down upon him from the heaven of grace and bounty that which the hearts of the mystics are powerless to comprehend. Rejoice, O Badi’, once again through My greatest favor. We have turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and revealed for thee that which the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise recite with myriads of them that are drawn to My call. Through My mention the ocean of bounty has surged and through My remembrance the fragrance of God, the Lord of the worlds, has wafted. Through the light of My utterance sorrows have been changed to supreme joy and smoke to the radiance of My mercy that has encompassed all in the heavens and earth. Through My acceptance the holy countenances have come forth from their chambers in the All-Highest Paradise to hearken unto this wondrous and glorious call. Blessed art thou, O Badi’! Joy be to thee, O Badi’! We congratulate thee on this supreme bounty, even as We gave thee glad tidings through My manifest remembrance. Upon thee be the Glory of God, His light, His mercy, His favors and His grace that has encompassed the world. He is verily the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>All the relatives should recite these verses and with utmost joy engage in the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory. Now in the most exalted Paradise melodies are raised and perfect, complete and supreme joy and gladness are manifest. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be My Glory and My favor! The Most Exalted Pen desires to make mention of thy brother who was named Zaynu’l-’Abidin. We testify that he attained to recognition when heedless servants denied Me, and held fast to affirmation when the manifestations of negation opposed Me, and turned to the Most Exalted Horizon when most of mankind turned away, and drank the choice wine of utterance when the peoples of the earth were forbidden it, save those whom God, the Mighty, the Bestower, pleased to exempt. Blessed art thou, O Zaynu’l-’Abidin, in that We have sent down for thee from the heaven of revelation that which the world cannot equal. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. We beseech God to send down upon thee at all times from the heaven of His grace a mercy, and from the horizon of His loving-kindness a light, and from the treasuries of His bounty that which will gladden thy heart and solace thine eyes and the eyes of the relatives who have heard and turned and responded when the call was raised from God, the Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Answerer of those who call upon Thee and Refuge of the distressed! I beseech Thee by the light of Thy countenance, by Thy sweetest call from the most exalted horizon, and by the waves of the ocean of Thy mercy, to adorn those who turn to Thee each day with the ornament of Thy grace, bounty and generosity. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. Thou art He Whose gifts are not prevented by the hosts of rejection, nor is Thy grace impeded by the gestures of those who have denied the Source and the Return. The effulgent Glory shining forth from the Dayspring of loving-kindness and favor, and the radiant Light gleaming from the horizon of might, be upon thee, O thou who believest in God and His signs, who holdest fast to the cord of His grace and cleaveth to the hem of His generosity. We give thanks to God on thy behalf and praise Him for His favor unto thee. He hath indeed purified thee at thy ascension and forgiven thee through His mercy. He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! Each of the departed hath attained that which transmuteth the sorrow of death into joy. Nay, were people to discover and perceive its fragrance, all would be filled with joy and would raise their voices in His praise and glorification. Praise be to Him in all conditions. From the beginning of the Cause until now, the glances of loving-kindness have been directed toward that beloved one and his brethren and family, upon them be the Glory of God. Who is able to thank Him as He deserveth to be thanked, or praise Him as befitteth His glory, majesty and bounty that hath encompassed all existence?</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Faran and the request for special mention of the friends of that land, after it was presented before the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, these manifest verses were revealed. His Word, exalted be His glory and universal be His bounty: “O friends of God in Faran! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He remembereth you and hath revealed for you that which shall never be exhausted throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly dominion. Ye have attained unto mentions that shall neither be erased nor perish, nor be altered by the length of ages and centuries. Rejoice in God’s loving-kindness and favor, then aid Him through His remembrance and praise and the promotion of His mighty and impregnable Cause. Preserve what ye have been given in the name of your Lord. Thus doth He command you as a token of His grace. He is the Truth, the Possessor of the visible and the unseen. Grieve not over the happenings of the world. Ye have attained unto that which none of the denizens of the Kingdom of Names have attained, save whom God hath willed, the Lord of Lords. Take ye My Book through My power. Verily it will draw you nigh and cast upon you that which will preserve you from the evil of those who have denied God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The mountains have passed away, the heaven hath been cleft asunder, the earth hath been rent, yet most of the people know not. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken in days when sorrows have encompassed it from all sides through that which the hands of every ignorant doubter have wrought.”</p>
<p>This is the Day of remembrance and utterance. Strive ye to reform the world and educate the nations, but through wisdom and utterance. Keep your gaze fixed upon this in all conditions. This is what the Wronged One hath decreed in the Scriptures and Tablets. Praise be to God! Ye have attained unto that for which ye were brought from nothingness into being. The people of the world are held back from drawing nigh by ephemeral conditions; they cling to that which they themselves testify is subject to perishing and extinction. O friends of God! Strive ye, perchance ye may succeed in performing deeds that will guide the people. Most of mankind are tormented and bewildered in the depths of vain imaginings. Perchance ye may deliver them through the name of the True One and illumine them with the light of the Sun of Truth. The names of all are mentioned and the deeds of all are witnessed. Blessed is the soul that hath attained unto that which beseemeth the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon those whom the clamor of the oppressors hath not deterred.</p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>O Khalil! Hear the call of the Glorious One. He makes mention of thee from the prison, even as He mentioned thee before, and hath revealed for thee that which hath caused the eye of utterance to be gladdened throughout all creation. Glorified be the All-Merciful Who hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compassionate, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Say: O company of the heedless! Come ye, that I may recite unto you the verses of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise. Behold, behold! By God, the ocean of divine knowledge hath surged before all faces, and the fragrance of God, the Lord of all worlds, hath been wafted. Beware lest the doubts of the world hold you back from the Most Great Name. By God, the Truth! The seal of the Choice Wine hath been broken through His Name, the Self-Subsisting. Drink ye, O people, and be not of the abject.</p>
<p>Say: Where are the Pharaohs of the earth? Where are their treasuries and their riches? Where is their might and their power and their wealth? Where are their standards and their banners? Fear God, O people, and be not of the negligent. The world itself speaketh unto you, and desireth to remind you of its changes and transformations and its evanescence. Cast away today what the people possess and take what ye are commanded by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>Say: That which hath been created on earth shall profit you not this day. To this testifieth the Book of God, the True Sovereign, the Just, the Manifest. Thus hath the Pen spoken that which hath enraptured the hearts of them that have recognized Him.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Arise to serve the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the hosts of the world nor by the oppression of the nations - a steadfastness by which the servants of the earth shall themselves stand firm. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the Expounder. Glorify those whom I love on My behalf and remind them of My verses, and acquaint them with that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty, that they may hear and be of those who render praise.</p>
<p>The glory that proceedeth from Us rest upon thee and upon those who are with thee, and upon them that have believed in God and have acted according to what hath been ordained in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>[Here follows the Tablet to Muhammad Hashim which begins: “He is the All-Hearing, the All-Answering! This is a Book which the Truth hath sent down from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting…]”</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me, and thanksgiving be unto Thee for having enabled me to recognize Thee. O Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and standing ready to serve Thy loved ones. I beseech Thee, by the hands that have been raised toward the heaven of Thy bounty, and by the hearts Thou hast made treasuries of Thy knowledge and repositories of the pearls of Thy wisdom, to aid me under all conditions to remember Thee, to glorify Thee, and to act according to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Thou, verily, art the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Then ordain for me that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and profit me. Verily, Thou art the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>This was revealed for his honor Ustad ’Ali-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>He is the One Who speaketh in the Kingdom of Utterance:</p>
<p>Glorified be God! The proof shineth like unto the sun, resplendent and manifest, and the evidence standeth clear and brilliant before the faces of the world. Nevertheless, all remain deprived and forbidden from the straight path and the mighty announcement. Though but a drop, they are far from the ocean; though but a mote, they are veiled from the sun. Today the morn of hope hath dawned and the breeze of providence hath wafted. Blessed is he who hath risen from the slumber of heedlessness and adorned himself for service. The deeds of an entire people cannot compare with a single deed performed on this day. Say: O friends! The fire of utterance is ablaze in the Tree of the All-Merciful, and the light of the Cause is shining from the horizon of grace. All must hold fast to the cord of unity and cling to the hem of concord, arising in both night and day with wisdom and utterance to that which will cause the elevation of the Cause and the upliftment of souls. This day is precious; know ye its station and act in a manner befitting thereof. Blessed art thou, O ’Ali-i-Akbar, for thou hast attained unto My mention, both before and after. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this manifest bounty and His providence which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to make thee strong through His power, steadfast in His service, soaring in the atmosphere of His love, and speaking His praise amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon the servants of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The mentioned names, together with the people of Faran, have all attained unto the remembrance of the Goal of all the worlds. Blessed are they and joy be unto them. We beseech God, our Lord and the Lord of the Throne and earth, to assist them in that which He loveth and is pleased with. Verily, He hath power over what He willeth and is worthy to answer. This servant hath ever sought and continueth to seek that which leadeth to exaltation and elevation. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for all the names of the party of God which that beloved one sent to the Most Holy Court, sacred and exalted Tablets were specifically revealed and dispatched, and likewise the answers to the petitions that were with that beloved one. Praise be to God! The Sun of providence hath risen and the Ocean of bounty is manifest. Who is that lost one whom His grace hath not sought?</p>
<p>Some time ago, a detailed letter containing divine verses and heavenly evidences was sent. God willing, it will have arrived by now. Despite the abundance of writing, of which that beloved one is aware and informed, and the lack of opportunity and scarcity of time, praise be to God, there was revealed from the heaven of providence for all that which the eye of creation hath never witnessed the like thereof. This evanescent servant beseecheth Him to educate the world through His traces and to illumine all through His lights. Mention was made of the brethren, the household, and the delight of the eyes - upon them be the Glory of God - at the supreme horizon, and these pearls appeared from the ocean of divine utterance. Blessed are they that attain!</p>
<p>His blessed and exalted Word:</p>
<p>He is the Manifest, the Speaking, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! Aforetime and now hath thy mention flowed from the Most Exalted Pen, and likewise have thy brethren attained unto His holy verses. Convey to each one of them the greetings of the Wronged One. Praise be to God that ye have drunk from the choice wine of divine love and received your portion from His utterance on the Day of His arising. This is a mighty bounty manifested and revealed by the Self-Sufficing Lord. We make mention in this station of My handmaiden and give her the glad-tidings of My mercy. We beseech God to strengthen her and enable her to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Convey My greetings unto her. Blessed is she and blessed is every maidservant who hath believed in her Lord and attained unto His verses. He is verily the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Nuru’llah, that this remembrance may strengthen him to remember Me, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Thy name hath been presented before the Wronged One, and We have revealed for thee this Luminous Tablet that joy may possess thee in the days of Him Who conversed with the Burning Bush, and draw thee nigh unto Him. He is verily the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. O Diya’u’llah! Blessed be thy name and blessed be he who named thee thus. Rejoice in My remembrance from which the fragrance of My loving-kindness, that hath encompassed all creation, is diffused. We have revealed for thee that which shall endure as long as the Kingdom endureth. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. The glory be upon thee and upon thy father and thy mother, and upon those whom neither the tempests of allusions nor the doubts of them that have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, have caused to waver.</p>
<p>O spiritual youth! Again and again do We make mention and command the loved ones of that land to convey the greetings of the Wronged One. Recite the verses of God that ears may attain unto that for which they were created and brought from nothingness into being. The name of each one hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Happy are they and joy be unto them.</p>
<p>The waves of the ocean of loving-kindness have encompassed all things, and the light of the Sun of Truth hath surrounded all. His is the praise, and His the thanks, and His the glory, and His the splendor. There is none other God but He, our Lord and the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below. Glory and remembrance and praise be upon you and upon those with you who have believed in God, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. And praise be to God, our Lord and the Lord of the exalted Throne.</p>

<p>He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of Majesty and Power</p>
<p>A praise which is exalted above every mention or</p>
<p>description beseemeth the Adored One, the</p>
<p>Possessor of all things visible and invisible, Who</p>
<p>hath enabled the Primal Point to reveal countless</p>
<p>Books and Epistles and Who, through the potency of</p>
<p>His sublime Word, hath called into being the entire creation,</p>
<p>whether of the former or more recent generations.</p>
<p>Moreover He hath in every age and cycle, in conformity</p>
<p>with His transcendent wisdom, sent forth a divine Messenger</p>
<p>to revive the dispirited and despondent souls with</p>
<p>the living waters of His utterance, One Who is indeed the</p>
<p>Expounder, the true Interpreter, inasmuch as man is unable</p>
<p>to comprehend that which hath streamed forth from</p>
<p>the Pen of Glory and is recorded in His heavenly Books.</p>
<p>Men at all times and under all conditions stand in need of</p>
<p>one to exhort them, guide them and to instruct and teach</p>
<p>them. Therefore He hath sent forth His Messengers, His</p>
<p>Prophets and chosen ones that they might acquaint the</p>
<p>people with the divine purpose underlying the revelation</p>
<p>of Books and the raising up of Messengers, and that every-</p>
<p>one may become aware of the trust of God which is latent</p>
<p>in the reality of every soul.</p>
<p>Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education</p>
<p>hath, however, deprived him of that which he doth</p>
<p>inherently possess. Through a word proceeding out of the</p>
<p>mouth of God he was called into being; by one word more</p>
<p>he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by</p>
<p>yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems</p>
<p>of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to</p>
<p>reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.</p>
<p>If any man were to meditate on that which the</p>
<p>Scriptures, sent down from the heaven of God’s holy Will,</p>
<p>have revealed, he would readily recognize that their purpose</p>
<p>is that all men shall be regarded as one soul, so that the seal</p>
<p>bearing the words ‘The Kingdom shall be God’s’ may be</p>
<p>stamped on every heart, and the light of Divine bounty, of</p>
<p>grace, and mercy may envelop all mankind. The One true</p>
<p>God, exalted be His glory, hath wished nothing for Himself.</p>
<p>The allegiance of mankind profiteth Him not, neither</p>
<p>doth its perversity harm Him. The Bird of the Realm of</p>
<p>Utterance voiceth continually this call: ’All things have I</p>
<p>willed for thee, and thee, too, for thine own sake’. If the</p>
<p>learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow</p>
<p>mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love,</p>
<p>every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning</p>
<p>of true liberty, and discover the secret of undisturbed peace</p>
<p>and absolute composure. Were the earth to attain this</p>
<p>station and be illumined with its light it could then be truly</p>
<p>said of it: ‘Thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills.’</p>
<p>Blessing and peace be upon Him through Whose</p>
<p>advent Ba??a is wreathed in smiles, and the sweet savours</p>
<p>of Whose raiment have shed fragrance upon all mankind -</p>
<p>He Who came to protect men from that which would</p>
<p>harm them in the world below. Exalted, immensely</p>
<p>exalted is His station above the glorification of all beings</p>
<p>and sanctified from the praise of the entire creation.</p>
<p>Through His advent the tabernacle of stability and order</p>
<p>was raised throughout the world and the ensign of knowledge</p>
<p>hoisted among the nations. May blessings rest also</p>
<p>upon His kindred and His companions through whom the</p>
<p>standard of the unity of God and His singleness was uplifted</p>
<p>and the banners of celestial triumph were unfurled.</p>
<p>Through them the religion of God was firmly established</p>
<p>among His creatures and His Name magnified amidst His</p>
<p>servants. I entreat Him - exalted is He - to shield His Faith</p>
<p>from the mischief of His enemies who tore away the veils,</p>
<p>rent them asunder and finally caused the banner of Islam to</p>
<p>be reversed amongst all peoples.</p>
<p>Thy letter from which the fragrance of reunion was</p>
<p>inhaled hath been received. Praised be God that following</p>
<p>the firm decree of separation, the breeze of nearness and</p>
<p>communion hath been stirred and the soil of the hearts is</p>
<p>refreshed with the waters of joy and gladness. We offer</p>
<p>thanksgiving unto God in all circumstances and cherish the</p>
<p>hope that He - exalted be His glory - may through His</p>
<p>gracious providence guide all who dwell on earth towards</p>
<p>that which is acceptable and pleasing unto Him.</p>
<p>Behold the disturbances which, for many a long year,</p>
<p>have afflicted the earth, and the perturbation that hath</p>
<p>seized its peoples. It hath either been ravaged by war, or</p>
<p>tormented by sudden and unforeseen calamities. Though</p>
<p>the world is encompassed with misery and distress, yet no</p>
<p>man hath paused to reflect what the cause or source of that</p>
<p>may be. Whenever the True Counsellor uttered a word in</p>
<p>admonishment, lo, they all denounced Him as a mover of</p>
<p>mischief and rejected His claim. How bewildering, how</p>
<p>confusing is such behaviour! No two men can be found</p>
<p>who may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united.</p>
<p>The evidences of discord and malice are apparent everywhere,</p>
<p>though all were made for harmony and union. The</p>
<p>Great Being saith: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of</p>
<p>unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as</p>
<p>strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one</p>
<p>branch. We cherish the hope that the light of justice may</p>
<p>shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. If the</p>
<p>rulers and kings of the earth, the symbols of the power of</p>
<p>God, exalted be His glory, arise and resolve to dedicate</p>
<p>themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests</p>
<p>of the whole of humanity, the reign of justice will assuredly</p>
<p>be established amongst the children of men, and the effulgence</p>
<p>of its light will envelop the whole earth. The Great</p>
<p>Being saith: The structure of world stability and order hath</p>
<p>been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the</p>
<p>twin pillars of reward and punishment. And in another</p>
<p>connection He hath uttered the following in the eloquent</p>
<p>tongue: Justice hath a mighty force at its command. It is</p>
<p>none other than reward and punishment for the deeds of</p>
<p>men. By the power of this force the tabernacle of order is</p>
<p>established throughout the world, causing the wicked to</p>
<p>restrain their natures for fear of punishment.</p>
<p>In another passage He hath written: Take heed, O concourse</p>
<p>of the rulers of the world! There is no force on</p>
<p>earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of</p>
<p>justice and wisdom. I, verily, affirm that there is not, and</p>
<p>hath never been, a host more mighty than that of justice</p>
<p>and wisdom. Blessed is the king who marcheth with the</p>
<p>ensign of wisdom unfurled before him, and the battalions</p>
<p>of justice massed in his rear. He verily is the ornament that</p>
<p>adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance of</p>
<p>security. There can be no doubt whatever that if the day-star</p>
<p>of justice, which the clouds of tyranny have obscured,</p>
<p>were to shed its light upon men, the face of the earth would</p>
<p>be completely transformed.</p>
<p>The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of</p>
<p>the peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement</p>
<p>of its peoples, hath written: The time must come</p>
<p>when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an</p>
<p>all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally</p>
<p>realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs</p>
<p>attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider</p>
<p>such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the</p>
<p>world’s Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth</p>
<p>that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the</p>
<p>tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled</p>
<p>among themselves. Should any king take up arms against</p>
<p>another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. If this</p>
<p>be done, the nations of the world will no longer require</p>
<p>any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the</p>
<p>security of their realms and of maintaining internal order</p>
<p>within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure</p>
<p>of every people, government and nation. We fain</p>
<p>would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the</p>
<p>mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of God, may</p>
<p>attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught</p>
<p>of tyranny.</p>
<p>Likewise He saith: Among the things which are conducive</p>
<p>to unity and concord and will cause the whole</p>
<p>earth to be regarded as one country is that the divers</p>
<p>languages be reduced to one language and in like manner</p>
<p>the scripts used in the world be confined to a single script.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of</p>
<p>understanding and erudition to convene a gathering and</p>
<p>through joint consultation choose one language from</p>
<p>among the varied existing languages, or create a new</p>
<p>one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>The day is approaching when all the peoples of the</p>
<p>world will have adopted one universal language and one</p>
<p>common script. When this is achieved, to whatsoever city</p>
<p>a man may journey, it shall be as if he was entering his</p>
<p>own home. These things are obligatory and absolutely</p>
<p>essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and</p>
<p>understanding to strive to translate that which hath been</p>
<p>written into reality and action.</p>
<p>In these days the tabernacle of justice hath fallen into the</p>
<p>clutches of tyranny and oppression. Beseech ye the One</p>
<p>true God - exalted be His glory - not to deprive mankind</p>
<p>of the ocean of true understanding, for were men but to</p>
<p>take heed they would readily appreciate that whatever</p>
<p>hath streamed from and is set down by the Pen of Glory is</p>
<p>even as the sun for the whole world and that therein lie the</p>
<p>welfare, security and true interests of all men; otherwise</p>
<p>the earth will be tormented by a fresh calamity every day</p>
<p>and unprecedented commotions will break out. God grant</p>
<p>that the people of the world may be graciously aided to</p>
<p>preserve the light of His loving counsels within the globe</p>
<p>of wisdom. We cherish the hope that everyone may be</p>
<p>adorned with the vesture of true wisdom, the basis of the</p>
<p>government of the world.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: The heaven of statesmanship is</p>
<p>made luminous and resplendent by the brightness of the</p>
<p>light of these blessed words which hath dawned from the</p>
<p>dayspring of the Will of God: It behoveth every ruler to</p>
<p>weigh his own being every day in the balance of equity and</p>
<p>justice and then to judge between men and counsel them to</p>
<p>do that which would direct their steps unto the path of</p>
<p>wisdom and understanding. This is the cornerstone of</p>
<p>statesmanship and the essence thereof. From these words</p>
<p>every enlightened man of wisdom will readily perceive</p>
<p>that which will foster such aims as the welfare, security and</p>
<p>protection of mankind and the safety of human lives. Were</p>
<p>men of insight to quaff their fill from the ocean of inner</p>
<p>meanings which lie enshrined in these words and become</p>
<p>acquainted therewith, they would bear witness to the</p>
<p>sublimity and the excellence of this utterance. If this lowly</p>
<p>one were to set forth that which he perceiveth, all would</p>
<p>testify unto God’s consummate wisdom. The secrets of</p>
<p>statesmanship and that of which the people are in need lie</p>
<p>enfolded within these words. This lowly servant earnestly</p>
<p>entreateth the One true God - exalted be His glory - to</p>
<p>illumine the eyes of the people of the world with the</p>
<p>splendour of the light of wisdom that they, one and all,</p>
<p>may recognize that which is indispensable in this day.</p>
<p>That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself</p>
<p>to the service of the entire human race. The Great Being</p>
<p>saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the</p>
<p>best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In</p>
<p>another passage He hath proclaimed: It is not for him to</p>
<p>pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for</p>
<p>him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one</p>
<p>country, and mankind its citizens.</p>
<p>Such exhortations to union and concord as are inscribed</p>
<p>in the Books of the Prophets by the Pen of the Most High</p>
<p>bear reference unto specific matters; not a union that would</p>
<p>lead to disunity or a concord which would create discord.</p>
<p>This is the station where measures are set unto everything, a</p>
<p>station where every deserving soul shall be given his due.</p>
<p>Well is it with them that appreciate the meaning and grasp</p>
<p>the intent of these words, and woe betide the heedless.</p>
<p>Unto this all the evidences of nature, in their very essences,</p>
<p>bear ample testimony. Every discerning man of wisdom is</p>
<p>well acquainted with that which We have mentioned, but</p>
<p>not those who have strayed far from the living fountain of fairmindedness and are roving distraught in the wilderness</p>
<p>of ignorance and blind fanaticism.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: O ye children of men! The</p>
<p>fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His</p>
<p>Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity</p>
<p>of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and</p>
<p>fellowship amongst men. Suffer it not to become a source</p>
<p>of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity. This is the</p>
<p>straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation. Whatsoever</p>
<p>is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances</p>
<p>of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the</p>
<p>revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure.</p>
<p>Our hope is that the world’s religious leaders and the rulers</p>
<p>thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age</p>
<p>and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after</p>
<p>meditating on its needs, take counsel together and, through</p>
<p>anxious and full deliberation, administer to a diseased and</p>
<p>sorely-afflicted world the remedy it requireth.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is</p>
<p>illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and</p>
<p>compassion. Take ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch</p>
<p>as consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth</p>
<p>the way, and is the bestower of understanding.</p>
<p>At the outset of every endeavour, it is incumbent to look</p>
<p>to the end of it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children</p>
<p>to studying those which will result in advantage to man,</p>
<p>will ensure his progress and elevate his rank. Thus the</p>
<p>noisome odours of lawlessness will be dispelled, and thus</p>
<p>through the high endeavours of the nation’s leaders, all will</p>
<p>live cradled, secure and in peace.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: The learned of the day must</p>
<p>direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge</p>
<p>which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the</p>
<p>generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. Such</p>
<p>academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have</p>
<p>never been and will never be of any worth. The majority</p>
<p>of Persia’s learned doctors devote all their lives to the study</p>
<p>of a philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to</p>
<p>exercise moderation in all things. Whatsoever passeth</p>
<p>beyond the limits of moderation will cease to exert a</p>
<p>beneficial influence. Consider for instance such things as</p>
<p>liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of</p>
<p>understanding may favourably regard them, they will, if</p>
<p>carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>If this point were to be expounded an elaborate explanation</p>
<p>would be required which, it is feared, might become</p>
<p>tedious. It is the ardent hope of this lowly one that God -</p>
<p>exalted be His glory - may grant all men that which is</p>
<p>good. For he who is endowed therewith is the possessor of</p>
<p>all things. The Great Being saith: The Tongue of Wisdom</p>
<p>proclaimeth: He that hath Me not is bereft of all things.</p>
<p>Turn ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else</p>
<p>but Me. I am the Sun of Wisdom and the Ocean of</p>
<p>Knowledge. I cheer the faint and revive the dead. I am the</p>
<p>guiding Light that illumineth the way. I am the royal</p>
<p>Falcon on the arm of the Almighty. I unfold the drooping</p>
<p>wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight.</p>
<p>And likewise He saith: The heaven of true understanding</p>
<p>shineth resplendent with the light of two luminaries:</p>
<p>tolerance and righteousness.</p>
<p>O my friend! Vast oceans lie enshrined within this brief</p>
<p>saying. Blessed are they who appreciate its value, drink</p>
<p>deep therefrom and grasp its meaning, and woe betide the</p>
<p>heedless. This lowly one entreateth the people of the world</p>
<p>to observe fairness, that their tender, their delicate and</p>
<p>precious hearing which hath been created to hearken unto</p>
<p>the words of wisdom may be freed from impediments and</p>
<p>from such allusions, idle fancies or vain imaginings as</p>
<p>‘cannot fatten nor appease the hunger’, so that the true</p>
<p>Counsellor may be graciously inclined to set forth that</p>
<p>which is the source of blessing for mankind and of the</p>
<p>highest good for all nations.</p>
<p>At present the light of reconciliation is dimmed in most</p>
<p>countries and its radiance extinguished while the fire of</p>
<p>strife and disorder hath been kindled and is blazing fiercely.</p>
<p>Two great powers who regard themselves as the founders</p>
<p>and leaders of civilization and the framers of constitutions</p>
<p>have risen up against the followers of the Faith associated</p>
<p>with Him Who conversed with God. Be ye warned, O</p>
<p>men of understanding. It ill beseemeth the station of man</p>
<p>to commit tyranny; rather it behoveth him to observe</p>
<p>equity and be attired with the raiment of justice under all</p>
<p>conditions. Beseech ye the One true God that He may,</p>
<p>through the power of the hand of loving kindness and</p>
<p>spiritual education, purge and purify certain souls from the</p>
<p>defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires, that they</p>
<p>may arise and unloose their tongues for the sake of God,</p>
<p>that perchance the evidences of injustice may be blotted out</p>
<p>and the splendour of the light of justice may shed its</p>
<p>radiance upon the whole world. The people are ignorant,</p>
<p>and they stand in need of those who will expound the</p>
<p>truth.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: The man of consummate learning</p>
<p>and the sage endowed with penetrating wisdom are the two</p>
<p>eyes to the body of mankind. God willing, the earth shall</p>
<p>never be deprived of these two greatest gifts. That which</p>
<p>hath been set forth and will be revealed in the future is but</p>
<p>a token of this Servant’s ardent desire to dedicate Himself</p>
<p>to the service of all the kindreds of the earth.</p>
<p>O my friend! In all circumstances one should seize upon</p>
<p>every means which will promote security and tranquillity</p>
<p>among the peoples of the world. The Great Being saith: In</p>
<p>this glorious Day whatever will purge you from corruption</p>
<p>and will lead you towards peace and composure, is indeed</p>
<p>the Straight Path.</p>
<p>Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the</p>
<p>result of the high endeavours exerted by their rulers and the</p>
<p>wise and learned amongst men, to recognize their best</p>
<p>interests. How long will humanity persist in its waywardness?</p>
<p>How long will injustice continue? How long is chaos</p>
<p>and confusion to reign amongst men? How long will</p>
<p>discord agitate the face of society?</p>
<p>This humble servant is filled with wonder, inasmuch as</p>
<p>all men are endowed with the capacity to see and hear, yet</p>
<p>we find them deprived of the privilege of using these</p>
<p>faculties. This servant hath been prompted to pen these</p>
<p>lines by virtue of the tender love he cherisheth for thee.</p>
<p>The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction,</p>
<p>and strife that divideth and afflicteth the human</p>
<p>race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions</p>
<p>and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing</p>
<p>order appeareth to be lamentably defective. I beseech God,</p>
<p>exalted be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the</p>
<p>peoples of the earth, may grant that the end of their conduct</p>
<p>may be profitable unto them, and aid them to</p>
<p>accomplish that which beseemeth their station.</p>
<p>Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and</p>
<p>the loftiness of his destiny he would manifest naught save</p>
<p>goodly character, pure deeds, and a seemly and praiseworthy</p>
<p>conduct. If the learned and wise men of goodwill</p>
<p>were to impart guidance unto the people, the whole earth</p>
<p>would be regarded as one country. Verily this is the undoubted</p>
<p>truth. This servant appealeth to every diligent and</p>
<p>enterprising soul to exert his utmost endeavour and arise to</p>
<p>rehabilitate the conditions in all regions and to quicken the</p>
<p>dead with the living waters of wisdom and utterance, by</p>
<p>virtue of the love he cherisheth for God, the One, the</p>
<p>Peerless, the Almighty, the Beneficent.</p>
<p>No man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save</p>
<p>by means of words. This showeth the significance of the</p>
<p>Word as is affirmed in all the Scriptures, whether of former</p>
<p>times or more recently. For it is through its potency and</p>
<p>animating spirit that the people of the world have attained</p>
<p>so eminent a position. Moreover words and utterances</p>
<p>should be both impressive and penetrating. However, no</p>
<p>word will be infused with these two qualities unless it be</p>
<p>uttered wholly for the sake of God and with due regard</p>
<p>unto the exigencies of the occasion and the people.</p>
<p>The Great Being saith: Human utterance is an essence</p>
<p>which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation.</p>
<p>As to its influence, this is conditional upon refinement</p>
<p>which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached</p>
<p>and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined</p>
<p>with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures</p>
<p>and Tablets.</p>
<p>Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the</p>
<p>speaker or expounder should carefully deliver his words at</p>
<p>the appropriate time and place, for the impression which</p>
<p>each word maketh is clearly evident and perceptible. The</p>
<p>Great Being saith: One word may be likened unto fire,</p>
<p>another unto light, and the influence which both exert is</p>
<p>manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of</p>
<p>wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk,</p>
<p>that the children of men may be nurtured and edified</p>
<p>thereby and may attain the ultimate goal of human existence</p>
<p>which is the station of true understanding and nobility.</p>
<p>And likewise He saith: One word is like unto springtime</p>
<p>causing the tender saplings of the rose-garden of knowledge</p>
<p>to become verdant and flourishing, while another word is</p>
<p>even as a deadly poison. It behoveth a prudent man of</p>
<p>wisdom to speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so</p>
<p>the the sweetness of his words may induce everyone to</p>
<p>attain that which befitteth man’s station.</p>
<p>O friend of mine! The Word of God is the king of</p>
<p>words and its pervasive influence is incalculable. It hath</p>
<p>ever dominated and will continue to dominate the realm of</p>
<p>being. The Great Being saith: The Word is the master key</p>
<p>for the whole world, inasmuch as through its potency the</p>
<p>doors of the hearts of men, which in reality are the doors of</p>
<p>heaven, are unlocked. No sooner had but a glimmer of its</p>
<p>effulgent splendour shone forth upon the mirror of love</p>
<p>than the blessed word ‘I am the Best-Beloved’ was reflected</p>
<p>therein. It is an ocean inexhaustible in riches, comprehending</p>
<p>all things. Every thing which can be perceived is but an</p>
<p>emanation therefrom. High, immeasurably high is this</p>
<p>sublime station, in whose shadow moveth the essence of</p>
<p>loftiness and splendour, wrapt in praise and adoration.</p>
<p>Methinks people’s sense of taste hath, alas, been sorely</p>
<p>affected by the fever of negligence and folly, for they are</p>
<p>found to be wholly unconscious and deprived of the sweetness</p>
<p>of His utterance. How regrettable indeed that man</p>
<p>should debar himself from the fruits of the tree of wisdom</p>
<p>while his days and hours pass swiftly away. Please God, the</p>
<p>hand of divine power may safeguard all mankind and direct</p>
<p>their steps towards the horizon of true understanding.</p>
<p>Verily our Lord of Mercy is the Helper, the Knowing,</p>
<p>the Wise.</p>
<p>I would like to add that thy second letter which had been</p>
<p>sent from Jerusalem hath been received and that which thou</p>
<p>hadst written and set forth therein was perused and read in</p>
<p>His presence. He bade me write as follows:</p>
<p>O Maq?ud! We have heard thy voice and perceived the</p>
<p>sighing and lamentation thou didst raise in thy longing and</p>
<p>eagerness. Praised be God! The sweet savours of love could</p>
<p>be inhaled from every word thereof. Please God, this</p>
<p>bounty may last for ever. The Servant-in-Attendance</p>
<p>recited the verses thou hast composed. Thy name is often</p>
<p>mentioned in the presence of this Wronged One and the</p>
<p>glances of Our loving kindness and compassion are directed</p>
<p>towards thee.</p>
<p>Great is the station of man. Great must also be his</p>
<p>endeavours for the rehabilitation of the world and the well-being</p>
<p>of nations. I beseech the One true God to graciously</p>
<p>confirm thee in that which beseemeth man’s station.</p>
<p>Be thou guided by wisdom under all conditions, inasmuch</p>
<p>as persons who harbour evil motives have been and</p>
<p>are still diligently engaged in intriguing. Gracious God!</p>
<p>Unto that immeasurably exalted Being Who seeketh</p>
<p>naught but to foster the spirit of love and fellowship</p>
<p>amongst men, and to revive the world and ennoble its life,</p>
<p>they have imputed such charges as the tongue and the pen</p>
<p>are ashamed to recount.</p>
<p>We have remembered thee and make mention of thee</p>
<p>now. We entreat Him - exalted is His glory - to protect</p>
<p>thee with the hands of might and power and enable thee to</p>
<p>recognize that which will serve thy best interests both in</p>
<p>this world and in the next. He is the Lord of Mankind, the</p>
<p>Possessor of the Throne on High and of the world below.</p>
<p>No God is there besides Him, the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>God grant that this Wronged One may observe fidelity.</p>
<p>He hath not forgotten nor will He ever forget thee.</p>
<p>Thou hast mentioned thine intention to stay in Damascus</p>
<p>until spring, then to proceed to Mosul, should the means be</p>
<p>forthcoming. This lowly servant entreateth God - exalted</p>
<p>is His glory - to provide such means as is deemed expedient,</p>
<p>and to aid thee. He is Potent and Powerful.</p>
<p>Although all the inhabitants of this region have been</p>
<p>treated with the utmost kindness, yet no evidence of fellowship</p>
<p>can be discerned from them. Thou shouldst observe</p>
<p>much tact and wisdom, for they seek at all times to cavil at and</p>
<p>deny the Cause. May the One true God grant them equity.</p>
<p>Concerning thine own affairs, if thou wouldst content</p>
<p>thyself with whatever might come to pass it would be</p>
<p>praiseworthy. To engage in some profession is highly commendable,</p>
<p>for when occupied with work one is less likely</p>
<p>to dwell on the unpleasant aspects of life. God willing thou</p>
<p>mayest experience joy and radiance, gladness and exultation</p>
<p>in any city or land where thou mayest happen to sojourn.</p>
<p>This lowly servant will never forget that distinguished and</p>
<p>kind friend. He hath remembered and will continue to</p>
<p>remember thee. The decree lieth with God, the Lord of all</p>
<p>worlds. I fain would hope He may vouchsafe divine assistance</p>
<p>and grant confirmation in that which is pleasing and</p>
<p>acceptable unto Him.</p>
<p>Every word of thy poetry is indeed like unto a mirror in</p>
<p>which the evidences of the devotion and love thou cherishest</p>
<p>for God and His chosen ones are reflected. Well is it with</p>
<p>thee who hast quaffed the choice wine of utterance and</p>
<p>partaken of the soft flowing stream of true knowledge.</p>
<p>Happy is he who hath drunk his fill and attained unto Him</p>
<p>and woe betide the heedless. Its perusal hath truly proved</p>
<p>highly impressive, for it was indicative of both the light of</p>
<p>reunion and the fire of separation.</p>
<p>Far be it from us to despair at any time of the incalculable</p>
<p>favours of God, for if it were His wish He could cause a</p>
<p>mere atom to be transformed into a sun and a single drop</p>
<p>into an ocean. He unlocketh thousands of doors, while man</p>
<p>is incapable of conceiving even a single one.</p>
<p>So heedless is this servant that with words such as these</p>
<p>he seeketh to vindicate the supreme power of God -</p>
<p>exalted be His glory. I implore pardon of God, the Most</p>
<p>Great, for these assertions and affirm that this servant at all</p>
<p>times recognizeth his grievous trespasses and misdeeds. He</p>
<p>entreateth remission of his sins from the ocean of the</p>
<p>forgiveness of his Lord, the Most Exalted, and beggeth for</p>
<p>that which will make him wholly devoted to God and</p>
<p>enable him to utter His praise, turn himself toward Him</p>
<p>and to put his whole trust in Him. Verily He is the Potent,</p>
<p>the Forgiving, the Merciful. Praised be God, the Almighty,</p>
<p>the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>This lowly one hath read the descriptions of the dialogue</p>
<p>with the traveller which thou hast recounted in thy letter to</p>
<p>my Lord, may my life be offered up for His sake. The</p>
<p>explanations which were set forth awaken the people from</p>
<p>the slumber of heedlessness. Indeed the actions of man</p>
<p>himself breed a profusion of satanic power. For were men</p>
<p>to abide by and observe the divine teachings, every trace of</p>
<p>evil would be banished from the face of the earth. However,</p>
<p>the widespread differences that exist among mankind and</p>
<p>the prevalence of sedition, contention, conflict and the like</p>
<p>are the primary factors which provoke the appearance of</p>
<p>the satanic spirit. Yet the Holy Spirit hath ever shunned</p>
<p>such matters. A world in which naught can be perceived</p>
<p>save strife, quarrels and corruption is bound to become the</p>
<p>seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan.</p>
<p>How vast the number of the loved and chosen ones of</p>
<p>God who have lamented and moaned by day and by night</p>
<p>that haply a sweet and fragrant breeze might blow from the</p>
<p>court of His good-pleasure and dispel altogether the loathsome</p>
<p>and foul-smelling odours from the world. However,</p>
<p>this ultimate goal could not be attained, and men were</p>
<p>deprived thereof by virtue of their evil deeds, which</p>
<p>brought upon them the retribution of God, in accordance</p>
<p>with the basic principles of His divine rule. Ours is the duty</p>
<p>to remain patient in these circumstances until relief be</p>
<p>forthcoming from God, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>Magnified be Thy Name, O Lord of all beings and</p>
<p>Desire of all created things! I beseech Thee, by the Word</p>
<p>which hath caused the Burning Bush to lift up its Voice and</p>
<p>the Rock to cry out, whereby the well-favoured have</p>
<p>hastened to attain the court of Thy presence and the pure</p>
<p>in heart the dayspring of the light of Thy countenance, and</p>
<p>by the sighing of Thy true lovers in their separation from</p>
<p>Thy chosen ones and by the lamentation of them that long</p>
<p>to behold Thy face before the dawning splendour of the</p>
<p>light of Thy Revelation, to graciously enable Thy servants</p>
<p>to recognize what Thou hast ordained for them by Thy</p>
<p>bounty and Thy grace. Prescribe for them then through</p>
<p>Thy Pen of Glory that which will direct their steps to the</p>
<p>ocean of Thy generosity and will lead them unto the living</p>
<p>waters of Thy heavenly reunion.</p>
<p>O Lord! Look not at the things they have wrought,</p>
<p>rather look unto the loftiness of Thy celestial bounty which</p>
<p>hath preceded all created things, visible and invisible. O</p>
<p>Lord! Illumine their hearts with the effulgent light of Thy</p>
<p>knowledge and brighten their eyes with the shining</p>
<p>splendour of the day-star of Thy favours.</p>
<p>I entreat Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the</p>
<p>heavens, by the blood spilt in Thy Path, and by the heads</p>
<p>carried aloft on spears for the sake of Thy love, and by the</p>
<p>souls that have melted in their separation from Thy loved</p>
<p>ones, and by the hearts broken for the exaltation of Thy</p>
<p>Word, to grant that the dwellers of Thy realm may unite</p>
<p>together in their allegiance to Thine incomparable Word</p>
<p>so that they may all acknowledge Thy unity and Thy oneness.</p>
<p>There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Most</p>
<p>Exalted, the Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>I fain would hope that He Who is the All-Sufficing, the</p>
<p>Inaccessible, may heed the solicitation of this lowly servant,</p>
<p>may attire the people of the world with the raiment of</p>
<p>goodly deeds and purge them from evil inclinations. He is</p>
<p>the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise, the All-Perceiving.</p>
<p>He heareth and seeth; He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</p>

<p>In the month of Sha’ban in the year 97</p>
<p>O Mulla Abu’l-Hasan, upon him be the Glory of God!</p>
<p>He is God - exalted be His station, the Grandeur and the Power!</p>
<p>The spirit of praise and its essence beseemeth the most holy, most exalted Court of the Beloved One, Who hath caused the living waters to flow from the fountainhead of the Supreme Pen. How many were the Alexanders of bygone ages and centuries who, with the utmost endeavor and effort, ran in search of the fountain of life but found it not. Now its seas are manifest and surging in the realm of possibility, and yet true seekers are rare to find. Until the fire of search is kindled, the door of bounty will not open. It is not strange that they failed to recognize the Beloved and knew not the Object of their desire, or that they turned not to the most exalted horizon and drank not from the living waters. What is truly strange, nay astounding, are those souls who have risen in opposition and veiled the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth with the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings. How many are the signs which they pass by, yet turn away from them in aversion! Blessed are they who have detached themselves from the world and all who dwell therein, and have turned to the everlasting Kawthar of God. Not every witless one is worthy of this station, nor is every lightless one deserving of this wine. A pure gem is needed to receive the outpourings of the All-Bountiful, and a sanctified heart is required to comprehend the virtues of this divine Day. So base have these times become that clay is taken for pearl, and darkness is set in the place of light. We observe souls who have not attained to a single letter of the Book’s knowledge, nor fathomed a single mystery of divine wisdom, yet today they are the leaders of the people and guides of the servants. They have deemed God’s binding Command as void and have considered His firm and enduring foundation as weak. What strange tyranny hath appeared in the world! The Sun of Truth is at its zenith, and the eyes of the servants are open, yet still they remain deprived and forbidden.</p>
<p>O my God, my Goal, my Worshipped One, my Creator and my Provider! Thou hearest and seest my sighs and tears in Thy days, and the burning of my heart and soul at the manifestations of Thy grace and the appearances of Thy favors, as I behold Thee wronged among Thy creation and imprisoned among Thy servants. Thou hast manifested such power and might that Thou hast made the prison land the Most Exalted Paradise for Thy loved ones, and its abasement into glory for Thy chosen ones. Thou hast informed the servants through Thy Most Exalted Pen of what hath happened and will happen in Thy lands and realms, and hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will that which tongues and pens are powerless to comprehend, and hast revealed thereby that which hath bewildered the hearts of the people of understanding from attaining unto it. Despite all this, I see them among the heedless and the sleeping, nay rather among the dead. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all being and Sovereign of the hereafter and the former times, by the light of Thy countenance and the splendor of Thy Cause, to ordain for those on earth that which will draw them nigh unto Thee and cause them to recognize Thy days which Thou hast promised them in Thy Scriptures, Thy Psalms and Thy Tablets. O Lord! Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy bounty nor from the sun of Thy grace. All things have testified to Thy power and the helplessness of Thy creation, and every tongue to Thy loftiness and wealth and the poverty of all else besides Thee. Send down upon them, O my God, from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness and the clouds of Thy mercy, that which will cause to grow from the hearts of Thy creation the flowers of Thy knowledge and the roses of Thy wisdom. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp is the kingdom of creation. There is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Almighty.</p>
<p>It is submitted to that honored and kind brother that your letter dated the 19th of Jamadiyu’th-Thani was received, and likewise another letter from you dated the 14th of Jamadiyu’l-Avval was received some time ago. Praise and glory be to God that all your correspondence is adorned with the mention of the Lord of all return, and in truth the fragrance of your love wafts from those words. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to confirm you in that which is pleasing to Him, though you have been and are already confirmed, for were it not for the confirmations of the Desired One, how could such servants as these be worthy to attain the Day of Meeting or deserve to be present at the threshold of the Lord of Names? By His very Self, the Truth, His grace has strengthened the heart and illumined the eye and caused us to attain the lights of His countenance. Were it not for His grace and favor, we would surely be among the bereft and the non-existent. At all times with a hundred thousand tongues must we give thanks, for without any deservingness He has granted that which all others are deprived of and forbidden from. Had His call not come and had the messenger of His summons not appeared, who would have attained to saying “yea” and “amen,” and had the Sun of His grace not shone, who would have found His path? A hundred thousand souls and spirits be sacrificed for the servants of His court! By the Ancient Beauty, such longings remain in the heart of this evanescent servant that he knows not which to mention. In the world of existence, he is considered less than a moth, for the brightness of the lamp so attracted it that it circles and gives its life, while this servant, after the shinings of the Sun of Truth, still remains alive. And now the time of martyrdom has passed, as all are commanded to observe the Greater Wisdom.</p>
<p>Now the time of martyrdom has passed, since all are commanded to observe supreme wisdom and are enjoined to do that which conduceth to the preservation of humanity. O brother! People observe certain words from the holy verses that have been sent down and hear reports of events that transpire. If they were truly gazing with the eye of the heart toward the Most Exalted Horizon, or were they to taste the sweetness of the utterance of the Beloved of all possibility, assuredly would the people of the earth behold that which is different from what they now witness. You and this servant, nay all the friends, must supplicate on behalf of one another, that perchance all may attain unto the ocean of His good-pleasure, for no station hath been or ever shall be more exalted than this. Should people attain unto this most exalted and glorious station, that which is now hidden from all shall be made manifest. In any case, this evanescent servant is powerless, nay forbidden, to reveal certain ranks and stations. He verily expoundeth as He willeth, and with Him is the decisive Word.</p>
<p>After perusing that which flowed from your pen, it was presented at the Most Holy Court. Then did the Kingdom of Utterance speak forth that which the Tongue of the All-Merciful did pronounce, and He, exalted be His glory, said: Write unto Abu’l-Hasan and give him glad tidings of that which hath streamed forth from the Most Great Ocean, that he may rejoice and be of them that are thankful. Thou hast testified to that which My Most Exalted Pen hath testified when the Sovereign of Names was established upon the throne that there is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Wise. Be thou assured of My grace and loving-kindness. Verily He is with whomsoever desireth Him, remembereth whoso remembereth Him, and draweth nigh unto whoso draweth nigh unto Him with a luminous countenance. O Abu’l-Hasan! Thou hast attained unto the verses of God time and again. Thy Lord is verily the All-Hearing, the Answering. God willing, may thou be adorned in all circumstances with the ornament of service to the Self-Sufficing Lord and be illumined by the effulgent lights of the sun of trustworthiness. End.</p>
<p>As per your request, this evanescent servant was honored with a special time for visitation. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to record its reward for you. Verily, He is the Protector of the doers of good and the Helper of them that turn unto Him.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote in your first letter about the house of his honor A, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah], when the friends were gathered and the holy, sacred verses that were sent were recited - blessed is the house wherein the remembrance of God is raised! The world shall soon be witnessed to be evanescent. This is a word that no soul in the world can deny. In this case, while time and opportunity remain, one must attain unto a station that is sanctified from differences and changes. Those servants who today are freed and delivered from idle fancies and vain imaginings and have attached themselves to the Truth - such souls are regarded as the most exalted of creatures in the sight of God. With utmost humility I beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive these servants of the wonders of His bounty.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about not deeming it advisable to depart due to the incomplete nature of affairs in that land - excellent is what you have done, for dealings with people must be concluded and all matters brought to completion. God willing, you are in all circumstances assisted. If you reflect a little, you will witness divine favor toward yourself. His confirmations have been and will be with you, through His grace and kindnesses.</p>
<p>In regard to what you wrote concerning the two sons of Jinab-i-Raj (upon him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah]), this servant presents these glad tidings that the favors of the True One, exalted be His glory, are abundant concerning them and those related to them. They have truly arisen to serve the Cause. We beseech the True One to confirm them in all conditions. These details were presented at the Most Holy Court, and this is what the All-Merciful revealed in response:</p>
<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>This is a Book to which all the books of the world have testified, yet most people are heedless. This is an utterance which, when it appeared from the horizon of Will, the Kingdom of Utterance bowed down before it, yet most people are asleep. This is a remembrance at whose appearance the Supreme Concourse circled round, yet people remain behind an obvious veil. By God! The Books, in their innermost tongue, give glad tidings to all in the world, saying: “The Most Great Name has appeared and with Him is the Mother Book,” yet the idolaters remain in grievous doubt.</p>
<p>O son of Ra and Jim! Rejoice that the Face hath turned toward thee from this noble station, and remembereth thee with that whose fragrance shall endure in the world. Verily thy Lord is the Bearer of Glad-Tidings, the All-Informed. The Supreme Pen hath mentioned you before your names appeared before the Throne, as a favor to your father. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Noble. We counsel you and those who have believed to show forth the Greater Steadfastness and to observe that which We counseled one of Our Branches who was named Badi’u’llah in the Book of Names and ’Ali-Muhammad in My Great Tablet. This is the Day of Rising, by the Lord of the worlds, and this is the Day of the Call and My firm and mighty Command.</p>
<p>O Ra before Jim! Upon thee be My glory! He remembereth thee in this station and counseleth thee with the wisdom which the All-Merciful hath sent down in a clear Book. None should transgress wisdom lest the clamor of the opposers be raised. Say: Hold fast unto it, as commanded by One mighty and informed. Glory be upon thee and upon thy sons and upon those who are with thee and who hearken to thy word concerning this Cause, at whose appearance all things proclaimed: “The Promise is fulfilled and the Promised One speaketh: ‘Verily there is no God but I, the Speaker, the Manifest, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.’”</p>
<p>He is the Caller between Earth and Heaven!</p>
<p>This is a remembrance whereby the eye of the Remembrance was solaced, yet most people know not. This is an utterance which, by the life of the All-Merciful, the Bayan circleth round, yet most people comprehend not. Say: By God! The Trumpet speaketh, the Balance moveth, and the Path calleth out before the Face, yet most people perceive not.</p>
<p>O Rida! Hearken unto the call of thy Most Glorious Lord. We created all things for the hearing of this Call, yet when it was raised, every heedless and veiled one turned away. I created eyes for My Day, ears for My Manifestation, and hands to grasp My sealed wine, which is My preserved Book. Blessed art thou for having drunk from the Spring of Life when the All-Merciful came with manifest sovereignty. We send greetings from this station to thy father and thy brothers who have taken the Kawthar of utterance in the name of the Lord of Religions and have drunk thereof through My beloved remembrance.</p>
<p>From these holy, revealed, and blessed verses, the favor of the True One is evident and clear, and this evanescent servant also conveys his greetings to each one. May they dwell and find rest beneath the eternal Lote-Tree and remain occupied with the remembrance of the True One, exalted be His glory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about the Handmaidens of God, it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Threshold. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur in this station - exalted be His glory: God willing, may the handmaidens of Truth be occupied with His remembrance and praise throughout the nights and days. O Abu’l-Hasan! Once God, exalted be His glory, spoke to the Son of Mary saying: “O My servant and son of My handmaiden.” Reflect, then give thanks to thy Lord, the Generous Bestower. Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the handmaidens of God and likewise to all other maidservants of God who dwell in that land. God willing, may all, in utmost sanctity and detachment, be engaged in the remembrance of the Goal of all the world. How many men who counted themselves among the learned and accomplished are seen to be deprived, while how many servants and women who had not seen a letter of knowledge have attained the ocean of knowledge and speak the words “Thine be the praise, O God of all worlds.”</p>
<p>Concerning what was written about Mosul, He said: It would have been better had they heeded the glad-tidings and “give thou good news to the patient ones” after the blessed words “We shall surely try you.” Although famine has overtaken most lands this year, yet the spreading of such matters by the friends may cause certain incidents. The mention and spreading of such matters must in all cases occur with permission. He indeed knoweth His servants better than they know themselves. He is the Single One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>And whosoever desires with complete willingness and yearning to pay the Huququ’llah must give it to such as your honor and the trustees and obtain a receipt, so that whatever occurs may occur with the leave and permission of God. He is verily the Teacher, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written that his honor ’Ayn [charged with] 966 [Baha’u’llah] had designated funds for that land - they have always been and continue to be confirmed. We beseech God - our Beloved and your Beloved, our Goal and your Goal - to aid us in manifesting that which will exalt His Cause and in spreading that which will elevate His remembrance. He is verily the Self-Sufficient, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Concerning what was written “I have no desire save His good-pleasure,” He said: This is the most exalted of stations. Blessed is the soul that has drunk from this cup which God has placed above the seas in station. God willing, may you ever attain unto it. It is better for thee and for My servants than whatsoever hath been created on earth.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about his honor Aqa Mirza Asadu’llah from Alif and Shin, it was presented and He said: O Asad! We have mentioned thee before, and I am the All-Knowing Rememberer. Strive in that which befitteth these days which were the hope of the sincere ones. Whoso hath recognized this Day hath attained unto that which God hath decreed in His Mighty Book. Convey My greetings to My loved ones in Alif and Shin. We have remembered them and greeted their faces from this exalted station. For thee and for them to hold fast unto spiritual qualities and pleasing deeds and that whereby this mighty Cause may be exalted. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>And concerning what was written about the intention to travel to the land of Ha and Mim, it was presented at the Most Holy and Exalted Threshold. Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur when the Beloved of the world was established upon the throne of His Most Great Name. He said, exalted be His glory […]</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! When thou enterest the Land of Ha and findest its fragrance, convey My greetings to My loved ones therein, who have cast aside all else save Me and have taken what was revealed in My Book, and have drunk the choice wine of faithfulness from the hand of My bounty, and have turned with radiant faces toward the horizon of My grace. These are servants whom the rapture of the call of God hath so seized that they have spoken in His praise and remembrance, and have uttered that which they were bidden in a perspicuous Tablet. We make mention of the traveler in this station, who turned toward My countenance and attained My presence when the Luminary of My Cause was shining from the horizon of Zawra. We bear witness that he hath acknowledged that which God had testified to on a Day whereon feet did slip. O Tongue of Grandeur! Make mention of him who was named with the letters Ba and Qaf, who remained faithful to the Covenant on a Day wherein necks were humbled before God, the Lord of all horizons. Hearken once again unto My call. Verily, He remembereth thee with that which nothing on earth can equal, as doth testify He with Whom is the Mother Book. Thy letter which thou didst send before, and another letter, have been received and have attained the Most Great Presence, the station wherein the Lord of Destiny proclaimeth: “There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.” Blessed art thou for having been moved by the stirring of God’s verses in His days and for having arisen to serve the Cause with spirit and fragrance. We have made mention of thee in numerous Tablets with such mention as shall never cease to perfume the world. To this doth bear witness the Wronged One Who is imprisoned in the Most Great […]</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! Gladden and adorn the friends in that land with the ornament of a wondrous and sublime remembrance from before the True One. With utmost joy and delight, turn towards and traverse the dominions of the All-Merciful. Two petitions from the names B and Q reached the Court of the Intended One and attained an exalted station. God willing, through divine favors they shall in all conditions be occupied with the mention of the Friend and service to His Cause with wisdom and utterance, and shall at all times partake and give others to partake of the Kawthar of divine love. No matter hath ever been or ever shall be hidden before the Throne. Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Upon Him be My glory and the glory of those who circle round My Throne, and upon the Steed that turned towards the Supreme Horizon until it entered Baghdad and attained the presence of the Lord of Names and drank the choice wine of revelation from the hands of its Lord, the All-Merciful. Say unto them: Grieve not, but trust in God in all matters. Verily He is with you and will manifest what He willeth. He is indeed the Munificent Bestower. If thou shouldst see Kamalu’d-Din, gladden him with My loving-kindness and bounty, and remind him of what We commanded him when he was present before Us. Say: O Kamal! We counseled thee to render all thy submission and humility unto God alone. Hast thou forgotten? Ask God, thy Lord, to assist thee to act according to that which thou wast bidden by the Revealer of the Book. We have mentioned thee in such wise as all the Books bear witness, and beyond them My Tongue, and beyond that My Most Exalted Pen in the Scriptures and Tablets. Verily thy Lord is with thee, He heareth thy call and seeth what appeareth in the kingdom. He is indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We make mention in this station of Our servant An-Nur who drank from the ocean of My presence and attained the honor of hearing My call in the earliest days. Glory be upon thee and upon him and upon those related to thee and upon My handmaiden who attained the presence and won that which most men were debarred from. O Kamal! Hearken with thine inner ear to the call of the Beloved of the world. Act according to what He hath commanded. Thou art among those souls who have been and are mentioned before the Throne. Know thou the value of this station. I swear by the dust of the Most Great Prison which hath been made the footstool of the Lord of eternity - were the station of a single soul illumined by the lights of the Divine Word to be made manifest to the dwellers of earth and heaven, thou wouldst behold them all bewildered, nay most of them struck dead. O My Pen! Make mention of Al-Mahmud who turned towards the Praiseworthy Station and attained, ere the Manifestation, the Dawning-Place of Light, and believed in God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. O Mahmud! Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in the land of exile. We thank God for what hath come upon Us in the prison-city of Ta and in this mighty prison. When tribulation increaseth, the chosen ones increase in their love for God, the Lord of all beings. Thus doth the Lord of the Throne and of earth instruct thee that thou mayest be among the thankful. Blessed is the soul that hath borne hardships and difficulties in the path of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. We give thee glad tidings of the greatest ease after thy severest hardship. Rejoice and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the worlds! O Mahmud! None hath fathomed the mysteries of divine wisdom. Had the people of the earth acted according to the counsels of their celestial Beloved, thou wouldst have beheld the entire earth as the most exalted Paradise, and all would have attained complete freedom and perfect tranquility. Say […]</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Thou at Whose Name the limbs of the mighty have quaked and the mountains have crumbled! I beseech Thee by Thy Hidden Name, which was established upon the Throne of Manifestation on this Day whereon the Trump was blown and the decree of resurrection appeared, to enable me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee in such wise that neither the hosts of the earth nor the mighty ones among Thy creatures shall prevent me. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee, clinging to the cord of obedience unto Thee, and holding fast to the hem of Thy generosity. Ordain for me that which is best for me, and prescribe for me that which shall profit me in every world of Thy worlds. Thou knowest what profiteth me, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Self to deliver whosoever is imprisoned in Thy days and aid him to that which Thou lovest and art pleased with. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>The Ancient Beauty hath turned towards the wise ones in Ha and Mim and giveth them glad tidings of the Ridvan of God, the Lord of the worlds. Rejoice ye in that the One seated upon the Throne maketh mention of you in such wise that those near unto God perceive therefrom the fragrance of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. I swear by God! He Who was named Jehovah in the Torah, and the Comforter in the Gospel, and in the Qur’an as the Great News, hath come - He at Whose appearance the heaven of vain imaginings was rent asunder, the earth of idle fancies was cleft, and all who dwell on earth were terror-stricken, save such as God pleased, the Most High, the All-Knowing. Blessed are ye for having turned unto the Countenance, and joy be unto you for having attained unto this glorious station. Beware lest the affairs of men grieve you. Hold ye fast unto the truth - verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O concourse of the wise ones in the land of Ha! The Most Exalted Pen declareth: This is the Day of remembrance and praise, and this is the Day for the manifestation of praiseworthy attributes. God willing, ye should give the thirsty to drink from the Euphrates of the Most Merciful’s mercy, and guide the wanderers to their true home. With utmost joy and fragrance, give the glad tidings of the Merciful’s bounty to all beings, and arise to serve with wisdom. Whatsoever appeareth from any doer of good deeds in this day shall be observed as a star in the heaven of divine knowledge. By the truth of His own Self! Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Drink ye in the name of the True Friend, speak ye in His Name, and be enkindled with His love - an enkindlement whose effects shall become manifest in the world. This is not difficult for the Almighty. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the One, the Peerless. Those souls among you who are engaged in teaching the Cause are mentioned before the Throne and are specially favored with God’s grace.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! Though some names were not mentioned outwardly, yet all are recorded and inscribed in the Preserved Tablet by the Most Exalted Pen, especially those souls who have arisen with complete dedication to teach and serve the Cause. Upon them be My glory, My mercy, and My bounty, which have preceded all worlds. Soon shall appear in the kingdom what they have wrought in My path. It behooveth them to rejoice in this mention, from which the fragrance of the essence of their Lord’s bounty hath been wafted. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>From the precincts of the Prison, We send Our glorification upon the loved ones of God in Nun and Ra, both men and women, who have fulfilled God’s Covenant and have turned unto His luminous Countenance. O My loved ones in that land! There have come before the Wronged One the pages adorned with My mention and praise, and We have answered you as a bounty from Our presence. Verily, He is the Near One, the Answerer. Rejoice ye in My mention of you and trust in all affairs to the One, the All-Informed. Verily, He ordaineth for His loved ones that which shall profit them in His worlds. He is verily the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth through His name, the All-Wise. Verily, in the Prison He maketh mention of you in such wise as to attract the hearts of the sincere ones. Glory be upon you and upon those who have cast away vain imaginings behind their backs, turning unto God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Hasan! We have heard the call of the Noble One in the land of Ta before, and We make mention of him with a tongue through which the horizons were set ablaze and through which the Lord of the Day of the Covenant spoke: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Lord of Lords!” We made mention of him before, and We make mention of him at this time, that he may rejoice in the remembrance of God, the Revealer of Verses. Convey My greetings unto him and give him the glad-tidings of this remembrance which God has made the King of all remembrance. The glory from Us be upon him and upon those who have attained to the mention of this station.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whenever you meet the friends of God in any city or region, make mention of this evanescent one’s utter powerlessness and nothingness. God willing, may they at all times drink from the chalice of the Merciful’s love and be turned with their entire sight, hearing and soul toward the Most Exalted Horizon. This is the tree of goodness, and its fruit and leaves. God is witness that this servant does not consider himself worthy or deserving of mention in the presence of those friends who have caused their own will, desire and choice to become extinct and non-existent in the will and desire of God. Blessed is the soul that acts in accordance with that which it has been commanded in the Book of God - that is, the soul that outwardly is adorned and embellished with prescribed deeds, for it is observed that some interpret divine verses according to their own vain imaginings and continue to do so. Evil is that which they do.</p>
<p>The name of his honor the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, is oft-mentioned, for he has been and continues to be mentioned in every letter, and this servant has made mention of him in all correspondence, but it seems he himself has not yet written from his location. In any case, wherever he may be, may he be occupied with the mention of God and be engaged in that which He loves and with which He is well-pleased. God willing, may he attain to His presence and be blessed once again with His meeting. The Glory be upon you and upon him and upon those who are adorned with the attributes which the Revealer of Verses has sent down in His Mighty Book.</p>
<p>=== END BH00141 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00142 ===</p>
<p>He is our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. Those who have acted unjustly are such servants as shall be seized by the breezes of chastisement from all directions - a command from His presence. And He is God, our Lord and the Lord of all things, our Goal and the Goal of all who are in earth and heaven.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Kings and the Merciful unto the servants! Thou beholdest Thy loved ones beneath the talons of hatred, and hearest their sighing from the land of ?a and other regions. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued all names, to aid Thy chosen ones to be patient and forbearing. Then protect them with Thy hosts, O Thou in Whose grasp lieth the Kingdom of destiny.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest what hath befallen them and hearest their crying and lamenting, and knowest what they desire in manifesting Thy Cause, reforming Thy lands, and displaying Thy bounty, generosity and grace amongst Thy creatures. O Lord! I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy utterance and the suns in the heaven of Thy certitude, to preserve them and aid them, and to inscribe for them from Thy Most Exalted Pen Thy most excellent Word, whereby the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure is diffused and every sincere one findeth the sweet savors of the garment of Thy loving-kindness.</p>
<p>Thou art He Who cannot be described by the descriptions of the world nor by what floweth from the Pen. Thou hast ever been sanctified above mention and utterance, and above the heights of knowledge and explanation. All realities have confessed their powerlessness, and all books have acknowledged their shortcoming. Can any horseman of utterance gallop in the arena of Thy knowledge, or range the wilderness of Thy handiwork? Nay, by Thy Most Exalted Self and the Sovereign of Names! Thou hast ever been self-sufficient in Thine own essence and mighty through Thy power and authority.</p>
<p>O Lord! Thou seest how the weak one hath clung to the cord of Thy strength, and the lowly one hath held fast to the hem of the robe of Thy glory. I beseech Thee by my soul which hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance in Thy presence and clothed with the garment of humility before the gate of Thy grandeur, to deliver Thy loved ones and chosen ones from the oppression of Thine enemies. Then pour forth upon them patience through Thy bounty and grace, for tribulation in Thy love, O Lord of Names, is sweeter than all sweetness and more glorious than all things. Soon shall the idolaters and the heedless behold their loss from their deeds, and the sincere shall witness that which the Pen is powerless to manifest, mention and describe.</p>
<p>O Lord! Illumine the eyes of Thy creation that they may behold what they have neglected at the dawning of the lights of Thy Manifestation. Although, O my God, they have done that which hath not cut them off from the breezes of Thy most great bounty and the fragrances of Thy compassion and loving-kindness, yet, O my God, my Master, my Goal and my Hope, when Thou didst show me the oceans of Thy mercy and the heavens of Thy gifts, my hope and yearning increased. I beseech Thee not to deprive Thy servants from that which Thou hast manifested through Thy bounty, nor to withhold them from the waves of the ocean of Thy Manifestation. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest and the Sovereign over what Thou desirest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>And I pray and send greetings upon the Dawning-Places of Thy Cause, the Day-Springs of Thy wisdom, and the Manifestations of Thy Self, O Lord of Names and Creator of Heaven, those who have cast away their desires and followed that which they were commanded by the decree of Thy Cause, and through whom Thou hast manifested what Thou didst will by Thy might and power. Verily Thou art God, the Lord of the worlds, the Goal of those near unto Thee, and the Ultimate Hope of the sincere ones.</p>
<p>In the Name of Him through Whom surged the ocean of mysteries!</p>
<p>And further: The servant hath received the traces of thy pen, from which wafteth what proclaimeth in the most exalted call thy sincerity, thy love, and thy rising to serve the Cause of God - our Purpose and thy Purpose, our Beloved and thy Beloved, and the Object of worship of all who are in the heavens and on earth. When I read and understood it, I soared on wings of longing unto the Lord of the Day of Meeting. When I was present, I laid bare what was in thy letter, whereupon the tongue of the All-Merciful spoke forth in the Kingdom of utterance that which caused all things to attain unto the Kawthar of divine knowledge. He said, exalted be His glory: […]</p>
<p>O thou who hast turned toward the dominion of My Cause! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One at this time when sorrows have encompassed Him through those who have disbelieved in the All-Merciful and violated the Covenant of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. The divines of the age have pronounced their verdict against My loved ones and chosen ones. God hath seized their leader - He, verily, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. Yet the idolaters remained heedless of this. He seized another - He, verily, is powerful over whatsoever He willeth and in His grasp are the reins of all things. Such heedlessness hath overtaken them that they have denied God and His proof, and they comprehend not. They enter the mosques in My name, yet they pronounce judgment against My Self and perceive it not. They occupy the highest seats in the world in My name, yet they deny Me that which was created for My servants. Thus have vain imaginings and idle fancies seized them. Thou hearest from their tongues My mention and praise, yet thou seest their tears and sighs at My commandments and ordinances. When the Dayspring of wisdom and Dawning-place of the Cause appeared, they disbelieved in Him and rose against Him with such tyranny as caused the Temple of Grandeur to lament upon the throne of His name, the Self-Subsisting. By My life! Were it not for God’s pre-existing decree, We would have shown them who is mightier and more powerful. But We have been patient until God manifests what He desireth. Verily, He is the Powerful over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
<p>Look not upon the power of the enemies and the fire of their souls. Rather, consider the former ages and what was manifested of thy Lord’s might, the Ruler of the seen and unseen. Verily, We see them as children playing with clay, and they know it not. Say: O thou ignorant scholar! By what proof didst thou believe in God’s previous Manifestations, and by what evidence dost thou turn away from Him Who hath come unto thee with what equalleth all the Books of God? Be fair, O heedless outcast! By God! Thou hast pronounced judgment against Him around Whom circle the Concourse on High and near-stationed servants. Say: O company of the ignorant! Fear God and oppose not Him Who hath come from the Dayspring of power with the standards of verses, and hath revealed what was hidden in knowledge and recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of existence. Say: All things lament because of your tyranny, while ye sport with your own selves and perceive it not. Say: O concourse of divines! Where is he who was named Abdul-Husayn who rose against his Lord in Iraq and denied His favor after its bestowal? And where is he who was named Sadiq in the land of Ta who was denounced as a liar by the All-Merciful in a Book that was sealed with the seal of the Cause and preserved in His hidden knowledge? And where is the leader of the people in the land of Sad whose tyranny caused the dwellers of the realms of might to lament, and those who circle round God’s kingdom, the Mighty, the Loving? When he disbelieved and transgressed and turned away and rebelled, God seized him with such a chastisement as the eye of creation had never seen its like. Thus was his fate sealed, as was the fate of those who tyrannized God’s loved ones without clear proof or manifest command. Soon shall the fate be sealed of those who have arisen in oppression and opposition, in such wise as to shake the pillars of the Cause and extinguish the light of God, the Mighty, the Witnessed.</p>
<p>O thou who gazest upon the Countenance! We desired the glory of the world, while they desired My harm and abasement. We have manifested Ourself to reform My lands and realms, while they have risen in opposition and desired to destroy this most mighty and impregnable edifice. Say: Fear God and transgress not your bounds.</p>
<p>Do not transgress your stations and your bounds. Verily He hath come with a power that cannot be hindered by the weapons of the world nor the armies of nations, if ye but knew. Thus hath shone forth the Luminary of utterance from the horizon of proof. Turn unto Him, O My friends in the land of Ta and round about it, then turn with illumined hearts and say: “Hallowed and holy is the Lord of the angels and the Spirit!” The Glory shining from the horizon of My Kingdom and the Light manifest from the heaven of My dominion be upon My friends and chosen ones who have aided My Cause and arisen to serve Me, in such wise that the Ancient King hath made mention of them in His inscribed Tablet.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! The verses have been sent down and the evidences have appeared, and the ocean of loving-kindness hath revealed the pearls of its favors unto His loved ones. Blessed is the soul that hath attained and the eye that hath beheld. What tongue or utterance could be worthy to mention this boundless grace that was and is. This evanescent servant, whenever he witnesseth the outpourings of the ocean of grace, riseth up on behalf of all to offer praise and thanksgiving to the Beloved of the worlds. Such is the measure of grace - and God is witness and aware - that the very ocean of grace hath appeared and the sun of loving-kindness is manifest, yet most remain heedless and veiled. The people are heedless; were they to know, they would sacrifice themselves in His straight path, His mighty way, and for His Ancient and Glorious Beauty. The deeds of the people of the world have occupied them with ornaments and colors that after two days shall become the portion of their enemies.</p>
<p>I heard with mine own ears from the tongue of my Lord at a certain time - and His word is the truth - saying: “O thou who art present! A single effulgence from the Sun of detachment shone forth upon one of the kings of the world. He became somewhat awakened and after his awakening uttered these words: ‘There is no good in what I possess today, for tomorrow another shall possess it.’ Thereafter he withdrew from his royal throne and, mindful, departed to distant lands. In truth, he fled from vipers, scorpions and beasts of prey, and afterwards none found him. The ministers and nobles searched extensively but found him not.” And He said: “Were but one effulgence to shine upon all the people of the world, all would act as he acted. However, God doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>As to what you wrote - the Divine Tablets arrived and both the physical and spiritual eyes were illumined by their light. They were read in the house of Jinab-i-Na?ir, upon him be the Glory of God, where Jinab-i-Aqa Mirza Mihdi and a group of the friends of God, upon them be the Glory of God, were present. Likewise, copies were sent to the friends, as well as the Tablets specifically meant for various regions, after which the originals were dispatched. All these matters, which in truth constitute true teaching, were presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Court. This is what the Kingdom of Utterance hath spoken, exalted be His glory:</p>
<p>O Nabil! Blessed is the land that hath been honored by the footsteps of the people of truth, and blessed is the house wherein the mention of the chosen ones hath been raised, and blessed is the tongue that hath arisen to teach the Cause. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to that which is befitting. Teach the Cause of thy Lord, then make mention of Him in the nights and days, and attract hearts through His Name, the Mighty, the Beloved. Verily, He thanketh thee. Rejoice and be of those who are steadfast. Blessed is he who hath been named Mihdi and those who were present and heard the verses of God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to assist those who have attained to His recognition in His days and have found the sweetness of His utterance. These are among the Concourse on High in the Book of Names. Upon them be the Glory of God, the Creator of the heavens.</p>
<p>Today the spreading of the Sacred Writings through wisdom and utterance is the greatest of deeds. A hundred thousand blessings upon him who has taught and teaches the Cause of God. There has never been any doubt that the purpose of creation is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory, and this most great matter and ultimate goal cannot be achieved except through teaching and spreading the Sacred Writings. The servant beseeches God, the Most High, to assist His loved ones in all regions to accomplish that which He loves and with which He is pleased.</p>
<p>Concerning what you wrote about that soul upon whom be the Glory of God, His grace and His mercy - God is witness and testifier that this servant and the other friends beseech God, exalted be His glory, to strengthen him and adorn him with the ornament of righteous deeds. His father is mentioned among the assured ones in the Book of God. Blessed is he, blessed is he! However, that beloved one should observe that certain matters must be concealed from those who have extensive dealings with outsiders, for it often happens that they mention without any ill intent or agreement what they have heard, and this becomes the cause of incidents. The people of truth must be educated with wisdom so that such mention and deeds that cause enmity and discord among the people of the world do not become manifest. Let all act according to that which they are commanded and speak that which they are permitted.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Mirza-yi-Bahar, upon whom be the grace of God - Aqa Mirza Mehdi, upon whom be the Glory of God, has mentioned him and likewise sent a leaf regarding his thoughts’ denial. This ephemeral one also submitted a response which was sent. God willing, may he be assisted to do what is befitting. These are days of tranquility, joy and gladness. I earnestly beseech God that He may assist all in such wise that neither the might of the people of the world nor the oppression of nations may prevent them from God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>Concerning your mention of Master Sh, Mashhadi J B, Haji M H, and Aqa F R, upon them be the Glory of God - this was submitted in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, and the waves of the sea of grace were manifest and evident toward each one. Likewise, all the friends of that land are illumined by the lights of the Sun of the Lord’s favors, for each has attained to the mention of the Beloved. Happy are they and blessed are they! This ephemeral one also extends to each his utter nothingness and submission, and beseeches God for unity and concord among those assured and steadfast souls. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to protect them from the evil of those who have arisen to extinguish His light and quench His fire. Verily, He has power over all things.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote that Mirza M H Kh A, upon him be the Glory of God, had requested a special Tablet for his brother - this matter was submitted and, praise be to God, was granted. However, your honor should consider whether it accords with wisdom to give it. A Tablet was also revealed and sent specifically for Mirza —, upon him be the Glory of God. God willing, may he attain unto it. Likewise, two Most Holy and Most Exalted Tablets have appeared from the Dayspring of grace specifically for two souls - Mirza 32 Kabir and Muhammad-Qabl-S, upon them be the Glory of God. God willing, may they attain unto them and drink from the ocean of the utterance of the All-Merciful. This is what hath appeared from the Kingdom of Utterance for him who is named Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger […]</p>
<p>The dwellers of My celestial dominion have lamented at what hath befallen My loved ones who make mention of God at morn and eventide and who desire naught but the betterment of the nations of the world. To this beareth witness the Lord of eternity from a station wherein the sun of grace hath shone forth and the atoms testify that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Countenance when the ignorant ones of the earth turned away from it - nay, they understand not. The horizon of the heaven of My Hidden Name hath been illumined, yet the people perceive it not. They have violated their Covenant and cast behind them their Pledge until they disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed throughout ages and centuries. Say: O concourse of earth! He Who was promised in the Books of God hath appeared. Fear ye the All-Merciful and follow not every heedless and veiled one. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee, given thee knowledge and established thee before a gate that hath been opened unto all who are in earth and heaven. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Kind. Cast aside the imaginings of men and take fast hold of the hem of certitude. Thus doth He Who testifieth at every moment that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving, command thee. Stand firm in the Cause and make mention of thy Lord at eventide and at dawn.</p>
<p>This is what hath appeared from the dominion of utterance to Mirza Abu’l-Qasim. His word, exalted be His majesty:</p>
<p>In His Name, the One Who ruleth over earth and heaven!</p>
<p>A letter hath come before the Wronged One wherein was thy mention. We have mentioned thee with a mention that cannot be equalled by the mentions of nations nor the treasures of the world. To this testifieth He with Whom is a perspicuous Book. The standards have been raised, the verses sent down, and the evidences made manifest, yet most of the people remain heedless. They have cast the Cause of God behind their backs - verily they are among the abject ones. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention when the people gathered to extinguish the light of God amongst His creation. Say: By God! The hands of Caesars and Pharaohs have fallen short. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. The Will of God hath prevailed over the will of His creation, and His Purpose hath preceded the purpose of all who are in the heavens and the earth. No mention can stand before His mention, nor any command before His command. Did Pharaoh prevail or God, the Powerful, the Mighty? Beware lest the conditions of the ignorant prevent thee from the Lord of Names, or the clamor of those on earth from this Great Announcement. Rejoice in My mention of thee, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the heaven of My Hidden Name with the luminary of wisdom and utterance. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>This is what hath shone forth from the horizon of Will to him who was named Muhammad-’Ali. His word, blessed and exalted be He:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who calleth between earth and heaven!</p>
<p>The oppressors have done what their fathers did before - nay, they understand not. They slay My loved ones yet lament over what befell My Names aforetime. What aileth them that they are not awakened by the Call of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be? They have secluded themselves with idols, yet they perceive it not. Their ranks and their thousands and their ornaments have deceived them to such extent that they have cast behind them He Who created them by His command “Be, and it is.” Soon shall their ranks curse them and their ornaments disavow them - this hath been irrevocably decreed by God, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Rejoice in your vain dominion; soon shall ye lament as lamenteth the bereaved. To this testifieth He with Whom is a Hidden Book. Grieve not over what the hands of the servants have wrought. Give thanks unto God Who hath mentioned thee from His praiseworthy station. Take the chalice of steadfastness in the name of the Lord of creation, then drink therefrom in His Name, the Manifest, the Renowned.</p>
<p>In His Name, the Remembering, the All-Knowing!</p>
<p>This is what hath shone forth and appeared from the horizon of grace unto him who was named Sadiq. His glory be exalted!</p>
<p>O Sadiq! On this day, whosoever hath turned unto the Most Exalted Horizon and attained unto the recognition of God, exalted be His glory, he verily hath been and is truthful. If one attaineth not unto this station, though he speak with truthfulness from time immemorial unto time everlasting, he shall not be reckoned among the truthful in the sight of God. Give thanks unto the Desired One of all the worlds and be thou engaged in His praise, inasmuch as the rays of the Sun of Truth have shone upon thee and guided thee unto the straight path. Throughout all ages and centuries, the enemies have striven to extinguish the divine light and quench the fire of the divine Lote-Tree, and have expended their efforts to this end. But God hath driven them away by His command and manifested that which He desired through His mighty and wondrous Word. Were the heedless souls to ponder upon that which hath come to pass in the past, they would comprehend the station of this blessed Day and attain unto that which is intended. However, the love of the world and its concerns hath so seized them all that no awareness remaineth for any soul save whom God willeth. Blessed are those servants whom neither the knowledge of the learned nor the might of the enemies hath kept back from the divine path nor deprived of the everlasting Kawthar. The Command is in God’s hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He is the Single One, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That which hath appeared unto each of those who have turned unto Him and attained His presence is, in truth, sanctified above all peer and likeness. We beseech God to assist the bearers of His tablets that they may drink of the living waters of His divine utterances. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Mention hath been made of the ascension of Muhammad-Sadiq - upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah] - from the land of Ya. It was presented before the countenance of the Lord of ancient days, and these exalted words shone forth from the Dayspring of His Will. His glory be exalted!</p>
<p>He is the All-Forgiving, the Concealer!</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Sadiq! Blessed art thou for having believed in the Truth on a day when all mankind turned away save those who willed and desired. I bear witness that thou didst turn unto the horizon of the Cause when most of the servants turned away therefrom. O Thou Symbol of the Kingdom and Sovereign of the Realm of Might! I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy revelation in Thy days and the fragrant scents of the garment of Thy knowledge throughout Thy lands, and by the Name through which the sincere hastened unto the Dayspring of destiny, O Lord of all names, and the near ones hastened unto the place of sacrifice, O Creator of the heavens, that Thou forgive him who hath ascended unto Thee and efface his misdeeds through Thy bounty. O Lord! Ordain for him, through Thy grace, that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and pure ones. O Lord! Thou knowest what hath befallen Thy loved ones in Thy days and hearest their sighing and moaning in the prison of Thine enemies. I beseech Thee by them and by those who have sacrificed their spirits in their longing to meet Thee, to assist Thy loved ones in that which Thou lovest and approvest. Then send down at this moment upon him who hath ascended unto Thee and attained Thy presence that whereby his traces shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over both sovereign and subject. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! By the life of your Beloved and mine, this servant is filled with longing, for in these days the spring of divine favour hath encompassed the world, and it is the time of ascension and passing, for man attaineth unto a remembrance that shineth like the sun from the horizon of the heaven of God’s Book - a remembrance which neither extinction shall overtake nor annihilation find. Under all conditions one must be content and thankful, for He knoweth what is best for these servants. He knoweth what we have, and we know not what He hath, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>They had likewise made mention of Mashhadi ’Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. Time and again he hath been remembered in the divine presence. God willing, may he be assisted to serve the Cause, that the manifestation, signs and fruits of the Tree of Being may endure through the perpetuity of God’s names, evident and manifest in all things. A letter from the spiritual friend Aqa Khalil, upon him be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Glorious, addressed to Aqa Muhammad Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, arrived and was presented at the Most Holy Court. They said:</p>
<p>O thou who art present! A sweet fragrance emanateth from them. God willing, may they be assisted in all conditions to remember and praise God with joy and delight. Verily We have heard his call and the mentions contained in his letter, and We have remembered them with My manifest remembrance, and strengthened them through My grace, and We counsel them with that whereby the Cause shall be exalted, and I am the Commanding, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Repeatedly their mention was heard from the blessed tongue. In the letter of Aqa Mirza Mahdi, upon him be the Glory of God, mention was also made of them. Verily our Lord, the Most Merciful, is the Munificent Bestower.</p>
<p>They made mention of the honored Mulla Mustafa, upon him be the Glory of God. This servant beseecheth God that He may assist him to serve the Cause. O beloved of my heart! Steadfastness is a mighty matter. God willing, may they be assisted to act with wisdom and attain unto service. At this moment I was summoned to the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and after presenting myself before the Throne, They said: Write to Nabil-i-Qa’in, upon him be the Glory of God, to convey greetings to the loved ones of God who dwell in those regions and gladden them with God’s favors. The land of M and Y hath been under the glance of God’s favor. Blessed are My loved ones in those parts, and blessed, again blessed, is he who turned to God in the early days. We have remembered him and remembered them through Our grace, and We counsel them to observe wisdom, calmness, dignity, and to refrain from confronting any of the servants. They should drink the Kawthar of immortality in secret, in the name of their Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. We perceive from the land of M and R the fragrance of My love. Soon will God exalt it through justice. We counsel its people to practice righteousness and God-consciousness and whatsoever befitteth the days of God, the Lord of the worlds. We make mention of My loved ones in its surroundings and give them the glad tidings of My acceptance of them and My remembrance of them. And We make mention of S and Y and those around it. Blessed are My loved ones there who have cast aside the vain imaginings of men, holding fast to My straight path. And We bid them observe wisdom lest there be raised the clamor of those who have been heedless of this mighty Cause.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! All are blessed with divine grace and are speaking His praise. Yet they must not be deceived, for deceivers and tricksters have ever sought out sincere and pure souls. As was written from the land of Ra and Shin, a certain person named Rasul, who for years served Jinab-i-’Andalib (upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory) and who imagined himself soaring in the atmosphere of certitude, ultimately broke his covenant of faithfulness and returned to his former state. He then directed his attention to those regions to mislead others and acquire wealth. Therefore, you must be vigilant and alert those around you, for the armies of polytheism appear in the name of truth, and often they change their names. May God protect us and you from the evil of such people. Likewise, emphasize that they should not be quick to believe the words of every speaker, nor trust every soul, although it is possible that due to some ill feelings between them, heedlessness has caused him to turn away from the truth. I beseech God to guide such souls, and since they have dwelt for a time beneath His shadow, may He not now deprive them. Man is prone to error - were it not for His grace and favor, this servant would be more sinful than any sinner. With a hundred thousand tongues I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to grant those souls that which purifies and sanctifies hearts, and to grant this servant that which causes steadfastness and arising to serve. Regarding most of those regions, favor has been shown; God willing, they will attain to it. Finally, convey greetings and salutations from this evanescent servant to each of God’s loved ones and friends. I request that all not forget this evanescent one in their good prayers, that God, exalted be His glory, may assist this dust to perform the service entrusted to him. May the glory that shines resplendent from the horizon of our Lord’s favor be upon you and upon those who have drunk the wine of faith from the hand of their Lord’s bounty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Praise be to God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>He is the Dawning Place from the horizon of the Kingdom of Utterance!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who has subdued the world through His Most Great Name and has sent down in every time from the heaven of grace of His name, the Most Merciful, the feast of wisdom and utterance and the bounty of knowledge and understanding. From His Most Exalted Pen has flowed the river of mercy and exposition, whereby those in the graves have arisen before the faces of all religions. Exalted, exalted is His grace! Exalted, exalted is His generosity! Exalted, exalted is His bounty! And exalted is His Word which, when it issueth forth from the mouth of Will, causeth the ocean of knowledge and wisdom to surge and the fragrance of the garment to waft among all created things. Exalted, exalted is this Day wherein the throne of divine bestowal hath been established in the prison of ’Akka and the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen hath been raised in the kingdom of creation. Blessed, blessed is the eye that hath seen, the ear that hath heard, and the tongue that hath proclaimed and said:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Possessor of the Kingdom of Names, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all who are in earth and heaven! Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by the pearls hidden in the ocean of Thy Most Great Name, and by the mysteries concealed from the eyes of the nations, and by the breathings of Thy revelation and the dawning-places of Thy inspiration, to adorn Thy servants with the ornament of trustworthiness and justice. Thou art the Possessor of bounty and grace. O Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation. Aid them to make good what they have missed in Thy days and to return to the court of Thy holy might and to turn in repentance to the door of Thy bounty. Verily, Thou art the Powerful over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>O Khalil! We have given thee to drink from the cups of wisdom and utterance and from the goblet of knowledge and understanding, time after time. We beseech God to aid thee to be steadfast in His Cause and to enable thee to do what beseemeth His days.</p>
<p>O Jalil! We counsel thee to assist the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds. Victory appeareth through hosts, and the hosts are goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct. We ask God to adorn thee with virtuous character and with God-fearing which We have made the commander of the hosts of deeds and character. We beseech God to assist the oppressed through the standards of justice and the banners of equity. He is the Possessor of gifts and favors. Now We speak with light as a bounty from Us unto thee and unto those who have believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>O ’Ali! The call of God is raised, the ocean of bounty is surging, and the door of grace is opened. Blessed are they who enter in. We beseech God to make thee a knight in the arena of utterance. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Beloved of God! Canst thou forsake all else save Me and arise to serve My Cause, the One that ruleth over all who are in the heavens and the earth? Say: This could not be except through Thy bounty and grace and might and sovereignty. O Lord! Strengthen me with the hosts of wisdom and utterance that I may transform hearts and souls and illumine them with the light of Thy knowledge and the effulgences of the lights of the Daystar of Thy Revelation. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant, and I acknowledge what Thou hast revealed in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures and Thy Tablets. I beseech Thee to take me from myself and make me a bird soaring in the atmosphere of Thy love, enkindled with the fire of Thy Cause, and attracted to Thy verses. Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing.</p>
<p>O Ibrahim, O Wise One! God willing, thou shalt be illumined by the effulgences of the Sun of Truth and enkindled with the fire of love in such wise that thou mayest set the world aflame. We imparted these words to one of the wise ones: “O Sage! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness!” The power and structure of faith have grown weak throughout the regions of the world - the supreme remedy is needed. The black sulfide of the nations hath seized them - the greatest elixir is required. O Sage! Hath the crown of victory such power as to transform diverse elements into a single thing and bring them to the station of pure gold? Though such transformation appeareth difficult and complex, yet the transformation of earthly power into heavenly might is possible before this Wronged One. That which effecteth this transformation is greater than any elixir. This station and this power are specific to the Word of God. It is the essence that transformeth fear into certitude, weakness into strength, and abasement into glory. One drop from the ocean of divine wisdom struck Badi’ and like a globe of fire he arose seeking martyrdom - his moisture was transformed to fire, his weakness to power, his sluggishness to swiftness. God willing, thou shalt drink of the Kawthar of divine utterance from the revealed words and offer it to those who turn to God and are ready to receive it.</p>
<p>O Aqa Bik! Today the fragrances of God’s Word have perfumed the world and the pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared and shone forth from the treasury of the Supreme Pen. Beseech God that He may aid all and deprive none from the splendors of the Sun of Truth. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Beloved! The Best Beloved remembereth thee in prison. We hope that through deeds and character thou mayest attract souls and guide them to the horizon of the manifestation of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.</p>
<p>O Husayn! This Wronged One hath from the beginning until now been afflicted in the hands of enemies. The Shi’ih sect hath been reared in vain imaginings. Ask God to deliver them all and illumine them with the lights of the Daystar of certitude. Verily, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>O Buyuk Aqa, O thou who gazest toward the Supreme Horizon and soarest in the atmosphere of the love of the Lord of the Kingdom of Names! His Honor Ismu’llah and His Honor Jalil, upon them be the Glory of God, the Beautiful, mentioned thee and sent word to the Most Holy Court. We testify that thou didst hear the Call and turn to it, and wert blessed to hearken unto it. We mentioned thee before in such wise as caused the fragrance of utterance to waft throughout creation. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who heard and found. Woe to the heedless! And praise be to God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O Muhammad! At this moment a messenger from the City of Lovers set forth toward the Daystar of the horizons. His tidings were of unity and concord among the people of justice and the Covenant, and his gift was the sanctified, detached spirits who in God’s path attained the most exalted, supreme station and the most glorious martyrdom. Glory be to God! Were the effects and fruits of wisdom and the mysteries of those spirits to appear even less than the eye of a needle, all the parties of the world would seek that station and circle round the gathering-place of the Supreme Concourse. We mention the party of God and bid them to unity and concord. Blessed are they who have turned to the Supreme Horizon and are free and detached from all else but God.</p>
<p>O Isma’il! When thou hast attained unto God’s verses and His signs, and drunk the Kawthar of utterance from the hand of His bounty, say: […]</p>
<p>O my God, my God! I testify that by Thy Name the hearts of the Supreme Paradise were entranced, and by Thy most sweet call all created things were overturned, and by the light of Thy utterance the earth and heaven were illumined, and by Thy being seated upon the throne the call was raised from the direction of Sinai. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names and Creator of the heavens, by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen, to open unto my face and unto the faces of Thy servants the gates of Thy justice and bounty. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful over what Thou willest, and within Thy grasp are the reins of all in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O Pen! Turn toward him who is named Mahmud, then make mention of him with that which causeth all existence to soar. We have revealed that which was hidden from sight and concealed in the treasury of the protection of thy Chosen Lord, as a favor from Us and a mercy from Our presence unto the righteous and the learned. Say:</p>
<p>O God of the world and Desire of the nations! Thou seest me fleeing from myself unto Thee, from my poverty unto the ocean of Thy wealth, and from my powerlessness unto the horizon of Thy might. Send down, then, upon me and upon Thy party from the heaven of Thy bounty the table of Thy knowledge, and ordain for us that whereby hearts and minds may be attracted. There is none other God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
<p>O Tongue of Eternity! The springtime of utterance hath come unto thee. Make clear unto the parties that which will preserve them from the wolves who have cast the fundamentals of God behind their backs, clinging to their vain imaginings and idle fancies. This is a day wherein the breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted over all possibility, and the Herald hath called out from the right of the Throne: O people of the earth! Despair not of God’s mercy and grace, and deprive not yourselves of the ocean of His bounty. Hasten with your hearts unto the direction of God, the Lord of the Day of Resurrection. Verily the Pen calleth out, the Tablet speaketh, and the ink discourseth, yet most of the people hear not. They pass by the verses and recognize them not, they hear from the direction of the Prison and perceive not. Say: Fear God, O people, and follow not those who have denied God’s proof and evidence, who have disbelieved in His favor and disputed His sovereignty which dominateth over all that was and shall be.</p>
<p>O ’Ali-Qabl-i-Sultan! This is a day wherein the Speaker of the Mount speaketh and the Tree calleth out before the faces of the parties: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords! We have created the servants for the triumph of the Cause - to this beareth witness the Mother Book in the final return. Aid ye, O people, your Lord, the All-Merciful, through wisdom and utterance, and through such conduct as will attract the hearts of every doubter and hesitant one. We have announced unto all this Most Great Revelation. Among the people are those who have been so attracted by the wine of utterance that the ranks of the enemies have not prevented them from turning unto God, the Lord of all men. When thou findest the fragrance of My utterance, say:</p>
<p>My God! Leave me not deprived of the breezes of Thy days, nor barred from turning toward the horizon of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name which speaketh before the faces of the nations, and by the Crimson Ark which Thou hast ordained and manifested for the people of Baha, to make me one of those whom Thou hast described in Thy Mighty Book with Thy words “On them shall be no fear, neither shall they grieve.” Verily, we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return.</p>
<p>O Ali-Quli! None can soar in this atmosphere save he who hath cast away vain desire and then all names. Such a one is numbered with the people of Baha in the Book of God, Lord of all worlds. Among men are those whom names have withheld from their Creator, and among them are those who have turned to Him and said: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou through Whom was revealed that which lay hidden in the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.” Fear God, O people, then follow that which ye have been commanded in My perspicuous Book. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Mirza Rida! Hear the call from the Prison of Akka - there is no God but He, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: “My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call, shown me Thy signs, and given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy knowledge from the hand of Thy bounty. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee by Thy most great signs and by Thy Name through which those in earth and heaven were thunderstruck, to make me hold fast to Thy cord and cling to the hem of Thy grace. O Lord! Ordain for me through Thy generosity that which will draw me nigh unto Thee. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.”</p>
<p>O Muhammad! In these days one of the lovers sacrificed his soul for the Day Star of the horizons, and the fire of longing and desire became ignited in that blessed city. The Ridvan of the Most Exalted Paradise hath given glad tidings to the Ridvan of the Supreme Paradise, announcing that at this moment the Bird of Immortality, after circling round the Gathering-Place of the Supreme Concourse, will wing its flight to this station. Inform the Maidens of the Mansions that they may prepare themselves for this presence. Thus hath spoken the One Who conversed on Sinai in this exalted and glorious station. Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath sent down unto thee that which no treasures can equal.</p>
<p>O Ustad Abdullah! In the great city, one of the loved ones set out to circle round the Supreme Horizon and the Most Exalted Summit. He left behind the temple of flesh and, with spirit and delight, proceeded to circumambulate. By My life! He hath attained unto that which none before him attained. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this from the Most Exalted Station. Grieve thou not over anything. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having remembered thee in the prison and revealed unto thee that which caused the hearts of those near unto Him to be attracted.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Hasan! The calumniators in the great city have committed that which no oppressor hath ever committed. A grievous blow hath been dealt to trustworthiness, and a mighty stroke hath fallen upon the face of truthfulness. Beseech thou God that He may bestow justice upon the people of tyranny and grant equity unto the people of oppression. Glory be to God! They denied the favor and disbelieved in the signs of God. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to either seize them with His justice or enable them to return unto Him. Verily, He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>O Baqir Khan! The temple of justice lieth captive under the talons of tyranny, helpless trustworthiness suffereth beneath the claws of malice, and hapless truthfulness hath taken refuge in the corner of bewilderment due to the persecution of the oppressors. Soon shall every oppressor receive his due recompense. Divine justice lieth in wait. He shall seize the oppressors with His might and authority from His presence. Verily, He is the most powerful of the powerful ones and the most generous of the generous ones. Say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having remembered me. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance to assist me in serving Thy Cause. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>And We make mention of the son in this station. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to send down upon him from the heaven of His bounty mercy from His presence and loving-kindness from His side. Verily, He is the All-Generous, the Compassionate, the All-Forgiving.</p>
<p>O Hassan! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Knower of the hidden and the manifest! The wolves of the earth have surrounded the divine sheep from every direction. They have hamstrung the divine She-Camel and have stretched forth the hand of transgression against the Crimson Ark. And finding this Wronged One without helper or assistant, they have from every quarter set their designs against Him. Glory be to God! Such enmity hath appeared as hath no equal or likeness. And seeing the people of God without succor, they have endeavored through fabricated calumnies to extinguish the true Light. It is evident that the government hath assisted and continueth to assist in what hath transpired. Yet this Wronged One regardeth all else save God as non-existent. I swear by the Sun of Utterance that shineth from the horizon of the Prison: were the journalists to become aware of the purpose of the Wronged One, all would turn towards Him and speak the truth. But the rancor and hatred of the former party will not be stilled or quieted save through the power of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist thee and grant thee success in that which He loveth and is pleased with.</p>
<p>O Royal Falcon! We hope that thou wilt spread thy spiritual wings and teach the hesitant ones to soar. In these days the hands of oppression have been raised from every direction. The patriots of the world attribute reform to corruption. Glory be to God! They praise themselves for patriotism, yet this party worshipeth God, not the homeland. Would that they were truthful even in this claim! By the life of God, they worship their own selves and their passions. They claim impartiality, yet their deeds and what proceedeth from them give them the lie. From before, this hidden pearl hath been revealed from the Divine Pen’s treasury: “Let not your deeds become partners to your hopes.” Woe to the condition of one wronged against whom the princes and ministers of Iran speak and rise up in opposition! It is then obvious what a journalist would write and say. Assuredly there must arise one who will stand before the Divine Seat of Justice and seek justice and equity for the oppressed party, and implore victory and triumph. By My life! The manifestations of justice exist among the people, yet are hidden from the eyes of the heedless. God shall soon exalt His Cause despite every remote oppressor and obdurate heedless one. In any case, ignorance and foolishness have deprived most from the ocean of inner meanings. Say:</p>
<p>My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the Light that shone forth and gleamed from the horizon of the Mount by Thy leave, to assist the calumniators to pure truthfulness, the ones who have turned away to acceptance, and the heedless ones to return unto Thee and to repentance at the gate of Thy mercy. Verily Thou art the One with power over whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all affairs.</p>
<p>O Mulla Haji! At this moment We speak in the clear Persian tongue that perchance all may become aware and attain unto their purpose. This Wronged One appeared in days when naught remained of justice save a name and of equity save a trace. We summoned all to praiseworthy character and goodly deeds. Every fair-minded one beareth witness that this Wronged One hath had and hath no purpose except the reformation of the world and the edification of the souls of nations. We have forbidden the destruction of books, have removed from the Book the decree of holy war and strife, and likewise the decree concerning uncleanliness and the like. Whatsoever conduceth to the elevation of the stations of men, that have We recorded and preserved; and whatsoever leadeth to waywardness, obscurity and the affliction of God’s servants, that have We forbidden. However, as the veils of hatred and animosity have prevented the ear and eye from witnessing and hearing, therefore hath every soul attributed to the Truth, exalted be His glory, that which he hath seen in his own mirror. Soon shall they see the recompense of their deeds on earth without clear proof or Book.</p>
<p>O Hasan! The excellence of the world hath been transformed into baseness, inasmuch as the reins of affairs are seen to be in the grasp of the ignorant. Beseech thou God that He may raise up and appoint over His servants a just commander and an equitable ruler. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest how the oppressors have surrounded the dawning-places of Thy justice and the daysprings of Thy bounty, and how the calumniators have encompassed the manifestations of Thy truthfulness and the daysprings of Thy generosity. I beseech Thee, O King of Kings and Compassionate Lord of all who are possessed of kings, by the Word whereby Thou didst open the doors of the hearts of those of Thy servants who were nigh unto Thee, and the hearts of the sincere ones among Thy creation, to illumine the hearts of the heedless with the light of turning unto Thee. Then aid them to turn towards the ocean of Thy mercy and the sun of Thy generosity. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Kind.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Hasan before Ali, that the fragrances of remembrance may seize him and draw him nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. In these days, from every direction a dart flieth and a sword is visible, and this Wronged One hath clung to the cord of patience and gazeth toward the horizon of resignation. When the divines of Iran and the mystics and princes thereof reject a station and conceal its virtues, then it becometh evident what hath befallen it and what shall befall it. However, as it hath occurred in the path of God, there hath been and is no harm. By His very Self, the Truth! We would not exchange one atom of tribulation in His path for the station of the seen and the unseen. We beseech God that He deprive not His servants of the splendors of the Sun of justice and equity, and We ask Him, exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which shall exalt thee through His name amongst His servants. Verily He is the Omnipotent, the All-Choosing.</p>
<p>O Ali! We counsel thee and those who have believed in that which will draw you nigh unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This is the Day of God and His Cause is His Cause. Blessed is the soul that hath detached itself from all else save Him and hath turned unto Him in all days and nights. The Pen of the Lord of all beings hath occupied itself with the mention of His loved ones, and hath repeatedly made mention of each one and commanded that which leadeth to the elevation and exaltation of their station. He is the Helper and Succourer. Beseech God that He may graciously aid all to remember Him, to praise Him and to serve His Cause. He is the Mighty One Whom the hosts of the world cannot hinder and the ranks of the nations cannot weaken.</p>
<p>O Ali! Take fast hold of the sure handle and cleave to the most holy and luminous hem. This Day is known as the Day of God and is recorded in the Book. Yet the immature ones of the world have drawn the sword of rejection against the Wronged One of the horizons and are occupied day and night with schemes and deception. We beseech God not to deprive the oppressive souls of the sweetness of the Kawthar of justice. He is the Sovereign Whom the world’s rejection or acceptance neither diminisheth nor increaseth. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth and the Protector of all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>O Mashhadi Rida! The Lord of the kingdoms of names hath this night turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee. Rejoice thou in this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, Who hath appeared with the Most Great Name. I beseech Thee by the pearls hidden in the ocean of Thy knowledge and by the fruits treasured in the repository of Thy wisdom to aid me to be steadfast in Thy love. O my Lord! Who is able to arise to serve Thy Cause? Nay, by Thy glory! None can do this save through Thy power and strength. I beseech of Thee that which is the cause of the greatest steadfastness. O Generous One! Withhold not Thy servant from the ocean of knowledge and deprive him not of the sun of vision. Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty. There is none other God but Thee, the Lord of all beings and the Master of the throne on high and of the dust below.</p>
<p>O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Ahmad-i-Aqa that he may give thanks unto his Lord and be numbered among those who are assured in the Mother Book, inscribed by the Pen of God. Grieve not over anything. Trust in God in all matters. Verily He protecteth His loved ones through hosts that are hidden from sight. This is a Day wherein the Most Great Ocean hath surged and the fragrance of Paradise hath wafted. Blessed is he who hath found it, and woe unto him who remained heedless and was far removed from the precincts of nearness. Rejoice thou in My mention of thee. All the treasures of kings cannot equal it. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this in this station that transcendeth understanding. When thou hast quaffed the choice wine of My utterance and drunk from the Kawthar of My bounty, say:</p>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having guided me unto Thy horizon, caused me to hear Thy call, and revealed unto me that which lay hidden in Thy Book. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the effulgences of the Orb of Thy grace to aid me to act according to what Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book and to enable me to serve Thy loved ones. Thou art the Omnipotent Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate, nor can the ascendancy of those who have been deprived of the breezes of revelation.</p>
<p>O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Javad! God willing, mayest thou be illumined by the light of His Cause and enkindled with the fire of divine love. Know ye the value of these days and act as befitteth them. Blessed is the soul that hath taken its stand beneath the banner of righteousness - such a one is reckoned among those nigh unto God in His Book. The friends must all engage in service to the Cause. Among the greatest services, mentioned with God and crowned with His acceptance, hath been and ever shall be the reconciliation of hearts. Blessed is he who hath achieved that which he was bidden by the Ancient Ordainer.</p>
<p>O Husayn! Hearken unto the call from the precincts of ’Akka. Verily it kindleth thee with the fire of love, draweth thee nigh unto the Dayspring of the light of oneness, guardeth thee from the cawing of the croakers, and preserveth thee from the hosts of the oppressors who have broken God’s covenant and His testament, who have denied His proof and His evidence, and who have committed that which hath caused the near ones to lament.</p>
<p>O Khalil! The Glorious Lord is afflicted and tormented in the hands of the Nimrods of the world. At every moment some harm befalleth Him, and each day some calamity descendeth. The fire of hatred blazeth from every direction. Glory be to God! Such malice hath appeared as hath had and hath no likeness or equal. That unjust one, seeing the Wronged One without any helper, hath perpetrated that which no cruel one or oppressor hath ever wrought. Verily, We fear not him nor those whom he hath led astray to commit an oppression the like of which the eye of creation hath not beheld. We beseech God to aid all to return unto Him. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O ’Abdu’l-Jalil! We have turned toward thee from the precincts of the Prison and have mentioned thee in such wise as to perpetuate thy remembrance throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this most great favor and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, for having mentioned me and numbered me among those who have attained unto the hearing of Thy call and the beholding of Thy signs. I testify that through Thy Most Exalted Word the spirit of life was breathed into all creation, and through Thee was made manifest that which had been hidden from eyes and sight.</p>
<p>O Islam! The divine sheep are afflicted amongst wolves. Each day there occurreth that which causeth the greatest consternation. The owls of the world have purposed its destruction. Beseech thou God that He deprive not His servants of justice and fairness. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His firm and mighty command.</p>
<p>O ’Abbas! There hath befallen Us that which hath befallen no one else among all created things. The newspaper Akhtar hath raised its banner out of hatred for this Wronged One. Its purpose hath been and still is to curry favor with the oppressors. We beseech God to decree for them what He willeth and to raise Me unto Him. Verily He is the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Mahdi! We have heard the cry of My loved ones and have answered them from this glorious and exalted Station. This is a precious and blessed day. All must arise to do what is meet and seemly, and guide heedless souls to the horizon of awareness. We beseech God to assist all to stand firm in this Great Steadfastness and to rend asunder the veils that have come between Him and His creatures. Verily He is the Lord of Names and the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Praise be to God! The souls mentioned have attained unto God’s infinite favors. We beseech Him to keep all steadfast. Verily He hath power over all things.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, mention is made of Khan Baba Khan, whom We have mentioned before and for whom We have revealed that which has diffused the fragrance of God’s loving-kindness throughout all else. We beseech God at this hour to protect him, to aid him, to exalt him through His Name amongst His servants, and to assist him in the service of His mighty Cause. There is none other God but He, the Single, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Remember those days when thou wert present before the Countenance and didst hear the Call and behold the Supreme Horizon. He verily strengthened thee, prospered thee, and revealed unto thee that which shall not perish so long as God’s Kingdom, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, shall endure. We counsel thee and those who have believed to manifest praiseworthy character and goodly deeds. Verily thy Lord’s knowledge encompasses all things; He witnesseth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He walketh with the heaven of grace at His right hand and the kingdom of bounty at His left, while before His shining and luminous face waveth the banner of detachment. Rejoice in that thou hast attained unto the Kawthar of God’s utterance, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Ismi Jamal hath made mention of thee in his petitions and hath desired for thee grace from this blessed, mighty and resplendent Dayspring. Therefore have We turned unto thee from this direction and revealed unto thee that whereby hearts are drawn and the minds of them that know are attracted.</p>
<p>O Khalil! Thy mention hath also come from Samandar, who hath soared in the atmosphere of My love and risen to serve My Cause. We make mention of thee and reveal unto thee this mighty Tablet. There hath befallen him at the hands of the enemies that which hath caused those near unto God to lament and the sincere ones to cry out “Verily we are God’s, and verily unto Him shall we return.”</p>
<p>His honor Samandar and Ism-i-Jud have repeatedly made mention of you. If there hath been delay in sending Tablets, it hath been and is due to the multitude of writing. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to protect thee and His loved ones, and to forgive those for whom thou hast sought forgiveness from the ocean of His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous; He is the Munificent, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>=== END BH00143 ===</p>
<p>=== START BH00144 ===</p>
<p>He is the Most High, the Most Exalted in the Heaven of Abha!</p>
<p>Make mention of the name of thy Lord’s servant when he entered the Spot of Paradise, the place whereon shone forth the lights of the Countenance from the Dawning-Place of Beauty with perspicuous signs, and stood before the Throne, the scene of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and heard the melodies of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, and attained unto all good when the breezes of holiness wafted upon him from the Ridvan of God, the Most High, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Ancient Beauty! Give glad tidings unto him who stood before the Throne concerning that which was ordained for him in the preserved holy scrolls. Say: Verily thy arrival upon the shore of grandeur, the station wherein surged the ocean of names through the name of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, is better than all that hath been created in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>O thou who journeyest unto God! Take thy portion from this ocean and deprive not thyself of that which hath been ordained therein, and be of them that attain. Were all who are in the heavens and earth to be given but a drop thereof, they would find themselves enriched through the enrichment of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Take, with the hand of detachment, a handful from this Living Ocean, then sprinkle it upon all created things, that they may be purified from human limitations and be brought nigh unto the Most Sublime Vision of God, this hallowed and resplendent spot.</p>
<p>If thou findest thyself alone, grieve not, for God sufficeth thee. Commune then with Him and be of the thankful. Deliver the Cause of thy Lord to all who are in the heavens and on earth. If thou findest one who turneth unto it, reveal unto him the pearls of the wisdom of God, thy Lord, which the Spirit hath cast upon thee, and be of them that turn. And if thou findest one who turneth away, turn thou away from him and put thy trust in God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>By the True One! Whosoever openeth his lips today in remembrance of the name of his Lord, upon him shall descend the hosts of divine inspiration from the dawning-place of My name, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, and the denizens of the Supreme Concourse shall descend upon him with chalices of light. Thus hath it been ordained in the heaven of command by One mighty and powerful.</p>
<p>God hath, behind the Tabernacle of Holiness, servants who shall appear on earth and aid this Cause, and they shall fear no one even should all creation war against them. These shall arise between the heavens and earth, making mention of God with their loudest voice and calling the people unto the path of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Follow thou in their footsteps, fear no one, and be of them whom the clamor of the people doth not sadden in the path of their Creator, nor are deterred by the blame of the blamer.</p>
<p>Go forth with the Tablet of God and His signs unto them that have believed, and give them glad tidings of the holy Ridvan. Then warn the idolaters. Say: O people! By God, I have come to you from the direction of the Throne with a message from God, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great, and in my hand is a proof from God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. Weigh it with the true balance of whatsoever proofs ye possess from the Prophets and Messengers. If ye find it to be the truth from God, beware lest ye dispute concerning it or render your deeds vain, and be not of the idolaters.</p>
<p>These are the verses of God which have been sent down in truth, and through them His Cause hath been established among His creation, and the banners of sanctity have been raised between the heavens and earth. Say: O people! This is the sealed and guarded Scroll which was inscribed by the Finger of Holiness and concealed behind the veils of the Unseen, and hath now been sent down through grace from One mighty and ancient. Therein have We ordained the destinies of all who dwell in the heavens and on earth, and the knowledge of the ancients.</p>
<p>Say: His knowledge comprehendeth both the first and the last, and nothing escapeth His knowledge, nor is there aught He is powerless to accomplish among all created things, if ye be of them that understand. Say: The return hath come again, and We have stretched forth the hand of power over all who are in the heavens and on earth, and have manifested from Our Most Great Mystery, based on pure truth, secrets beyond reckoning. Thereupon did the Sinaites expire at the dawning of this crimson Light upon the Spot of Sinai. Thus did the Beauty of the All-Merciful come upon the clouds of proof, and the decree was fulfilled by God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Say to the Maiden of Paradise: Come forth from the chambers of holiness, then array thyself in the silk of eternity as thou pleaseth, and in the shimmering green silk in My Most Glorious Name. Then hearken to the most wondrous and sweet melodies raised from the direction of thy Lord’s Most Exalted Throne. Then appear from the horizon of the veil with the ornament of the heavenly maiden, and deprive not the servants of the radiance of thy shining countenance. And shouldst thou hear the sighing of the peoples of earth and heaven, grieve not - leave them to perish in the dust of extinction and be annihilated by the fire of hatred kindled in their souls. Then sing with the sweetest melodies between earth and heaven in remembrance of the Name of the King of Names and Attributes. Thus have We ordained the matter for thee, and verily We are powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Beware lest thou remove from thy most pure form the most luminous garment. Rather, add unto it at all times from the garments of eternity in the heaven of creation, that the ornament of God may be manifest through thee in all things besides Him, and thy Lord’s grace be perfected unto all worlds. And shouldst thou find in anyone the fragrance of thy Lord’s love, sacrifice thyself in His path, for We created thee for Him, and thus did We take from thee the covenant in the eternal atoms before the company of them that are nigh. Be not dismayed by the arrows of conjecture from the people of allusions - leave them to themselves, for they follow the promptings of Satan.</p>
<p>Then cry out between earth and heaven: “By God the Truth! I am the Maiden created by Glory in the palace of His Most Glorious Name, and He adorned my soul with the ornament of Names in the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily, I was preserved behind the veils of chastity and concealed from the gaze of creation, when I heard the most wondrous melodies from the right side of the All-Merciful. I bear witness that the Paradise stirred within itself with longing to hear it and desire to attain its presence.” Thus have We sent down in the Qayyumu’l-Asma’ upon the melody of eternity, and upon the sweetest melody in this clear Tablet.</p>
<p>Say: He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth; by His sovereignty He ordaineth what He desireth by His command, and He shall not be asked of what He willeth and desireth. He is the Chosen One, the Powerful, the Wise. They that have denied God and His sovereignty, these are they whom the self and passion have overcome, and they shall return to their abode in the fire - evil indeed is the abode of the deniers.</p>
<p>Adorn thyself with My love, then thy heart with My remembrance, then thy tongue with the propagation of My Cause. Thus hath it been ordained for thee in preserved tablets of might. Then walk among the people with God’s dignity and tranquility, that His signs may be manifest through thee among the worlds. If there be kindled within thy soul from this Fire which God hath lit in the heart of Paradise, that the warmth of the Cause might be generated through thee in the hearts of them that have believed in God and are of the faithful. Walk thou in My footsteps and speak naught but pure truth, then show humility before God’s unified servants. Thus doth the Tongue of the Cause counsel thee - hearken unto what thou art commanded, then act upon it, that thou mayest be of them that attain. Verily, they from whom God’s signs are not manifest in His commandments - the verdict of faith shall not be confirmed for them. Yet most people remain veiled from God’s Cause.</p>
<p>Speak not except in absolute truth, then be submissive to the servants of God who are believers in His unity. Thus doth the Tongue of Divine Command admonish thee. Hearken unto that which thou art bidden, then act accordingly, that thou mayest be among those who have attained. Verily, those from whom the signs of God are not manifested in His commandments - upon them shall not be confirmed the decree of faith, yet most people remain veiled from God’s Cause and are among the most lost of evil folk.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Doth it befit anyone to attribute himself to his Lord, the Most Merciful, while committing that which Satan himself would commit? Nay, by the Beauty of the All-Glorious, were ye of them that know! Sanctify your hearts from love of the world, then your tongues from mention of aught save Him, then your limbs from whatsoever would keep you from attaining His presence and draw you nigh unto the promptings of desire. Fear God, O people, and be of the God-fearing.</p>
<p>Say: O people! If ye say what ye do not practice, what then is the difference between you and those who said “God is our Lord,” yet when He came to them upon the clouds of holiness, they denied Him and were among the rejectors? Free yourselves from the world and its ornaments. Beware lest ye draw nigh unto it, for it biddeth you to transgression and wickedness and preventeth you from the straight path of glory. Know ye that the world is your heedlessness of your Creator and your occupation with aught else save Him. The hereafter is that which draweth you nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Whatsoever preventeth you this day from the love of God - that indeed is the world. Shun it, that ye may be among the successful ones.</p>
<p>He whom nothing preventeth from God - no harm shall come to him though he adorn himself with the ornaments of the earth and its decorations and whatsoever hath been created therein, for God hath created all that is in the heavens and on earth for His servants who believe in His unity. Eat, O people, of that which God hath made lawful unto you and deprive not yourselves of His wondrous bounties. Then give thanks unto Him and be of the thankful.</p>
<p>O thou who hast migrated unto God! Deliver unto the people the messages of thy Lord, that perchance they may be withheld from the direction of self and passion, and may remember the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great. Say: O people! Fear God, shed not blood, oppose no soul, and be of the doers of good. Beware lest ye spread corruption in the land after its reformation, and follow not the ways of the heedless. Whosoever among you desireth to deliver the Cause of his Lord, it behooveth him first to deliver it unto himself, then unto the people, that his words may attract the hearts of the hearers. Without this, his words will never influence the hearts of the seekers. Beware, O people, lest ye be of them who enjoin righteousness upon others but forget their own selves. Such are belied by whatsoever proceedeth from their mouths, then by the realities of things, then by the angels drawn nigh. And if the words of these have influence upon anyone, this is not from them but from what hath been ordained in the words by the presence of One mighty and wise. Their likeness in the sight of God is as a lamp from which servants receive light while it consumeth itself and becometh of those that are consumed.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Commit not that whereby your honor and the honor of the Cause are lost among the servants, lest ye be numbered among the workers of corruption. Draw not nigh unto that which your minds reject. Shun iniquity, for it hath been forbidden unto you in the Book which none may touch save those whom God hath cleansed from every impurity and made them of the purified ones. Be just with yourselves, then with others, that the signs of justice may be manifested from your deeds among Our sincere servants.</p>
<p>Take heed lest ye betray the trust of any person. Be ye trustees among men, and withhold not from the poor what God in His bounty hath bestowed upon you. He verily shall recompense the charitable double what they have expended. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command. He giveth to whomsoever He willeth, and withholdeth from whomsoever He pleaseth. He, verily, is the Giver, the Bountiful, the Mighty, the Gracious.</p>
<p>Say: O people of Baha! Teach ye the Cause of God, for God hath prescribed unto every soul the duty to proclaim His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds, inasmuch as it can never be accepted except after recognition of God, the Mighty, the Powerful. He hath ordained that teaching be accomplished through utterance and not otherwise. Thus hath the command been sent down from the Realm of God, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise. Beware lest ye contend with anyone; rather, explain through goodly speech and wise counsel. If one be receptive, well and good; if not, leave him to himself and turn toward the Holy Court, the sanctified and luminous Seat. Dispute not with anyone concerning the world and what hath been ordained therein, for God hath abandoned it to such as have set their hearts upon it. He desireth naught of it save the hearts of His servants, which are conquered through the hosts of revelation and utterance. Thus hath the decree been recorded by the Fingers of Baha on the Tablet of destiny by the command of One Who is the All-Knowing Ordainer. Have mercy on yourselves, then on your kindred, and then on God’s sincere servants. Should ye find one who is abased, be not proud toward him, for the King of Glory passeth by him in these days, and none knoweth this save him whose will is the Will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>O ye that are rich! When ye behold one who is poor and dust-stained, flee not from him, but rather sit with him and ask concerning that which hath befallen him from the seas of God’s decree. By God, in that state the denizens of the Supreme Concourse will observe you, and will pray for you, and will implore forgiveness for you, and will extol and glorify you with sanctified, pure and eloquent tongues. Blessed is the learned one who prideth not himself on his knowledge, and well is it with the righteous one who revileth not the sinful, concealing their misdeeds that God may conceal his own guilty actions, for He is the best of those who hide faults. Be ye, O people, concealers of faults in the earth and forgivers in the lands, that God may forgive you through His grace. Then pardon ye, that God may pardon you and clothe you in the garment of grace. And should any one of the believers seek your protection and ye have the means, then grant him protection, and deny him not what he seeketh, that God may protect you in the shadow of His mercy on the Day when hearts shall boil, livers shall burn, and the limbs of all creation shall tremble.</p>
<p>Say: O people! Hold fast to pure truthfulness, for by it your souls shall be adorned, your names exalted, your stations elevated, and your ranks enhanced among the people of the earth, and in the life to come ye shall have a mighty reward. Thus do We counsel those who have believed, that they may hear what they are counseled in the Book of God and find their way to Him Who is the Lord of Grace.</p>
<p>O thou who hast attained unto the Most Sublime Vision! The time appointed for thy presence before the Throne hath been fulfilled. Arise, by God’s leave, and take the Book of Divine Grace, then proceed with it unto the lands and give glad tidings unto their people of the good-pleasure of God, the King, the Most High, the Most Great. Yet carry from this Paradise the sweet-scented breezes of fellowship, that thou mayest quicken thereby the hearts of those who have been thunderstruck by the thunderbolt of His Cause, that they may arise from the graves of heedlessness and utter that which the Spirit uttered on that day in the Most Exalted Paradise: that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath come in the name of ’Ali before Nabil is the Manifestation of His sovereignty, the Dayspring of His signs, and the Source of His grace and power unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Moreover, he who speaketh at this hour speaketh by virtue of His might and honor, His grandeur, and furthermore His majesty and glory, unto all created things. Thus doth it behove thee and those who are established in the Seat of His Cause and have quaffed the choice wine that hath been unsealed from this hallowed and luminous Cup.</p>
<p>And when thou arrivest in the Land of Ta, spread this Tablet before Our Name, the All-Bountiful, that his eyes may be solaced thereby and his soul rejoice, and that he may be numbered among those who are glad. Then spread it before those who have emerged from the darkness of idle fancy and taken their station upon the seat of certitude. There thou shalt hear the clamor of those who have disbelieved and turned away and were among the idolaters. Say: O people! Do ye disbelieve in God Who created you and fashioned you and caused you to know the Manifestation of His Self and made you to be among those who know? Beware, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of the oceans of inner meanings and follow every froward devil. Look with sanctified vision upon God’s Balance that ye may recognize His true and upright Balance. Say: Today it behooveth every soul to purify his heart from attachment to whatsoever hath been created between the heavens and the earth, to sanctify his ears from all that he hath heard, and to return his sight unto that which lieth before him of the proofs whereby God hath revealed His Cause in every age and dispensation, and then unto the proof that hath appeared in this day with manifest sovereignty; and to ponder the signs of God and reflect upon them. By God! Then will the sun of certitude dawn upon him from the dayspring of his Lord’s utterance and illumine his heart, and he shall be numbered among those who are assured.</p>
<p>Say: The handiwork of God can never be mistaken for the handiwork of any among the people, yet the people confound themselves. What aileth them that they fail to comprehend even a single utterance from God, the Mighty, the All-Informed? Say: After the rising of the sun and its radiance, doth any light of any luminous thing remain? Nay, by the Self of God, the All-Possessing, the Mighty, the Powerful! Thus have We mentioned the Cause and completed the proof unto all who are on earth, all of them together. And We take God and His chosen ones and furthermore His angels as witnesses that I have not fallen short in aught that I was commanded, and have conveyed His messages unto the East of the earth and its West. He and they suffice as witness and knower concerning Me.</p>
<p>And when thou dost arrive in the Land of Za, remind those servants who dwell there of this Most Great Remembrance. Say: O people! Believe in God and in that which hath been sent down from His presence, and follow not those who have disbelieved in the signs of the All-Merciful and His sovereignty, yet make mention of Him morning and evening. Say: Your likeness is as the likeness of those who would make mention of God at eventide and at dawn, yet when God came unto them in the shadow of His Most Exalted Name, they denied Him and were numbered with the idolaters. Say: O people! Aid ye God with your souls and your possessions, then stand firm in His Cause in such wise that should all who are on earth wage war against you, your feet would not slip from the path of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Stand firm, O people, in that hour when Satan entereth upon you with that which hindereth men from the love of God and calleth them unto the most great tyrant. Thus do We inform you that ye may be of them that know. By the True One! Whatsoever ye have heard concerning this Cause hath appeared from Mine Own invincible and wondrous Command. We have referred it to others for a wisdom from Our presence, lest the hearts of the idolaters be drawn to a single place, and that the Cause might be preserved from the harm of every harmful and obstinate soul. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! They who would conceal their faces from every seeing one have risen against Me with a tyranny wherewith no tyranny of them of old can compare. And when thou seest Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali, give him glad tidings from Our presence, then remind him of that which hath been sent down unto him in tablets of mighty preservation. Say: O servant! Stand firm in the Cause and associate not partners with God, then suffice thyself with Him above all else, and be thou firmly established. Detach thyself from all else but Me, find solace in My remembrance, and be not of the doubtful ones. Arise in pure servitude, for through it the Cause of God, thy Lord, is established and mercy descendeth upon the worlds. Say: O people! Measure not the Cause of God by that which your souls have fancied, transgress not your bounds, and be not of the mischief-makers. And whoso transgresseth his bounds this day shall not be mentioned before God and shall be numbered with the transgressors. Prostrate yourselves before God, your Lord, and when the sun of wisdom shineth forth from the dawning-place of utterance, fall ye down upon the dust in humility before your Lord, the All-Merciful. Thus doth it beseem you, O concourse of them that are near! And whoso hath found the sweetness and delight of servitude will never exchange it for aught of what hath been created between the heavens and the earths. Through it shall your faces be illumined, your breasts purified, your souls sanctified, and your traces exalted among the worlds. Know ye, moreover, that the most honored before God are the most humble and God-fearing among you. Thus have We sent down aforetime and now, and We, verily, are the Senders Down. Hearken, O people, unto that which God commandeth you in the kingdom of His Cause, and be not of them who have been remiss in the side of God and have transgressed that which We have ordained for them. Evil, indeed, is the abode of the transgressors.</p>
<p>O thou who art present before the Throne! Consort with the people with wisdom, then guard thyself lest harm befall thee and it return to the Divine Lote-Tree, exalted and inaccessible. Shun matters that give rise to sedition, then seek thy Lord’s grace at all times. Beware lest thou forget these days. By God! A moment thereof cannot be equaled by the time of those who have gone before or shall come after, and none shall attain unto their presence save whom thy Lord willeth. Thus have We ordained the matter, and We were the Ordainers. Forget not the times when thou wert present before the Throne in the Most Great Paradise, when the Sun of thy Lord’s Beauty shone upon thee at all times with wondrous rays, and thou didst drink the wine of verses from the Kawthar of the All-Merciful, and wert blessed with God’s bounty - the Bestower, the Giver, the Generous. When thou seest one approaching the sanctuary of God to enter the seat of the mighty Throne, prevent him on Our behalf, for thereby souls are troubled and harm returneth to My Self, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Turn not unto the direction of God except by His leave. Thus hath the decree shone forth from the horizon of a wise command. Then convey thy Lord’s command in every city. If thou findest one detached, give him glad tidings of God’s mercy and bounty. Then mention to him what hath befallen Us at the hands of the hosts of Satan. Say: By God! There hath befallen Us what hath befallen no one amongst all creation, whereby the lamentation of every discerning mystic was raised, and all things created in the realm of being weep at My tribulation - nay, all within God’s knowledge, were ye of those who know. Those who were created by the will of My Pen have denied My Self and have written tablets against Me whereby their deeds are rendered vain, though they perceive it not. Thereby have the traces of grace been effaced, the waters of mercy cut off, the clouds of bounty withheld, and the breezes of holiness ceased to blow upon all the worlds. Recount thou the Youth’s tale as thou knowest it - add not nor subtract therefrom, and be upon a straight path of truth. Then inform the people of the calumnies of those souls who have disbelieved and associated partners with God. Say: By God! They desired naught thereby save to turn the servants away from the direction of the Throne. By God! They are in manifest error. When thou arrivest in the land of Ba from Kha, remember on Our behalf its people - both men and women among the devoted ones - that they may rejoice within themselves and be among the glad ones. Say: By God! The Most Great Mystery hath appeared in the eternal form and when He moved His lips with a word, the forms of those near unto God dispersed from around Him. O people! Be steadfast in God’s Cause and His sovereignty and deny not Him in Whom ye believed before. Thus doth the servant counsel you at a time when tribulations have encompassed him from all sides from the manifestations of the polytheists, and he sitteth imprisoned, finding no helper for himself save God, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Wise. By God, the Truth! At every moment I am slain by all swords, and none knoweth this save God, the Counter, the All-Knowing. O thou traveler! We have previously revealed for the devoted women a tablet We named the Tablet of Baha, wherein We made mention through allusion of what hath befallen Us. Take thou a copy thereof, then go unto them and read it unto them that they may remember what hath befallen the Youth from the hosts of Satan. Say: O loved ones of God! Guard yourselves lest Satan prevent you from the remembrance of the All-Merciful. Then remember Him with the melodies of those who are attracted, for by His remembrance hearts are purified, souls are refined, and the hearts of the lovers are drawn nigh.</p>
<p>When thou reachest Kha, make mention there of the sincere servants of God, and convey unto them from Us a remembrance, a mercy and a light. Then recount unto them the story of the Youth, that they may be numbered among those who remember. Then make mention of the name of God, ?, who was of the remnants of the family of Husayn between the heavens and the earth - they who sacrificed their souls in the path of God, their Creator, and were among the striving ones. These are they who strove with their wealth and their souls before the Countenance, until they entered the Paradise of the All-Merciful and were therein among the secure ones. Then they shall rejoice in the Most Exalted Paradise, and the youth of the All-Glorious shall circle round them with chalices of immortality, and the maids of glory shall serve them morning and evening. Thus doth God recompense those who suffered martyrdom in His path, and fulfill the rewards of those who were afflicted with hardships in His Cause. How excellent is the reward of those who strive!</p>
<p>Then turn towards the direction of Our Most Great Name with the Tablet of God and its traces, then enter upon him with a mighty glad-tiding. Then remind him of that which the Spirit hath cast upon thee from this noble scene. Then inform him of the tales of the Youth that he may be apprised of what hath befallen Us in this remote prison, that he may be a partner in Our tribulations and may remember what hath come upon Us in these days, and be of those who remember. Say: O thou who gazeth upon the Most Great Scene! Forget not the remembrance of thy Lord. Arise to the Cause with steadfastness from Us and power from Our presence, and convey unto the people that which thou art commanded, and be not of the patient ones. Seek help at all times from God, thy Lord. Then rend asunder the veils of the deluded ones. Thus did We command thee before, and We command thee now with clear signs.</p>
<p>Then make mention of those who are there from among the detached servants of God. Say: O people! Arise for the Cause of God and His religion, then aid it and be of the helpers. Then know ye that He is indeed independent of all else, and that which He commandeth the people is of His grace unto them, for thereby shall they ascend unto the station of nearness in the Most Exalted Paradise - to this every person of keen insight beareth witness. Thus have We commanded thee and ordained for thee - act according to what thou art commanded and be manifestly just. God shall soon recompense the deeds of those who conveyed His Cause, whom neither the censure of the censurer, nor the gloating of the gloater, nor the prevention of the preventer, nor the abundance of the corrupters deterred.</p>
<p>And when thou beholdest thy brother who hath been named Ahmad in the Kingdom of Names, remind him of the remembrance of God, his Lord. Then mention unto him what hath befallen Us in this far-off land. Say: O servant! Take heed lest thou be grieved in thyself at a time when the souls of all beings, whether small or great, are grief-stricken. Purify thy sight from the veils that thou mayest witness what hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord’s words - the Sun of meanings and utterance - and be of them that know. Be steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord and turn not to the right or to the left, for this is indeed a great bounty. Abide beneath the shade of the Tree, taste of its fruits, and be of the thankful ones. Thus do We command thee, that thou mayest abandon what thy desires bid thee and take hold of what thy Lord commandeth thee. By God! This is better for thee, if thou be of them that act. And thou, O thou who art present before the Throne and gazing upon the Most Great Scene, rejoice within thyself for having been named Muhammad in the Kingdom of Names, and the Herald in the Supreme Dominion, and Mahmud before the Throne. Thus doth God single out for His grace whomsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Mighty, the Generous. Blessed art thou for having attained unto all good and its source, and for being among them that have attained, and for having drunk the choice sealed wine of grace from its fountain and source, and for being among the triumphant ones. God will soon manifest the excellence of that which thou hast attained and will reward thee for what thou hast wrought in His path, if thou act according to what thou hast been bidden by One All-Wise, All-Knowing. Thus hath the proof of thy Lord been perfected for thee and for those who have believed in God and His signs, and for all who dwell in the heavens and on earth. Thereupon the Pen of Command ceased its movement, due to a wisdom which none knoweth save God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Praise be unto Him in all conditions. There is none other God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and all shall return unto Him.</p>

<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who is single in majesty and unique in grandeur! He hath uttered the Word whereby the heavens of hearts and minds were raised up. Then He spoke another word, whereupon a light shone forth, and when the winds of will caught hold of it, it scattered and formed a dome across the face of heaven, and by each fragment thereof was illumined the heart of every one who turned towards Him and the breast of every one who set his face towards Him. Verily, He it is Who doeth what He willeth through His sovereignty and ordaineth what He pleaseth through His power. The conditions of the world cannot frustrate Him, nor can the intimations of the nations, nor can the might of those who have turned away from God, the Lord of the worlds, strike fear into Him. Praise be to God Who hath raised up the heaven of the Tablet and adorned it with the suns of words and the stars of letters, in each one of which surgeth an ocean of wisdom and inner meanings. Exalted be the Eternal Sovereign Who hath established Himself upon the Throne with a power that the might of the world hath failed to weaken and the doings of those who have risen up in opposition and manifested such hypocrisy as hath never appeared on the horizons cannot frustrate. To this testifieth the Tongue that speaketh on this Day of the Covenant. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath manifested from the horizon of heaven that which drew unto Him all who dwell in the kingdom of creation. Thereupon all things were stirred, every face was turned, every eye was fixed, every heart was drawn, and every foot hastened. Then He desired to test them, and thereby there rose from the horizon of destiny the sun of tribulation, whereat souls were troubled and pillars were shaken. Among the people were those who turned away after having advanced, those who feared after having been assured, those who retreated after having drawn nigh, those who became distant after having been near, those who paused after having proceeded, and those who weakened after having been strong, that thereby might be distinguished those who sought Him, detached from all directions. These are they whom neither the circumstances of destiny nor the manifestations of tribulation could hold back. They spoke with both outer and inner tongue, saying: “In Thy name, O Beloved of the world and Desire of the nations!” They hastened unto Him, nay rather, they soared on wings of certitude to the horizon of His grace and drank the choice wine of utterance from the hand of His bounty. These are servants who discovered the sweetness of remembrance and were seized by the intoxication of the Kawthar of knowledge which the fingers of their Lord, the All-Merciful, proffered unto them. Blessed are they, then blessed are they! Exalted is He Who hath appeared with this mighty grace and profound generosity.</p>
<p>I bear witness that there is no God but Him. He hath ever been in His loftiness and exaltation, sanctified above the description of His creatures and the mention of His servants. Hearts and minds cannot comprehend Him, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>Thereafter, O thou who hast drunk from the cup of utterance! The servant hath received what thou didst send by the hand of one of the loved ones. I read it and found therein the fragrance of your love for God, our Lord and your Lord, and your turning unto God, our Quest and your Quest. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to ordain for you the good of this world and the next and to vouchsafe unto you that whereby your mention shall be exalted in His days. Verily, He is the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>In Persian this is submitted so that the points may be made known and clear to each of the friends without veil or barrier, that perhaps through his honor’s efforts those servants who are seen to be wavering and disturbed by the might of oppression and tyranny may be adorned with the light of certitude and the ornament of assurance. This servant is deeply thoughtful, for he observes that at every moment the world testifies in its own tongue to its transience, yet for the sake of these fleeting two days all are deprived of the eternal Kingdom, save those souls who have drunk the wine of certitude from the hand of bounty. These are the [nigh-brought] servants, and these are they on whom shall come no fear, neither shall they grieve. We beseech God to grant all attentive ears that they may attain to the hearing of divine words. He is the true Bestower and the real Munificent One. Thus in certain Tablets this word hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will - exalted be His utterance: “Should anyone attain unto hearing the call of his Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, in the Kingdom of Creation, verily he would not remain in his place but would arise with wisdom and utterance to make mention of his Lord, the Mighty, the Praised.”</p>
<p>And likewise in other Tablets He saith, the meaning of which in Persian is this: Were the people of earth to attain to hearing the divine call, all would turn to the supreme horizon and drink of the most glorious wine. I swear by the ocean of divine knowledge that if they were to perceive with the true ear even one note from the melodies of the birds of the Throne, they would sacrifice their lives in the path of the Friend and would not return alive from the place of sacrifice, even as those who drank of the Kawthar of inner meanings did not return, and whatsoever they possessed of wealth and life and kindred they gave in the path of that Sun of Truth - how excellent is the reward of the doers!</p>
<p>Should a soul drink but a drop from the ocean of love, or attain unto a dewdrop from the sea of detachment, he would behold all the world as like unto a handful of dust, and whatsoever is in the heavens and earth would not hold him back from the path of the Friend. Some time ago a Tablet was revealed from the heaven of divine Will, and in that most holy, most exalted Tablet this passage was recorded by the Supreme Pen: “One effulgence from the Sun of detachment fell upon the kings; they passed beyond self and other and laid their heads in the wilderness. Among them was Nu’man, upon whom shone [one night] the Sun of the Word rising from the dayspring of detachment. He became thoughtful and bewildered, and when he emerged from the stupor of wonderment, he addressed himself to himself, saying: ‘What use are all these treasures and ornaments thou hast gathered, which tomorrow another shall possess, and another shall sit upon thy throne?’ In an instant the wine of detachment so attracted him that it brought him to a station where he passed beyond treasuries and riches, crown and throne, and all the means of pomp and sovereignty, and that very night he left his house and turned toward the wilderness. When morning came and the nobles were present, they found the throne of kingship without its king. However much they searched, they found no trace of him. And if today this station were to be manifested to all who dwell on earth, from the highest to the lowest, thou wouldst behold them all detached from all save God, for they would witness their own […]”</p>
<p>And if the lowest of these stations be manifested, behold ye all severed from aught else save God, for verily they would become cognizant of the transience and nothingness of the world, and would observe with the eye of insight that all people testify to the ephemeral nature of the world. However, this testimony hath no reality and hath not attained the station of being a true attribute, for if they were to truly comprehend and observe with the true eye, they would never deprive themselves of God’s infinite bounties on account of it. Most instances of seeing, speaking, hearing, and knowing are incidental, not real. Every person of insight beareth witness to these words, and every person of knowledge hath testified and continueth to testify to their truth. We beseech God to aid all people to hearken unto His blessed Word, that all may be purified from the turbidity of the world and its heedlessness, and may turn with heart and soul to the Dawning-Place of the Light of Oneness. Verily, He is the Bestower, the Answerer, the All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>O brother! The fire of God is ablaze and the light of God is dawning from the horizon of bounty. The ocean of grace is surging and the Sovereign of the unseen and seen is established upon the throne of manifestation. Yet all are heedless, bereft, extinguished and far removed. Nothing has prevented these souls except the evil deeds they have committed and perpetrated in the past. If one were to gaze upon the verses, they have filled the East and West of the earth - none has any excuse to turn away or object. And if one were to look upon the clear proofs and miracles, all things testify that there hath appeared through Him that which hath never appeared in creation. Beyond this, whatsoever hath appeared and will appear had been sent down and revealed from the Supreme Pen years before. This servant knoweth not whether your honor hath been blessed to witness the verses revealed in the Land of Mystery, Iraq, and the Most Great Prison or not. The blessed Surih of Ra’is was revealed at the time of departure from Adrianople - most of the companions witnessed and can testify to this, and that blessed Tablet is in the possession of many. Take it and observe how all that transpired in the Ottoman realm was explicitly recorded therein, detail by detail. Likewise in the Tablet of Paris, wherein mention of the sovereign of that land and what would befall him was revealed in detail from the Supreme Pen. Beyond these, whatsoever man may contemplate or imagine, even greater and more perfect examples thereof have appeared on earth. Nevertheless, the people, like unto spiders, weave webs of vain imaginings. They have turned away from the Truth and clung to falsehood without any clear proof or evidence. They have denied the Divine Testimony, before which all atoms bow down in humility, and have turned away from His proof, clinging instead to the sources of conjecture and fancy who are but the ignorant divines of the age. Fie upon them and upon those who follow them without any clear proof from God, the Exalted, the Great. In the Furqan, God - glorified and exalted be He - sayeth: “On the day when thy Lord cometh, or some of the signs of thy Lord,” and likewise: “The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the Worlds.” Many such verses exist in the Furqan, which distinguisheth truth from falsehood, and in previous Books as well. This evanescent servant hath repeatedly written and sent these verses in submissions to friends both past and present, therefore this letter shall suffice with brevity. We beseech God to sanctify the eyes of hearts and minds from the ophthalmia of vain imaginings, that they may be blessed to witness the effulgences of His Countenance after the passing away of all things. One word sufficeth the seeker - the fragrance of truth can be distinguished from it. The scent of the rose and aught else is clear and evident - any discerning one can tell them apart, provided the sense of smell hath not been altered by incidental conditions. But if, God forbid, the sense of smell be impaired, no distinction can be made. These are days when the sprinkling drops of the ocean of utterance have refreshed and quickened all created things, yet most of mankind, who regard themselves as the noblest of creatures, remain remote therefrom and are unaware. This is why it hath been said that if man manifests true humanity, he is superior to the angels.</p>
<p>They remain unaware. Thus it hath been said that if man manifesteth his true humanity, he is superior to the angels; but if he falls short thereof, he becomes lower than the beasts. It is hoped that thou wilt shine forth like unto a brilliant lamp and become the cause of awakening heedless souls.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about a Tablet revealed to one of the servants wherein this blessed verse from the Furqan was mentioned - His exalted Word: “And they thought as ye think, that God would not raise up any one after him” - and that in the verse the word “after” (min ba’d) does not appear, and that a learned person out of necessity asked several people that if the word “after” had been in the Qur’an the proof for this Most Great Manifestation would have been complete, but since the word “after” is not there, how can it be proven? O brother, I shall make one statement: if there be the slightest attention paid, it will suffice - the horizon of doubt will be transformed to certainty and the Sun of the Cause will shine forth in such wise that no trace of darkness will remain in existence. That statement is this: every seeker, every aspirant, every worker must first purify his heart from the suppositions and imaginings of people and, relying upon Him, arise to know the Truth, exalted be His glory, so that according to his capacity he may recognize and comprehend the Truth through Its attributes, signs, tokens, proofs and evidences. For that Ancient Ocean, that Sun of Truth, that Heaven of Bounty cannot be known in Its essence and reality - the Prophets have confessed their powerlessness, the sincere ones their perplexity, and those near unto God their remoteness. This station needeth no mention or explanation, for it is accepted by all and all people acknowledge and confess it. And since the birds of understanding and knowledge are incapable of soaring to that most exalted and supreme station, it hath been commanded to look unto the signs, that perchance each one according to his station and capacity may comprehend the true Creator. And whosoever attaineth unto this station and drinketh a drop from the ocean of knowledge - that is, attaineth unto the recognition of God and knoweth Him - in this case whatsoever He commandeth is acceptable, His decree is binding, and His bidding is effective. Consider this blessed word which declareth “He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” Those who acknowledge this blessed word are reckoned among the people of truth, and they are souls who have drunk of the wine of inner meanings and attained unto the luminous wine at the divine dawn. They are those who have not and will never say “how” and “why” regarding the Cause of God. But concerning the verse: firstly, no one knoweth what was in the Book of God aforetime; and secondly, if the first Speaker addeth to or diminisheth from His own words or verses, He hath been and is free to do so, for He is the One Who speaketh in the Tree, He is the One Who speaketh in the Furqan, He is the One Who speaketh in the Bayan, and He is the One Who speaketh in all Books, Scriptures and Psalms from the beginning that hath no beginning. Should anyone look into and ponder upon the Book of Certitude, which was revealed at the time of the appearance of the Luminary of the horizons from the horizon of Iraq, he will find himself independent. By the Sun of Truth, in that blessed Book are treasured the pearls of divine knowledge and concealed the oceans of recognition. Blessed is the state of him who with complete detachment turned unto it and attained thereunto. And the purpose of mentioning this blessed verse was that the people of this age might know […]</p>
<p>And the purpose of mentioning this blessed verse was that the people of this age might know and become aware that in past ages and bygone centuries, the people of those centuries also spoke according to the meaning of this verse, saying that no other Prophet would come and none would be raised up with a Message. And this meaning is conveyed whether or not the word “thereafter” appears in the outward text, for the meaning of the blessed verse becomes this: they supposed, just as you have supposed, that God would raise up no one. And the word “thereafter” was implicit in the verse, just as in another place He explicitly states - exalted be His utterance: “Joseph came to you aforetime with clear signs, yet ye ceased not to doubt of the message with which He came to you, until, when He died, ye said ‘God will by no means raise up a Messenger after Him.’ Thus doth God mislead him who is a transgressor, a doubter.” Observe that the meaning of that verse is exactly present in this verse - “thereafter” being implicit there and explicit here. And the purpose of mentioning “thereafter” in this verse was that those who turn away and object to the Cause of God might understand that in former times too, in every age when the Sun of Truth dawned from the Dayspring of manifestation, the servants of that age turned away and said that after their Prophet and their Book, none would be raised up. In brief, the mention of the word “thereafter” was for clarity of meaning, and in some blessed verses of the Furqan and previous Books, mention of what is implicit becomes necessary so that hearers might grasp the intent of the Speaker and comprehend the meaning of divine verses. For example, He says - exalted be His utterance: “We created you, then fashioned you, then said unto the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves.’” And it is established that the command to the angels to prostrate themselves came before creation. Therefore, when the divines wished to find a way to explain the meaning of the verse for the understanding and comprehension of the people, they said that the word “father” is implicit, so that the blessed verse becomes thus: “We created your father, then fashioned your father, then said unto the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves’” - meaning that We created and fashioned your father Adam, then commanded the angels to prostrate themselves before him. Were this servant to wish to mention examples of this from the glorious Word, he would have to compose a treatise and trouble your honor with reading it. Now your honor should mention to that learned person - that is, the one who said that if the word “thereafter” had been in the blessed verse, the proof would have applied to this most great Manifestation - to observe the second verse wherein the word “thereafter” is visible, manifest and evident. O brother, what was submitted was out of love for your honor; otherwise, those souls who are confirmed today, or who are in truth seeking the straight path, must know the Truth through the Truth and hold fast to His firm cord, for if they hold to aught else, they shall never attain to the ocean of knowledge nor be illumined by the rays of the Sun of Truth that shineth from the prison’s horizon. Ask all people what they say concerning the blessed verse which states “He doeth what He willeth” […]</p>
<p>And those who fail to be illumined by the rays of the Sun of Truth which shine forth from the Orient of the Prison ask ye of all people what they say concerning the blessed verse which declareth “He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.” Whatsoever God ordaineth is the Book, and all must turn unto Him. His is the tongue, His is the utterance, His is the Book. Whatsoever He ordaineth is truth, whatsoever He mentioneth is truth, whatsoever proceedeth from Him is truth. Should anyone hesitate or raise objections, he hath indeed strayed from the straight path of God. God willing, that learned one whom ye mentioned should observe with the eye of fairness that which hath been submitted, that perchance he may inhale the fragrance from the gardens of true knowledge and return to the holy city of “We belong unto God.” In one of the blessed Tablets this exalted word was revealed: “This is not the day for questions. It behoveth every soul, when he heareth the Call, to say: ‘Here am I, here am I, O Creator of the heavens and God of Names! I testify that Thou hast manifested the Dayspring of Thy Revelation and the Dawning-Place of Thy signs, and that which none knoweth save Thee. I beseech Thee not to abandon me to myself and my desires. O my Lord! All things testify to Thy wealth and to my poverty, and verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.’” This evanescent servant beseecheth God that He may aid all His servants in that which pleaseth Him. Verily He is the Bestower, the Answerer, the All-Bountiful. The honored Aqa Siyyid 333 [Ali-Akbar], upon him be the Glory of God, hath oft mentioned you to this servant. I hope that, God willing, you will be assisted to serve the Cause, that there may appear through you that which shall endure in the divine Kingdom. This servant was greatly pleased by the mention of the honored Siyyid, and I beseech God to increase his success at all times. Verily He is the Protector of those who do good.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Mulla Ja’far Naraqi, who prior to the Manifestation considered himself among the Letters of the Living of the Bayan, and who declared that everyone who followed the Bayan must meticulously calculate all their possessions and pay its Huquq, even on their clothing and attire, and some people at that time who accepted his word paid whatever amounts they could - whether the Ancient Beauty would accept what was given as Huququ’llah, or whether it must be recalculated and paid according to this Dispensation: When this matter was presented before the Most Holy Court, He stated that Mulla Ja’far had no permission from anyone and spoke and ruled according to his own desires. However, since those souls who paid did so for the sake of God and His Cause, they are therefore pardoned and it is not permissible to request payment from them again. And this Huquq that has been mentioned, whose ordinance has shone forth from the horizon of the divine Tablet - its benefit returns to the servants themselves. By the life of God! If they were to become aware of what is hidden and cognizant of the ocean of grace concealed within this ordinance, all people would spend whatever they possess in His path. Blessed is he who attains unto what God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, hath commanded.</p>
<p>O brother! From that very ruling of Mulla Ja’far it becomes evident that he had not inhaled a breath from the gardens of detachment. His example is like those who busy themselves with washing the dead while intent on plundering their clothes. The Command of God hath been revealed with joy and fragrance. Blessed is he who hath attained unto it, and woe unto the heedless! The Kitab-i-Aqdas, which was sent down from the holy heaven in previous years, remained concealed for a time and He did not command that it be sent to other lands. He stated that the ordinance of Huququ’llah was revealed in that Book, and this was due to God’s mercy and kindness, for after the servants became aware of what the All-Merciful had revealed therein, compliance with it would become obligatory upon all. Perhaps they might be reluctant to fulfill it, or something might occur to their hearts unbefitting these divine days. Later, petitions arrived at the Most Holy Court from most regions requesting the laws, and this servant sent them according to His command. However, He commanded that no one should request the Huquq. It is prescribed in the Book of God for each soul to pay it of their own accord with the utmost joy and delight. I beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist all to do what He loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about the poor, whether the Huququ’llah can be given to them or not: this matter depends on permission. Wherever Huququ’llah is collected, the details of it and of the poor must be presented. Verily, He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. For if general permission were given, it would not be free of differences and would cause difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding what you wrote about Haji Mirza Ahmad: until now no petition of intercession has arrived at the Most Holy Court from Jinab-i-Dhabih, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God. Yes, many of his petitions have arrived, but mention of intercession was not made in them, and this servant has no knowledge beyond this.</p>
<p>That which was sent as the Huququ’llah to the land of ?ad has been received. Regarding your desire to journey to the Most Holy Court, this was presented and He said that in all matters one must observe wisdom, for this firm commandment has been sent down from the heaven of divine ordinances. In this year wisdom does not permit it, and thereafter the matter is in His hands. This servant is grateful to the true Object of Worship for having aided you to recognize Him and serve His Cause. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Giver, the Generous. The glory from God, the Lord of the worlds, be upon you and your family.</p>
<p>It is requested that you convey greetings on behalf of this ephemeral one to the friends in that land and remind them not to be saddened by the oppression of the tyrants of the earth. Praise be to God, you have attained to that which cannot be equaled by anything visible or hidden on earth. Know the value of your station and do not let it slip from your grasp. Soon will the oppressive souls return to dust with a hundred thousand regrets and remorse, and from there descend to their destined place. Hold fast to wisdom and occupy yourselves with the remembrance of God. Death is ordained and inscribed for every soul, and when its time comes there shall be no delay. This occurs but once, and surely if it comes in the name of the Friend, in remembrance of the Friend, and in the path of the Friend, it will be most excellent, most perfect, most wondrous, most glorious, and most sweet. One who has drunk of this cup will fully comprehend the submission of this servant and will find its taste sweet to his soul.</p>
<p>The purpose of these passages is that they should act with wisdom, but not to such an extent that the Cause of God becomes entirely hidden among them and the fire of God is completely extinguished. They should be like the radiant morn and like the bright day, striving to manifest themselves among people through goodly deeds and spiritual qualities, for virtuous deeds have been and will continue to be the cause of the exaltation of God’s Cause, and likewise the cause of awakening the servants. Glory and praise be upon the loved ones of God who have attained the wine of steadfastness among the people, who have believed and turned to God, the Peerless, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O God of Names and Creator of heaven, O Thou Who dost attract all creation through Thy sweetest call! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the Concourse on High was attracted and the hearts of the inhabitants of the cities of eternity took flight, to send down from the heaven of Thy loving-kindness that which will gladden the hearts of Thy loved ones who answered when they heard Thy call, who turned to Thee when Thou made known to them Thy path, and who advanced when Thou guided them to Thy way and the horizon of Thy manifestation. O Lord! They are servants who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have borne hardships in Thy path. Thou seest them, O Beloved of all possibility, beneath the claws of the rebellious ones who have cast away Thy signs, disbelieved in Thy clear tokens, and turned away from Thy proof and Thy testimony. O Lord! The oppression of the tyrants has seized them in such wise that they are disturbed in Thy days, and tribulations have encompassed them from all directions after their having held fast to the cord of Thy loving-kindness. O Lord! Give them to drink from the Kawthar of Thy bounty, of which whoso partaketh shall neither be disturbed nor frightened by those in the land. Verily Thou art the Master of the servants and the Judge on the Day of Return. There is no God but Thee, the Triumphant, the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>

<p>In the Name of the one God, the Supreme Pen speaks: O Ali, give thanks to the Beloved of the worlds, for thou hast attained unto the fragrances of the divine days and drunk from the Living Waters. Preserve this lofty, most exalted station through the most great steadfastness, for the treacherous have ever been and continue to be lying in wait for the trustworthy. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s grace and cling to the hem of His All-Bountiful Name. We have heard thy call and have made mention of thee in this Most Holy, Most Sublime Tablet, that it may be a treasure for thee with the True Trustee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Thou didst make mention of thy father. Today all earthly ties are severed. God willing, thou wilt strive until thy connection to the Truth becomes firm. However, thou must treat thy father with the utmost love. Any action that would cause him harm or grief is not acceptable. Thus doth the Tongue of the Wronged One counsel thee from His mighty prison. This binding commandment hath been recorded by the True Pen in the Book of God from the earliest days. Act thou accordingly and be thou patient. All the souls mentioned have attained to the remembrance of God. God willing, ye shall recognize the value of this supreme bounty and be occupied with the remembrance of God. The Glory be upon thee and upon them.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Kind Lord! The Divine Pen has in most times been occupied with the mention of friends - that is, those souls who have hearkened to the Divine Call and have turned toward His horizon. Blessed are those servants who have attained unto the most great honor and who have arisen with heart and soul to serve the Cause. Praise be to God that that household has attained unto this bounty and been honored with this distinction. If a soul draws but one breath in the path of the Friend, it shall assuredly be recorded in the Book of God and neither extinction nor annihilation shall overtake it. Blessed be your hearts for having attained unto the love of God, and blessed be your eyes for having turned toward His luminous horizon. Hold this station in high regard. By the life of God, it is more precious than the rarest crimson stone, as attested by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Aziziyyih was present before the Face a few minutes ago. Praise be to God, she has been and will remain under the shadow of the Divine Lote-Tree. And the glad-tidings of the Tablet that will be revealed tonight was given to her. The glory be upon thee, O my handmaiden, and upon him who has become renowned among the servants for My love, and upon him who has been named Ahmad, and upon those who have testified to that which God, the Exalted, the Great, hath testified.</p>

<p>In My Name, the Stranger</p>
<p>The Book of God hath been sent down in truth, and the Tablet of God hath appeared from the Mother Book, and verily it proclaimeth: There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous. That which was hidden hath been revealed, and the Tongue hath spoken: There is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Beautiful. The sea hath testified to the Most Great Sea, and the sun to this Luminous Orb. The heaven hath borne witness to the Lord of Names, and the light to this Revelation whereby the horizon of the world hath been illumined. Thus doth the Greatest Name speak, yet the people remain behind a manifest veil. Verily We gave glad tidings unto all in the Bayan concerning these days, and took from each and every one, whether young or old, a covenant. Yet when the Promise came to pass, they arose in opposition. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Among them are those who turned away from God and objected to Him, uttering that which even the Jews did not utter when the Spirit came with manifest sovereignty. And among them are those who said He speaketh from desire, after We had called them to the supreme horizon and revealed that which lay hidden in the treasuries of God’s knowledge, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed art thou for having turned toward Him Who is wronged, at a time when every guilty oppressor turned away. The glory rest upon thee and upon whosoever hath clung to the hem of God, the Mighty, the Most Praiseworthy.</p>

<p>O Abdu’r-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God - The Request of a Spiritual Youth - He is the Hearer, the Answerer</p>
<p>The Book of God hath been sent down from the horizon of the heaven of the All-Merciful’s loving-kindness. Every possessor of hearing hath been enabled to hearken unto its call, and every possessor of hands hath been assisted to take hold of the Book, and every possessor of sight hath testified to the appearance of the Dawning-Place of divine revelation and the Dayspring of celestial verses. Yet wolves from all directions have launched their attack, emerging from the thickets of self and passion. This Wronged One hath at all times proclaimed before the faces of all the world that “The Truth is come,” and when the fragrances of revelation were diffused and the lights of the Cause shone forth from the horizon of lands, those who were concealed behind the veil attacked the Wronged One with the swords of hatred. Such is the state of the heedless and the deluded. We beseech God to protect thee and ordain for thee, from the Supreme Pen, the reward of attaining His presence. This Wronged One hath made mention, and continueth to make mention, of God’s loved ones, and hath sought the presence [of God] for all. Yet the oppressors have intervened, and this land is seen each day in a different state and appeareth in a different color. Praise be to God that thou art remembered in the prison and hast attained unto the verses of the Supreme Pen. Well is it with thee and with them that know.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Wronged One of the horizons!</p>
<p>The Book of God is at all times speaking, and the Sun of Truth is shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of the divine Command. Blessed is the soul whom neither the might of the oppressors nor the clamor of the deniers hath kept back from turning toward the Most Exalted Horizon. The Day is the Day of God - all must be focused on Him and detached from all else. One deed performed on this Day cannot be equaled by the deeds manifested in centuries and ages past. Blessed art thou for having attained unto that which was sent down in the Books of God. Thou hast indeed reached the ultimate goal and the most exalted summit, and turned toward Him when the people turned away. Thou hast attained the presence before His countenance, heard the Call, and achieved that which most of the servants have failed to achieve. Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! Unto Thee be praise for having guided me, taught me, caused me to know Thee, and fed me from the table of recognition, and given me to drink from the Kawthar of utterance. My Lord! I beseech Thee by Thyself and by Thy most great signs to assist me in that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book. Then make me and Thy loved ones to be among those who hold fast to the cord of wisdom and to that whereby the hearts of Thy servants are attracted. Then ordain for me that which will exalt me among Thy creation through Thy Name and make me rich through Thy riches. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>In the Name of Him Who speaketh between earth and heaven! This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto him who hath attained the Kawthar of certitude on the day whereon the foundations were shaken, and the earth was cleft, and the mountains passed away. Verily He hath appeared with the truth and hath revealed that which He desired through His command from His presence. Blessed is he who hath turned towards Him, and woe unto every denier and infidel. O concourse of the earth! Be fair in your judgment by God and follow not your selfish desires in this Cause which, when it appeared, caused the lights to shine forth. Have ye anything greater than that which God hath brought? Then bring it forth and tarry not, O dawning-places of idle fancies! That which ye possess hath been cast away and your carpet hath been rolled up. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book which is with Him. Say: Verily the Book speaketh, would ye but hearken, O people of understanding! And say: He Who revealed it speaketh - unto this testifieth every learned one who hath spoken the truth in the days of his Lord, the Master of the Return. The Hidden One hath appeared and calleth out, saying: “O peoples of the earth! Answer Him Who summoneth you to the Most Sublime Horizon. Beware lest the conditions of those who disbelieved in the Beginning and the Return veil you.” Thus have We illumined the horizon of the Tablet with the splendor of My Most Great Remembrance. Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance, and woe unto every heedless doubter. The Glory shining forth from the horizon of this heaven be upon thee and upon those who have laid hold on the hem of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>

<p>O Ahmad, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the Witnessing, the Hearing, the Answering One! This is a Book which the All-Merciful hath sent down unto all who are in the realm of possibility, that it may draw them nigh unto Him. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Bountiful. This is a Day wherein the shrill voice of My Most Exalted Pen hath been raised, calling the servants unto a station which God hath made the seat of His mighty throne. O concourse of His loved ones! The Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath taken His seat upon the throne of ‘He doeth whatsoever He willeth,’ despite every learned one who hath cast the truth behind his back and followed the manifestations of idle fancies - they who have violated God’s Covenant, the Lord of all worlds. My name Mahdi, upon whom be My Glory, hath sent thy letter into the presence of the Countenance, and the servant who standeth before the Throne presented it. Thereupon did the ocean of utterance surge before the faces of all religions, and there was sent down for thee that which will draw thee near unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Rejoice thou in this most great favor and supreme bounty, and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all mankind and Sovereign of both this world and the next, for having turned toward Thy servant from the direction of Thy Prison and revealed unto me that which hath diffused the fragrance of Thy garment amongst Thy servants. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I have turned toward Thee, holding fast unto Thee and detached from all else besides Thee. Ordain for me, through Thy grace and bounty, that which will preserve me from the doubts of such as have denied Thee and Thy signs. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>This is a Book which the Faithful Spirit hath sent down from before God, the Lord of the worlds. Whoso believeth in it hath attained unto all good, and he who disbelieveth is assuredly among the companions of the Fire. O concourse of friends! Hearken unto the call of God, the Lord of Names. He summoneth you and commandeth you to show forth the Most Great Steadfastness in this Cause whereby the feet of the mystics have slipped. The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of Names hath come, riding upon the clouds with manifest sovereignty. Say: Observe! Observe! O concourse of divines, and be not of the wrongdoers. Judge with fairness and be not of those who behold the signs yet deny them - these indeed are the transgressors. O ’Ali-Asghar! That which thou didst send hath arrived. We have accepted it as a token of Our grace, that thou mayest be thankful and be of those who praise. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world and Lord of the nations, for having remembered me in Thy Most Great Prison and for accepting what I sent unto Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous. We make mention of thee and of thy branch, as the Most Exalted Pen was turning toward the Land of Friends in the past year.

Reflect upon God’s favor and loving-kindness - He remembereth thee from the Most Great Prison with verses whose fragrance hath perfumed the world. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. Be steadfast in My Cause, arise to serve Me, and speak forth My beauteous praise. Let not the affairs of the world sadden thee and turn thee away from this Great Announcement. Say: O concourse of the earth! There hath appeared an Announcement around which circle all announcements, before whose presence every wise command doth speak. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you from the Creator of heaven. Cast away what ye have taken from the divines of idle fancy and take what hath been given you from God, the Lord of all worlds. Thus hath My tongue spoken when the Throne was established in this exalted station. Glory be upon thy brother who aided his Lord and attained unto acceptance in the early days, and heeded not in God’s path the blame of any blamer who turned away from God, the Mighty, the Praised. And upon thee and upon those who have held fast to the Book from the presence of One mighty, faithful.</p>

<p>This is a Book which the Ancient One hath sent down unto him who hath believed in God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, that He might cause him to soar in His atmosphere, to be drawn unto His verses, to speak forth His praise, and to arise to serve His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Say: O people! Fear ye God, then judge with fairness concerning that which hath appeared in truth from One Who is powerful and ancient. He speaketh not of His own desire, but rather from God, the Lord of the worlds. Beware lest the fervor of the Age of Ignorance prevent you from the Dayspring of God’s knowledge, the One, the All-Informed. The books of the people profit you not. Cast aside what they possess, holding fast unto the cord of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Every fire hath been extinguished and every light concealed, but the Fire kindled in the Tree of the Cause increaseth in its blaze and flame. Neither afflictions weakened it nor calamities made it afraid. He hath arisen to promote the Cause with a sovereignty that hath conquered all who are in the heavens and on earth. The river of utterance hath flowed from His right hand, and the ocean of knowledge surgeth before His countenance. Blessed is he who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto every heedless doubter. Thus hath the Tongue of the All-Merciful spoken in the garden, as a rebuke to the people of the Bayan who have denied the appearance of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Glory be unto the companions of Baha who have testified to that whereunto God hath testified that there is no God but Him, the All-Bountiful, the All-Generous.</p>

We summoned the servants unto God, the Lord of creation, whereupon the wolves of the earth gathered against Us until they imprisoned Us in this spot. All that is on earth was created for Our names, yet We were debarred therefrom, such that We had no place wherein to store what We possessed of the Books of God, the All-Governing, the Mighty, the Bestower. The Trusted One came to the Most Great Prison and desired to build a house or purchase land wherein might dwell he who had no shelter in the land. How many an evening did he pass in one abode, only to be driven forth by the hosts of the wicked at daybreak. He was in the hands of the evil ones most of the time, as doth the Lord of all men testify. At one time imprisoned, at another captive, then exiled, then in chains and fetters. We beseech God to make firm His loved ones in His Cause and to open hearts through this Name which He hath made the key to the treasuries of mysteries, and We beseech Him to grant thee success in that which thou art engaged and to strengthen thee in such wise that the machinations of every ignorant oppressor shall not sadden thee.</p>

I testify to Thy Manifestation and to Thy Books which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will, and to the movement of Thy Pen whereby Thou hast subdued the cities of hearts and souls. And I testify to Thy oneness and Thy singleness. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Possessor of existence and the Forgiver of sins, by the lights of Thy countenance through which the Sun of Thy bounty hath shone upon existence, and by Thy Most Great Name which hath encompassed the world, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the oppression of tyrants nor the injustice of pharaohs may frighten me.

<p>In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted. This is a Book sent down in truth from the kingdom of God’s will, the Most High, the Most Great. Indeed it is the ornament of the Tablets of creation and the exposition of what was sent down aforetime from the presence of the Mighty, the Generous. Say: Every word that proceeds from the mouth of God contains a treasury of meanings that none has ever discovered save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed are they who have taken the gems of what We have revealed and have cast aside interpretation in this mighty Revelation. Say: None knows the interpretation of the Book save God. It is not for anyone to speak of it or ponder it. Thus has the matter been decreed by One Who is mighty and powerful. Say: Take what We intend and the outward meanings of what We have revealed in the Book. This is better for you, if you be of those who understand. Behold the people of the Furqan - they interpreted but did not attain save those whom God aided with the truth. Thus does the All-Knowing teach you. The laws of wisdom and utterance have been scattered through the disagreements of the followers of religions - they are indeed among the distracted ones. Hold fast to the cord of unity, then hearken with a single ear to that which the Tongue of Grandeur speaks. Thus does the Lord of creation command you in this radiant dawn. When thou hast attained to the mention of the Remembered One, say: Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Beloved of those who remember Thee!</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down in truth and it speaketh before all faces: Verily I am the Wronged One, the Stranger. I have stood before the faces of the world and summoned all unto the All-Knowing Single One. Among them were those who denied, those who turned away, those who pronounced sentence to shed My radiant blood, and those who uttered that which caused the Concourse on High and the denizens of this exalted station to lament. O Muhammad, justice is lost and equity non-existent. This Wronged One, without veil or covering, summoned all parties to the truth in days when hearts and limbs trembled and quaked from fear of pharaohs and tyrants. When the Cause became somewhat manifest, the deniers of the Bayan emerged from behind the veil and rose up against the Lord of all beings, perpetrating that which no party among all parties had ever perpetrated. Ask thou of God that He may preserve thine own party, that perchance they may remain protected from the vain imaginings and idle fancies of the former party, namely the Shi’ih, and may attain unto the lights of true unity. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon whosoever hath heard the Call and responded - verily such a one is among the people of Baha in God’s Book, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Praise be to the Beloved of the world, that thou art attracted to His love, art gazing toward His horizon, art steadfast in His Cause and mindful of His remembrance. Thou must needs be so steadfast that if from the horizon of the Cause there should appear a decree contrary to the desire of all who are on earth, thou wouldst say in utmost steadfastness: “This indeed is the truth.” The mightiest of all things is steadfastness, and the greater the Cause, the more numerous its trials. If souls truly knew God doeth whatsoever He willeth, and were in truth assured of this blessed word, no one would ever object to the Truth. The Beloved said to His loved one: “Be thou steadfast as thou hast been commanded.” From this pure and blessed word the station of steadfastness and its greatness is evident and clear. God willing, mayest thou ever drink from this cup and attain unto this station. Thy mention hath been and is before the Throne. Be not saddened by conflicting matters.

<p>I know not, O my God, what the Fire is with which Thou didst light the Lamp of Thy Cause, or what the Glass wherewith Thou didst preserve it from Thine enemies. By Thy might! I marvel at the wonders of Thy Revelation, and at the tokens of Thy glory. I recognize, O Thou Who art my heart’s Desire, that were fire to be touched by water it would instantly be extinguished, whereas the Fire which Thou didst kindle can never go out, though all the seas of the earth be poured upon it. Should water at any time touch it, the hands of Thy power would, as decreed in Thy Tablets, transmute that water into a fuel that would feed its flame.</p>
<p>I, likewise, recognize, O my God, that every lamp, when exposed to the fury of the winds, must cease from burning. As to Thy Lamp, however, O Beloved of the worlds, I cannot think what power except Thy power could have kept it safe for so many years from the tempests that have continually been directed upon it by the rebellious among Thy creatures.</p>
<p>I swear by Thy glory, O my God! Thy Lamp which Thou didst light within the tabernacle of man crieth out to Thee and saith: “O Thou the one alone Beloved! How long wilt Thou forsake me? Lift me up to Thee, I pray Thee. Though this wish of mine be the wish of a human creature, yet Thou knowest that my true wish is to sacrifice myself in Thy path. Thou art He Who hath made my desire to be the same as Thy desire, and my will the same as Thy will. Do Thou preserve Thy loved ones, I beseech Thee, in the shelter of Thy shadowing mercy which transcendeth all things, that haply the sufferings they bear may not deter them from turning in the direction of Thy name, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.”</p>

<p>This is a Tablet revealed for the sister of the Sheikh who migrated from his self unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This is a Tablet for her who hath believed in her Lord and attained unto His days and was among the devout women. O handmaiden of God! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having caused thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self through His Most Exalted Name. Arise then to recognize this Beauty through Whom the earth was cleft asunder, the mountains were crushed, and the heavens were rent apart. By God! Through Him the letters were moved from their places and the words from their stations, and from the horizon of grace shone forth the Sun of verses. Remember thy Lord in His days, then bow down and be devout and be among those who prostrate. Be not perturbed when the bellowing of the Calf is raised and the veils of allusions prevent the people from drawing nigh unto the holy court. Cast behind thee all allusions and take fast hold of the cord of God. Verily He will protect thee from the thunderbolt of those days and draw thee nigh unto the heaven of attributes. Thus doth God make mention of thee in this Tablet and reveal unto thee that which shall sanctify thee from all that keepeth thee back from Him and draw thee nigh unto that which is better for thee than whatsoever hath been created between earth and heaven. And peace be upon thee and upon those women who have believed in God their Lord and were among the pure ones.</p>

Know thou the worth of that which thou hast attained, then relate unto the people that which thou hast heard and witnessed. Beware lest thou add or take away therefrom. Thus doth the Youth counsel thee from before the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Thy letter hath come before Us and We have taken note of its contents. Verily thy Lord is informed of all things, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth and whatsoever is concealed in the hearts of all the worlds. However, We conceal through Our forbearance and then Our mercy which hath preceded all things, and verily He is merciful unto His servants. We were with thee and thy companion and heard what he mentioned both secretly and openly, and verily thy Lord encompasseth all things. Nothing moveth save after His leave and with Him is the knowledge of all things preserved in a Book. Grieve thou not over anything.

<p>This is an epistle from the imprisoned Stranger to him who hath believed in God, the Mighty, the One, the Peerless. Worship none but Him. He, verily, suffices thee in truth. He is possessed of invincible strength. He aideth whom He willeth through His sovereignty, and He, verily, hath power over all things. His is the bounty and the grace, and He, verily, knoweth all things. Say: Verily He appeared aforetime under the name of ’Ali before Nabil, and in this Revelation under the name of Husayn before ’Ali. Say: This pertaineth to the Seven Letters, if ye be of them that know. And ye were promised Him in the Tablets of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say: He was, verily, the Herald of My Own Self - read ye the Bayan, that ye may be of them that understand. Say: Were it not for this One, that One would not have been, and He hath testified thereunto, whilst ye remain heedless. Say: He liveth in the All-Glorious Horizon. Blessed be He Who hath dawned from this luminous Horizon and hath proclaimed: “Noon-tide approacheth while ye slumber even as We found you among the slumberers.” Thus have We taught thee and cast upon thee that which sufficeth the worlds, would they but ponder upon this Cause for less than a moment. As to them that have disbelieved, nothing shall profit them save the punishment of thy Lord, and He, verily, is possessed of terrible might. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>

Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of knowledge and for having believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. We send Our greetings from this Spot unto thee and unto My handmaidens in that place, who have entered the stronghold of the providence of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of him who hath been named Nuru’llah and him who hath been named Zuhuru’llah, that they may rejoice in My gracious remembrance. Upon them both, and upon her who hath been named Kawkab, and upon every maidservant who hath believed in God, the Lord of all worlds, be the Glory.</p>

<p>Muhammad-Sadiq! In the name of the peerless Lord! Every soul that hath today drunk from the living waters and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon must needs walk among the servants in such wise that all will testify to his sanctity and detachment. The ornament of man hath ever been trustworthiness and godliness, and these pertain especially to such as are related to the Truth. It is observed today that if any of the souls who have accepted the Cause manifest the slightest transgression, this is attributed to the Truth. Glory be unto Him, glory be unto Him! Exalted be His station, sanctified be His Self, and holy be His Cause! The people are heedless and deprived of the effulgences of the Sun of Truth. Where is the eye that can see, and where the ear that can hear the utterance of the Friend? What regret and remorse, that the Concourse on High and the dwellers of the Kingdom and the Realm of Might are all adorned today with the ornament of His manifestation - that is, they have attained to His recognition and knowledge - while most of the people of the earth remain veiled by the veils of fancy and debarred by the signs of idle imaginings. We beseech God to aid you and the other friends in that which is His good-pleasure. By My life! This indeed is a mighty grace, an exalted station, a noble seat, and a manifest refuge.</p>

God hath prescribed for all people to visit this Most Great Shrine, which He hath forbidden unto those who have disbelieved and associated partners with Him, and which He hath specifically reserved for those servants who have turned unto Him in humility and penitence. Hearken unto My words: Free thyself from the world, then enter into the wilderness of detachment, the place wherein the lights of Beauty have dawned forth with the sovereignty of grandeur and majesty, that thou mayest discover that which no one else hath discovered. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto those possessed of understanding. Leave all creation behind thee and say: In the Name of God and by God, then traverse the path with the power of God, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the All-Bestowing. Purpose for thyself naught except what God hath purposed and willed, for He desireth for no one save that which will distance him from self and passion and draw him nigh unto the Manifestation of His Self, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious. God sufficeth as a witness, and he who possesseth knowledge of the Book. Detach thyself from the murky and perishable water, then take in thy right hand the everlasting and eternal cup and drink therefrom. By God!

Thou art among My handmaidens concerning whom My Most Exalted Pen hath moved and concerning whose tribulations the denizens of the cities of names have spoken. Blessed art thou, O My handmaiden, for the sorrows that have overtaken thee in the path of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. O handmaiden! Though the women of the world were, according to their own claims, occupied with the remembrance of God throughout the nights and days, they did not attain unto the blessed word “O My handmaiden,” while thou, through the bounty of the True Sovereign, hast attained unto it time and again. We counsel thee to patience and steadfastness. The world was not and is not worthy of mention. God willing, thou shalt manifest thyself in such wise that its conditions shall neither disturb nor sadden thee. Dwell within the pavilion of the protection of God and fix thy gaze upon His horizon.

Although outwardly We did not meet, yet God the All-Knowing beareth witness that thou hast been and wilt continue to be beneath the glance of His favor. This is a Day wherein divine bounties, like unto torrential rain, are streaming down and descending. How excellent is the state of the soul that hath turned towards Him, and the heart that hath been drawn to Him. We have summoned the whole world through the Most Great Name. Some have hearkened and been blessed with the holy word “yea,” while others have turned away and risen up with utmost determination to afflict this Wronged One. For numbered years hath this Wronged One been caught in the hands of the oppressors - at times imprisoned, at times in jail, and other afflictions which none knoweth save the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. God willing, thou wilt inhale from these wondrous and exalted words the fragrance of the garment of Revelation, and in all conditions wilt speak in praise and glorification of the Wronged One of the horizons. Verily, He is with His servants who remember Him and are steadfast. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>O noble master and distinguished presence! The servant has been favored by your verses and I beseech the Most High that through them He may reform the order of the world and the laws of nations, for they were as pure gold from the mine of the love of God. Praise be to God, you have spent all your days in praise of the Lord of Names. A hundred thousand lifetimes could not and will not equal a single hour of your life, for it was and is spent in praise and glorification of God. We beseech the Truth to confirm all in that which is befitting and worthy. And furthermore, the pearls of the sea of your love were presented before His face and were favored with the glance of His grace. He said: “God willing, may he be confirmed. O Nabil! We have heard what you uttered and presented and sent, and We pronounce Our greater blessing upon you and upon My loved ones and upon him who was named with your name and upon him who is with him and upon every traveler who has migrated in the path of God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. Praise be to God, the King of this promised Day.” End. With utmost sincerity I extend greetings to each of the masters and beloved ones who are blessed and honored with the love and remembrance of God. Glory be upon your presence and upon them.</p>

<p>O servant! Hear My call, then grieve thou with My grief and imprisonment. By God! No greater tribulation hath befallen My soul than that which hath befallen My loved ones, if ye be of them that understand. Verily, they who have been martyred in the path of God - these hath God made detached from all else save Him and caused them to ascend unto a station of glorious honor. And now the angels of Paradise circle round them with chalices of Kawthar and Salsabil. Would that I were with them and had attained unto the Most Exalted Companion in the presence of thy Lord’s mercy, the Mighty, the All-Praised! But as for him who sowed corruption and killed - verily he hath met the recompense of his deeds, for by his action were troubled the hearts of them that profess the unity of God. And they who were slain, having committed no wrong - round them circle the denizens of the highest Paradise at eventide and at dawn, offering up their very souls in their path, while the people of the Concourse of the near ones derive light from their countenances. How blessed are they in having attained unto the mercy of their Lord and in being numbered among the martyrs! As for thee, render thanks unto thy Lord and grieve not for aught, for He sufficeth thee above all created things. Find sufficiency in Him rather than in aught else, and associate not any partner with Him, for verily He is One in His essence and then in His actions, were ye of them that know. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon the steadfast servants of God.</p>

<p>O servant! Conduct thyself with justice and act in such wise that thy deeds may reveal the sanctity of the Cause. Adorn thyself with so praiseworthy a character, that by it the fragrance of purity may be wafted over all men. Quaff thou the wine that is life indeed from the living fountain of Mine utterance, and let thy sustenance be My remembrance and My praise. Thus biddeth you He Who holdeth the knowledge of all things in the unerring Book.</p>

This Wronged One seeks forgiveness on your behalf for what you mentioned, for you have asked for that which An-Nadr ibn al-Harith and a group of polytheists asked of the Messenger of God - may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for Him. One asked for a house of gold, another for a garden of fruits in an arid land, and yet another requested flowing canals. And God, exalted be His glory, rejected them all. Now you have asked for that which the heedless ones of the world asked for in those days. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. Pass beyond vain imaginings and set your face toward the Dayspring of certitude.

Yet after the manifestation of Truth and the appearance of clear proofs and the revelation of signs, it is observed that most have remained far from what God desireth. They acknowledge that “He doeth what He willeth,” yet they question His actions with “why” and “wherefore.” They recognize that “He ordaineth what He pleaseth,” yet they hesitate regarding that which hath appeared from Him. Whatsoever proceedeth from God, glorified be His majesty, hath been and shall ever be beloved by the sincere ones and those drawn nigh. No friend would ever exchange the actions of his friend for all the world - how much less that which proceedeth from God, exalted be His glory and greatness! Were He to decree existence for that which hath no existence, or were He to apply the law of evanescence to that which endureth, none hath the right to say “why” or “wherefore.” Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken, that thou mayest hear and be of those who know.</p>

I beseech Thee by Thy Kingdom and Thy Dominion and by the mysteries of the Book of Thine own Self, to make me steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of every learned one have slipped, the heart of every mystic hath been perturbed, and every proud oppressor hath lamented. The glory rest upon thee and upon those who have heard and responded to their Lord, the Mighty, the Great.

The promise hath come to pass and the Truth hath appeared - praise ye God for this great bounty. How many a servant hath been prevented by the world from the Lord of Names, and how many a servant hath turned and attained unto the recognition of God, the Lord of the worlds. O Samad, the Wronged One hath made mention of thee and hath answered thee through this perspicuous Book. O Husayn, hearken unto the call of the Wronged One from the precincts of His Most Great Prison. He calleth thee by virtue of thy having turned unto Him from thy distant station. O Muhsin, rejoice in that the Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of thee as it moveth in this lofty palace which was built aforetime and which God hath adorned with His Name and made it a station for His Self, the One Who ruleth over the worlds. O Faraj, act in accordance with what God hath sent down in His mighty Book, then thank Him for having made mention of thee whilst He was imprisoned at the hands of the heedless ones.

Thou hast ever been, O my God, sanctified from the conditions of Thy creation and exalted above the hints of Thy creatures.

Among them are those who have heard and turned towards Thee, and among them are those who, when they heard, turned away and denied Thy proof and disbelieved in Thy signs. O Lord!

I beseech Thee by the arms of Thy power and the manifestations of Thy might to preserve them from the evil of the enemies of Thy Self and to grant them, through Thy bounty and Thy gifts, the good of this world and of the world to come. O Lord! Thou art the Strong and they are the weak before Thy gate. Assist them in Thy remembrance and praise and in that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Book.

<p>O Ali, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing!</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who hath sent down from the clouds of His bounty upon His servants and people of His lands the rain of wisdom and utterance, and hath acquainted them with His Straight Path and His Great News, through which the Herald proclaimed: “By God! The Lord of creation hath come with a sovereignty that hath encompassed all in the heavens and on earth.” Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire and laid hold of guidance, despite every heedless and remote one.</p>
<p>O thou who art mentioned before the Prisoner! The Promise hath come, and the Promised One proclaimeth with the most exalted call: “O concourse of earth and heaven! Fear ye the Lord of all mankind, and be not of the wrongdoers.” This is the Day whereon He Who conversed on Sinai hath been established upon the throne of Revelation, and that which was hidden in God’s knowledge, the Lord of all worlds, hath been made manifest. We beseech God to aid thee to remember and praise Him, and to make thee steadfast in this Cause whereby the feet of every heedless doubter have slipped.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My bounty be upon thee and upon those who have cast away the scroll of Satan and taken hold of the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. Praise be to God, the Lord of this most exalted station and the Sovereign of the sublime Seat!</p>

Nevertheless, most people are observed to be veiled and heedless. Indeed, not every ear is worthy to hearken to the divine call, and not every face has been or will be worthy to turn [towards Him], save souls that are assured, content, and well-pleasing. These souls have ever been and shall ever be recipients of divine favors and are mentioned in the presence of the Throne. Verily, be not grieved by anything, trust in God, thy Lord, in all matters, then be assured through the grace of thy Master. He remembereth thee as He remembered thee before. Bear thou witness at all times to that which God hath testified - that there is none other God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Praise be to God that thou hast inhaled the fragrance of the divine Shirt and turned towards the true Ka’bih. This is the King of deeds and the Sovereign of actions. Thou shouldst in all conditions be grateful to the exalted Truth that He adorned thee with the ornament of His love and caused thee to attain unto the horizon of His knowledge.

We counsel thee and those who have believed to observe wisdom, lest there be raised the clamor of the idolaters who have pronounced judgment against the Dayspring of Revelation and perpetrated that which hath caused the Messengers to lament. Hold thou fast unto the cord of wisdom in all conditions, and grasp the hem of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful. He, verily, hath forgiven him who hath turned towards Him, and hath seized every obstinate oppressor. Soon shall the world pass away, and the tyranny of those who have wronged, and that wherein every remote ignorant one taketh pride. Say: We have abandoned vain imaginings unto you, and have taken what We were commanded in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: We have abandoned the carrion, inasmuch as the heavenly table hath been sent down from the heaven of the bounty of our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Fear ye God, O concourse of the ignorant ones! Deal fairly in that which hath appeared with truth, and be not of the losers. Return ye, then repent; He will forgive you and absolve you of your evil deeds as a token of His grace, for He is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Thus have We sent down unto thee that which will solace thine eyes and the eyes of those who have turned towards God in this wondrous Day.</p>

<p>O Mahdi, son of him who ascended! Upon both of you be the Glory of God. He is the All-Knowing Witness. Verily the Torah cries out saying: “He Who revealed Me has come with His mighty signs. Turn unto Him, O concourse of Jews!” The Gospel exclaims: “He has come from heaven, He through Whose mention God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, adorned His Book.” And the Qur’an calls humanity unto the Truth Who was promised by the Most Exalted Pen in a preserved tablet. O peoples! The Lord of Destiny has come to draw you nigh unto a station which God has sanctified from the dawning-places of idle fancies. O People of the Book! Judge fairly concerning that which has appeared in truth, and follow not the desires of those who denied God’s proof and His evidence, and violated their covenant in the presence of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Will your riches profit you? No, by the Lord of the Final End! Will what you possess protect you? No, by My Name, the All-Compelling, the Mighty, the All-Loving! Cast aside what the people possess and take what you are commanded by God, the Lord of existence. Thus have We caused thee to hear the flowing waters of divine knowledge.

By God, the All-Bestowing One hath come with a sovereignty before which neither the hosts of the heavens nor of the earth can stand. Fear ye God and be not of the wrongdoers. This is the Day which Muhammad, the Messenger of God, foretold in the Qur’an, and before Him the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. He spoke, and His word is the truth: ‘The Day when the heaven shall give forth a manifest smoke.’ Say: O people! Deny not the proof of God and His evidence. Answer Him Who calleth you with verses which none deny save those who have turned away by following every ignorant remote one. Verily today the Call is raised and the verses speak the truth, yet most of the people are heedless. When thou hearest the Call from the supreme horizon, give thanks unto God, thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne. Say: Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to turn toward Thee when Thy servants turned away, and for having guided me to the Path when most of Thy creation denied Thy Manifestation.

Do we hear Thy cry from the dark pit, or do we see Thee under chains and fetters through what the hands of the enemies have wrought? Would that I knew who is with Thee, who consoleth Thee, and who companioneth Thee in Thy tribulation.” We have heard all that he hath uttered, and We have been patient, for We are the All-Patient, the All-Forbearing.

By God! The hearing ear perceiveth from all things their lamentation and their cry by reason of what hath befallen the Manifestation of the Self of the All-Merciful through sorrows, yet most of the people are heedless.

<p>O ’Ali-Qabli-Akbar, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Most Mighty, the Most Glorious. We entered into prison and summoned all to God, the Lord of Lords, and made manifest the Cause and revealed verses in such wise that the fragrances of the Revelation encompassed all regions. When the throne was established and the standard of the Bayan was raised throughout the lands, he who had remained hidden behind the veil emerged and proclaimed: “I am the lord of earth and heaven!” By God! He desired to slay Me. When his plot was exposed, he raised an outcry against his own self, as witnessed by those who were with Me, and beyond them by the Mother Book which is with Him. We concealed his deeds and protected him as a token of Our grace, for verily We are the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. O Pen! Leave off mention of him and those who followed him, and make mention instead of him who hath turned unto thee and believed in God, the Lord of creation. Thou wert created to make mention of God and His loved ones. Rejoice thou in this and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of eternity, and glory be unto Thee, O Master of final return!” Blessed art thou for having remained faithful to the Covenant when most of the servants broke it. Thus have We made mention of thee and called out to thee while We were in the Most Great Prison in the most desolate of lands.</p>

<p>O Muhammad-’Ali, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon.</p>
<p>We have mentioned thee before, and at this hour when sorrows have encompassed Us from every side through that which the hands of the wicked have wrought, hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree: Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. He hath appeared and revealed that which draweth the servants nigh unto the most exalted horizon and guideth them to the straight path. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the verses of My Pen and held fast unto the cord of My love and turned toward My direction while the people were in a strange slumber. Their vain desires have withheld them from Him Who created them. Thus hath the Wronged One spoken in this Prison wherein the Herald proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords. We counsel thee and My loved ones there to observe that wisdom whose decree hath been sent down in the Scriptures and Tablets. Blessed art thou for having cast away that which was with the divines and taken what came unto thee from God, the Lord of creation. We beseech God to assist thee to preserve this most exalted station and draw thee nigh unto Him at all times. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon those who have turned to the Source of the Cause when it appeared with power and sovereignty.</p>

Say: Blessed are ye, inasmuch as ye have turned to the Most Great Ocean and have heard, for the sake of God, the blame of every blamer and the opposition of those who turned away from the News that was recorded in the Books of God, the Lord of the worlds. By God’s life! No Prophet hath been sent except that He hath given glad-tidings of this Revelation. Thus was the matter decreed, but the people are in evident veils.

Beware lest the conditions of the world prevent you from the Lord of Names, or the doubts of the divines bar you from this Wise Remembrance.

Happy art thou, and again happy art thou! Drink of this living water in the name of the Sovereign of divine knowledge during this resplendent Dawn-tide. Blessed are those who drink therefrom. All praise be to the Desired One, Who through a single draught of the wine of His love hath so intoxicated the lovers of the world that they have passed by themselves and all else and hastened directly to the goodly city of “but Him,” subsequent to their negation of the veils of “No God is there.” They are the ones who, through the reviving breath of the Word of God, have attained everlasting and eternal life. These are the people, who as soon as they heard the call issuing from court of grandeur, declared “Yea, verily, yea, verily, O God of the worlds!”</p>

It is clear and evident that this mention hath been and will ever be purely for the sake of God, sanctified from all ulterior motives and vain imaginings.

For verily this mention shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven shall endure. Shouldst thou become aware of its station and recognize its worth, hearken then unto the voice of the Friend and strive that perchance thou mayest succeed in that which is pleasing unto the Friend.

And if for a moment he should deviate from the shadow of the Cause, he would be utter nothingness. Say: O people! All besides Me have been created by My Word. Verily, he and his like are among those whom God hath caused to grow from this Tree. They are the clouds of mercy and the rain-clouds of grace and the lamps of guidance and My guides among all creatures, should they remain firm in My Cause. And thy Lord hath taken unto Himself no partner, nor any peer, nor any minister, nor any likeness, nor any equal, nor any opposite, nor any similitude. Thus hath the decree shone forth and the matter been ordained from before God, the Most High, the Most Great.</p>

<p>His Holiness Mirza Abbas Shirazi, upon him be 966 [Baha’u’llah]</p>
<p>By God! The Day hath come, yet the people perceive it not. We have sent down the verses and made manifest the clear proofs, yet most of the people recognize them not. They have cast the path of God behind their backs, clinging to the ropes of the manifestations of idle fancies and vain imaginings. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of love and affection. We beseech God, the Lord of creation, to aid thee and assist thee to attain such steadfastness that its fragrance may spread throughout all lands. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Mighty, the Loving. O Abbas! Rejoice in this Tablet from which the fragrance of the utterance of God, the Lord of existence, hath been wafted. We have recognized what thou didst intend and heard what thou didst cry out in the days of thy Lord, the Possessor of the seen and the unseen. We granted permission regarding what the hands of those who denied the Witness and the Witnessed had earned. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee the reward of attaining His presence and to write down for thee what beseemeth His generosity, which hath encompassed the kingdom of earth and heaven. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth, as a favor from Us, for I am, verily, powerful over whatsoever I will through My word “Be,” and it is.</p>

Say: O people, commit not that whereby the honor of the Cause will be lost among the heedless servants. Say: O My loved ones, take heed lest ye spread corruption in the land after its reformation. Be ye the trustees of God on earth and His chosen ones amidst the idolaters. Beware lest ye shed blood, for God hath forbidden this unto you in the Tablets of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Omnipotent. Say: Whosoever sheddeth the blood of any one, he is not of Me and God is quit of him. Thus hath the command been revealed in a preserved Tablet. Sanctify yourselves from whatsoever ye have been forbidden in the Book from One Who is Mighty, All-Wise. Say: O people, follow ye the ways of God and His religion, and dispute not about His verses, and be ye not of the wrongdoers. Whoso wrongeth anyone hath indeed neglected the remembrance of God and is accounted among the losers. And thou, render thanks unto God for that the Pen of Command from this repentant, penitent servant hath moved to make mention of thee. And mercy be upon thee and upon God’s sincere servants.</p>

<p>O Kazim! In the letter ?ad: Blessed is He Who hath ordained for those near unto Him to drink from the chalices of mighty tribulation, and Who hath purchased from the believers their souls in exchange for the manifestation of a clear Name. Thus hath His way ever been with His sincere servants. O people of God! Grieve not for what hath befallen Us in this great calamity, for God shall soon requite His servants with truth and raise up His Cause above all who dwell in the kingdom of command and creation. This is what the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days, hath prescribed for Himself. Say: O people! Would ye banish a man for saying ‘My Lord is God,’ when he hath come to you with a clear proof that all who are in the heavens and earth are powerless to produce? Yet ye answered him not concerning his Cause and remained heedless of him until he departed from your lands with profound sorrow. By this were consumed the hearts of the pure maidens in their lofty chambers, and the eyes of the denizens of Paradise wept morn and eve. Yet do We thank God, Our Beloved, for all that hath befallen Us of wondrous and impregnable tribulations.

<p>In the name of the Beloved of the world! At all times the living waters flow and stream forth from the Pen of the All-Merciful, yet heedless souls remain veiled and deprived thereof. Strange it is that, although God, exalted and glorified be He, hath bestowed sight and consciousness and taste, sweet and fresh water appeareth to them the same as salt and bitter - nay, the latter is deemed more excellent and preferable. As can be plainly observed, they have forsaken the Most Great Ocean and turned instead to putrid waters that have stagnated for years in the pool of self. Evil is that which they have wrought, and they shall have no portion of this Great Sea. Discrimination hath vanished and justice hath perished.

Beseech ye God and supplicate Him in utter humility and lowliness that He may not deprive His servants of their own Day and may enable them to attain unto that which was intended.

Let not the loved ones of God be saddened by the conflicts of the world. Soon shall they behold themselves in the most exalted station.

<p>His Holiness the Name of Bounty (upon Him be 9 66 [Baha’u’llah]) on 19 Ramadan 1303:</p>
<p>Your beloved handwriting arrived - it was a new bounty bestowed during the days of fasting. Every particle has its suitable and befitting sustenance. The sustenance of the heart is without doubt the manifestation of love and affection of the masters and friends - of this there is no doubt. And the table of this pure, holy, spiritual bounty is correspondence. This adornment is specific to Him - He giveth as He willeth and is not asked of what He doeth. Writing and paper associated with the friends has attained this station; what then must their own station be? The knowledge is with Him. Now that the world is not capable of this manifestation, as it is narrow and base, God willing the days of expansion will come and the hidden things will be revealed and the concealed stations will raise their banners in the realm of knowledge. This is truth, there is no doubt in it. Regarding the matters you wrote about, God willing letters and Tablets will be sent. Concerning the feast they said to seek what - verily God is with the patient ones. God willing it will be arranged. Convey greetings and praise to all. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings.</p>

God maketh mention of His handmaiden among His handmaidens, that she may rejoice within herself and be gladdened by the remembrance of God. Yet He Who loveth the gladness of His servants - by God, the Truth! - is in great sorrow from the arrows that have been loosed against Him by the enemies who were created by His Word, and God is witness to this. O handmaiden of God! Remember thy Lord, then be devoutly obedient and prostrate thyself, that thou mayest be numbered among those handmaidens who are mentioned as devout in the Tablets. Purify thy heart through the love of God, thy Lord, for by it are all worlds purified. Hold fast to the cord of God, then enter beneath the shadow of protection which hath been preserved from all doubt. Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Remembrance to illumine my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and to sanctify me from all that Thy good-pleasure abhorreth. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth, and Thou art, of a truth, powerful over all things. And the glory be upon thee and upon those handmaidens who have believed in God and sanctified their souls from all that God abhorreth, and this is indeed a mighty favor.

Do they imagine themselves to be the people of guidance? Nay, by thy Lord, the Most Glorious! Soon shall they behold themselves in the abyss of divine wrath and shall find for themselves no helper. We summoned them unto that which profiteth them, yet they pant after Me, and God is well aware of what I say. How many nights did the people slumber while the Name of the Self-Subsisting was bound in chains and fetters through what the hands of the unbelievers had wrought, and they were far removed from the precincts of justice. By My life! Tribulation hath become the companion of Baha in the path of God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Thus was the matter decreed in a Tablet that was preserved before the Throne. Blessed is he who hath turned his gaze toward the Most Great Vision and hath been illumined by this Dawn that hath been made visible from the horizon of the Command.

Blessed is he who hath turned and attained unto the Word of God, and woe betide the most lost ones who cling to what they have, turning away from that which is with God, the Sovereign of this wondrous Day. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou didst turn and hearken and respond to Him from Whom the divines of the earth have turned aside, save those who drank the choice wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Almighty.</p>

To this beareth witness the Lord of Names, Who speaketh in this noble station.

Verily, He is the Speaker on Sinai and the Manifestation of Revelation, yet most of the people are heedless. Say: O my God, my Lord, my Beloved, my Goal and my Hope! I beseech Thee by the Word through which the trumpet was sounded and the dwellers of the graves arose, and through which the limbs of the mighty trembled, and through which the earth quaked and the mountains were crushed, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, for Thy Most Exalted Pen hath testified to its greatness in Thy Scriptures and Tablets. O Lord! Withhold not from me that which Thou hast ordained through Thy grace, and ordain for me the reward of those who have attained unto Thy presence and drunk the choice wine of reunion with Thee. Thou art He Who doeth what He pleaseth through His sovereignty and decreeth what He willeth. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>

When he reached the shore of the sea, We commanded him to return with Our servant, the Exalted One, and We prevented him from arriving because of that which the hands of the oppressors had wrought. O servant! Blessed art thou for having hearkened unto the command of God and for having attained unto that which thou wast bidden by One Who is mighty and wise. We have ordained for thee the recompense of that which thou didst perform in His path. He is verily the Protector of the doers of good. We have accepted thy migration and thy turning unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Rejoice thou in these glad-tidings which have shone forth and dawned from the finger of thy Lord’s will, the Ancient of Days. Be thou not grieved at thy return, for it is the very essence of return, in that thou didst follow therein the decree of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Blessed art thou and blessed are they who see not their own pleasure but rather the good-pleasure of God and that which He hath desired in a mighty tablet.

<p>Glorified is He Who mentions whomsoever He willeth as a grace from His presence. Verily He is the All-Mentioning, the All-Knowing. We have mentioned thee before and will mention thee hereafter, and We mention thee at this time in this Clear Tablet. Thou art he who hath shown patience in the Decree of God and His Command, and turned unto the Countenance when most of mankind turned away from it. To this testifieth every fair-minded and informed one. The people have turned away from God and His proof, and have disputed His verses until they hamstrung the She-Camel of God with grievous wrong. By God! They have committed that which Abu-Jahl did not commit against Muhammad the Messenger of God. Thus doth the All-Knowing inform thee. They have cast aside My laws after I came to them from the Dayspring of the Command with an authority that the clamor of the infidels could not withstand. Thou didst arise to promote the Cause and didst call all unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Among the people were those who were attracted by the Call of God, and among them were those who denied Him, following every rebellious devil. Blessed art thou for having attained unto My days and for having moved My Pen to make mention of thee. Rejoice thou and say: “Thine be the praise, O Thou Who art wronged, and Thine be the glory, O Thou Who art the Beloved of them that know!”</p>

He sent forth Adam and bestowed upon him a Book, and likewise unto Seth and Enoch and Abraham - upon them be the blessings and mercy of God - and unto all the other Prophets He granted whatsoever He willed. And unto the Messengers of firm resolve He sent down Books - the Torah, the Psalms, the Gospel and the Qur’an. And this Most Great Revelation, which is mentioned and promised in all the divine Books, hath brought that which equalleth all previous Books. Its verses have encompassed the world and its evidences have left no room for denial. Nevertheless, some among the people of the Bayan who are builders of the houses of vain imaginings and idle fancies have turned away. By God’s life! They are the most abject of all the world’s peoples. They cling to vain imaginings and hold fast to idle fancies. God protect us and you from the evil of such as these. Take hold of the Book of God with the hand of might and arise to serve His Cause. This is the counsel of the Wronged One.

We have seen thee standing in service to the Cause and have made mention of thee as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Be as thou wert before - thus doth thy Lord, the Generous, counsel thee. Preserve thy station through the Name of thy Lord and place thy trust in Him under all conditions. Soon shalt thou find that which hath been ordained for thee in My Mighty Book.</p>

<p>O Mirza Ghulam-Husayn, upon him be the glory of God! He is the One Who speaketh from the Divine Lote-Tree. God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath appeared and manifested His Cause as He hath willed and desired, and He is the One sought after in the beginning and the end. We make mention of those who have believed in the clear signs whereby the fragrance of the Bayan hath been wafted throughout all creation. Glorified be the All-Merciful, the Manifestation of this momentous News! Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One, and He hath revealed for thee that which hath caused the sweet savors of the days of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, to be diffused abroad. We counsel thee and them that have believed to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in this Cause whereby hearts have lamented and livers have melted. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the mention of God and His Tablet. He is indeed among the most exalted of creation in the Books and Tablets. We counsel thee to preserve this station lest every aggressive liar gain knowledge thereof. When thou hast attained unto the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, say: Blessed be He Who hath turned toward His servant from the direction of the Prison and revealed unto him that which cannot be equaled by whatsoever is with all mankind.

<p>O Mashhadi Abbas, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Wise Expositor. God beareth witness that there is none other God but Him. He hath ever been in the loftiest heights of exaltation and the most sublime realms of transcendence, and will forever continue to be as He hath been. He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He hath appeared and made manifest His Cause, whereupon the divines who disdained to worship the Lord of Names denied it. These are indeed the people of the veil. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs and followed every heedless doubter, save those who cast away vain imaginings, turning toward the Supreme Horizon. These are they who are endowed with true vision in the Book of God, the Lord of lords. This is the Day wherein the ocean of knowledge hath appeared, yet the people remain in strange drunkenness.

He is the One through Whom the luminary of His Most Great Name has shone forth from the horizon of the world, through Whom the river of wisdom has flowed and the ocean of knowledge has surged, and through Whom the Dove of Utterance has warbled upon the branch of possibility: “There is none other God but Me, the Single, the All-Wise.”</p>

God testifies that there is no God but Him, and that He Who speaks is indeed He Who declared in the eternity of eternities “Verily, I am God, the One, the Chosen.” Can those who have turned away from the Countenance distinguish between light and darkness? No, by the Lord of creation! They deny the Sun and its sovereignty, the proof and its evidence, and they say that which neither the people of the Furqan nor those who turned away from God in past ages and centuries have said. And when asked “By what proof have you turned away from God?” they say what their forefathers said before. These are indeed among the people of error. They drink putrid water while imagining it to be the water of life. They worship the calf while deluding themselves that it is the Lord of creation. Say: Shame upon you for having turned away from the Supreme Horizon, and woe unto you for having strayed from the straight path! Say: This is the Day in which the banners of the Manifestation have been raised, the Path has been laid, and the mountains have been scattered. We have seen thee turning toward Our horizon. We have sent down from Our kingdom that which will profit thee in Our realms. And verily, I am the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

Take the garment of Baha to the region of eternity that perchance the people of the divine cloud might catch its fragrance. The hosts of destiny have appeared with swords of hatred - that throat of Baha cut by their blades. Enter, O servant, beneath the glance of thy Lord. By God! Through it were opened the gates of the Paradise of the All-Merciful which were never opened in all eternity, and God created beneath the shade of one of its leaves all the gardens and what was ordained of its bounties. The clouds of tribulation have rained crimson blood - that Garment of Baha reddened by its drops.</p>

<p>O Mirza Aqa! In the Name of the Most Holy, the Most Great!</p>
<p>The world hath been illumined by the appearance of God, the Lord of all nations. Blessed is the learned one whom knowledge hath not veiled, and blessed is the wise one whom arts have not withheld, and blessed is the servant who hath cast aside what the people possess and turned toward God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Bear thou witness unto that which God Himself did testify before the creation of the heavens and earth: that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving. The days have passed and the Promised One hath come with manifest sovereignty. Among the people are those whom the attraction of the Revelation hath so seized that they have cast aside the world, turning unto God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. And among them are those whom vain imaginings have withheld from the Lord of all beings - these are indeed recorded in the Preserved Tablet as followers of idle fancy. O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One! Rejoice thou that thou hast attained the grace of thy Lord, such that the Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee and the Countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned toward thee from His glorious station. We counsel thee to be steadfast and to perform such deeds as the sincere ones find […]. Thus hath the Dove of the Cause cooed upon the branches, as a grace from God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Glory be upon thee and upon whosoever hath sought the Ultimate Goal and believed in God, the Lord of existence.</p>

I beseech Thee by the breezes of Thy Revelation and the manifestations of Thy power and the evidences of Thy sovereignty to make me in all conditions turned toward Thee and detached from Thine enemies. Verily Thou art the Almighty Whom the contingencies of the world cannot frustrate. There is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Dominant, the Almighty.”</p>

<p>O My handmaiden, daughter of My most great and most ancient uncle! The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted from the direction of the prison, and the ocean of utterance hath surged through this mighty Name. Blessed is the one who hath discovered the fragrance and turned toward it with a luminous countenance. O My handmaiden! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, from the supreme horizon. Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Draw nigh unto God through remembrance and praise, for He is indeed the Near, the Answering One. Beware lest the conditions of other women veil thee. Turn with pure vision toward the Greatest Scene and say: “Praise be unto Thee for having made Thyself known unto me, and for having strengthened me to remember Thee, and for having mentioned me by the tongue of Thy grandeur in this mighty Tablet.” We had sent down a Tablet unto thee aforetime as a token of Our grace upon thee. He is verily the Mighty, the Bountiful. Drink thou the choice wine of life from the Kawthar of thy Lord’s utterance, the All-Merciful. Thus doth command thee the Lord of all worlds. We hear those who make mention of their Lord, and We behold those who have turned toward Him on this wondrous Day. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee. Nothing in the kingdom can equal it, as doth testify He with Whom is the knowledge of all things in a clear Book.

<p>This is a Book sent down by the Wronged One on a day when he who denied God, the All-Possessing, the Self-Subsisting, rose up against Him. Verily, he who sucketh from the breast of the world hath turned away from God, the Lord of Names, and waged war in such wise as none can reckon save the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Say: The Governor of Akka hath pronounced judgment upon God, the Creator of the heavens. We sustained him, then seized him suddenly. He, verily, is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Possessing over what was and what shall be. He was named Abdul-Rahman among the people of creation, yet verily he was the manifestation of Satan. To this beareth witness this Pen whereby the Preserved Tablet hath been adorned. In his final days he committed that which caused the Concourse on High to lament, and those who circle round the Throne to weep. Say: Thou canst not prevent God from exercising His sovereignty, even as those greater than thee were powerless to do so. He, verily, is the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Thou didst desire one thing, but We desired another. The will and purpose of God prevailed, yet most of the people perceive not. We took several persons in this city - some We banished, some We afflicted with illness, and some We seized through Our power in such wise that none discovered the cause thereof. He, verily, is the Ruler over whatsoever He pleaseth through His word “Be” and it is. Thus have We recounted unto thee what befell Us on this day as a bounty from Our presence, that thou mayest be of them that render thanks. Turn not unto the world and its conditions. Remember in all circumstances this wronged Exile Who hath accepted tribulations in the path of God, the Lord of Names, and Who speaketh that which He hath been bidden by God, the Mighty, the All-Loving.</p>

But when the morn of Revelation breathed forth and the horizon of the world was illumined by the Sun of His Most Great Name, they denied and turned away, save whom the Mighty, the Bestower, wished. By God’s life!

Enable me to remember Thee in Thy days and praise Thee among Thy handmaidens. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast raised the standards of Thy Cause among Thy servants and hoisted the banners of Thy sovereignty amidst Thy creation, that Thou shut me not out from the door of Thy grace and withhold not from me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy handmaidens who have turned with their whole being to the court of Thy bounty and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation.

The seeing one is he who hath beheld the proof of his Lord, and the knowing one is he who hath recognized his Bountiful Lord, and the speaking one is he who hath uttered His praise, and the hearing one is he who hath hearkened unto the call of God, the Lord of the worlds. He who hath been heedless in the days of God is assuredly among the losers. O servants of God! Arise to serve the Cause, then assist it through that which ye have been commanded in the Tablets, and be not of them that sit still. Ye were created for this Day which hath been mentioned in the Scriptures of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Vie ye with each other in good deeds. Thus doth He Who revealeth the verses command you, if ye be of them who understand. When thou attainest unto a Tablet of thy Lord, read what is therein with the most melodious voice. It will attract thee to an exalted station. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.</p>

Know thou that We have made this Book a remembrance for you that ye may remember Me after Me and be of them that remember. Thus do We impart unto thee that which descendeth upon thy heart - verses of mighty glory - that thou mayest thank God, thy Creator, in these days the like of which the eyes of them of old have never witnessed. Beware lest thou forget God’s favor unto thee and be of the heedless ones. Then remember on Our behalf thy wife and those who were in thy house, and give them glad tidings of the shore of a mighty Name. Then thy brother and those who have believed in God and held fast unto the handle of holy exaltation. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon him who hath been patient in God and was, in love, among the firmly rooted ones.</p>

<p>Urmia. O servant who hath attained unto the Most Holy and Most Glorious Presence! This is a Book sent down in truth unto people who understand. Verily there is no God but Him, and all shall return unto Him. We have ordained good things for those who, through fear of their Lord, are filled with apprehension. Say: This indeed is the Truth - will ye then turn back upon your heels? By God! That which was promised unto you hath appeared in truth, yet ye deny it. This indeed is the All-Merciful Who hath come with clear proof, yet most of you detest the truth. Soon shall We seize those who have cast the Command of God behind their backs, and when the breezes of the verses reach them, then do they cry out in anguish. Say: The mercy hath come, yet from it ye flee. Say: Within Our grasp are the destinies of all things, and with Us is a Book that speaketh of what your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath willed, would ye but understand. Say: O people! Leave those who have disbelieved to wallow in their folly, and hold fast unto the cord of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. O My servant! Hear My counsel, then detach thyself from all else besides Me. By My life! All that thou seest in My earth shall perish, and the Cause shall remain with My Self. Blessed is he who hath turned unto God and turned away from those who deny. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who act according to My command.</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down from before the Throne to him who hath believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, and who hath perceived the fragrance of the All-Merciful from the garment of Our Most Great Name, whereby all that was and will be hath arisen, surging like the sea in remembrance of God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people! This is the Day wherein the heaven hath been cleft asunder, and the earth hath been rent, and the skin hath crept with fear, save of him who hath answered his Lord and turned toward this outstretched Shadow. Be thou a lamp of the remembrance of thy Lord amongst His servants, that through thee may be illumined the faces of those whom the veils have not withheld from the remembrance of their Lord, the Munificent, the All-Bestowing. Thus hath the Command come, but the people understand not. Soon shall the sincere ones find the signs of their Lord’s victory, the All-Merciful, and by them shall those who associate partners with God be shaken. Say: Verily in this Prison are signs for the people of Baha and clear proofs for those who fear God. Arise at thy Lord’s command, the All-Merciful, and remind the people of this Name whereby the Herald hath called out in the midst of the heavens: “Your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, hath come!” And glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and who in His love have detached themselves from all that is seen and unseen.</p>

Sanctify your souls and your bodies that ye may be raised up to the plane of a glorious Name. Know then, O servant, that We have not failed in Our promise, but the idolaters have opposed and disobeyed their Lord’s command, eagerly persisting in their wrongdoing. Were it not for their oppression, We would surely have fulfilled Our promise and remained steadfast to Our Covenant. For this reason have We withheld it from you and most of the people, who have not heard, and the matter was ordained. Grieve not over anything, but be patient within thyself and put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and be not sorrowful in the kingdom. Strive within thyself that thy countenance may not turn away from love, though every grievous torment be inflicted upon thee.

And among them is he who, having heard the verses of God, waxeth proud against them and is numbered with the idolaters. Place thy trust in God in thy affairs, then remain steadfast in such wise that the veils of them that have disbelieved in thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great, shall not hinder thee.

Blessed are they that have turned towards Him.</p>
<p>O Most Exalted Pen! Make mention of those handmaidens who have believed in God on a Day wherein men were prevented from turning to God, the Most High, the Most Great. How many were the servants who traveled throughout the lands for My remembrance and visited the spots associated with the Names for My good-pleasure. Yet when I revealed Myself, they turned away and disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Blessed are ye, O handmaids of God, for having turned towards the Kaaba of existence and for having been wafted upon by the fragrances of the Robe from this luminous Quarter. Be ye steadfast in the love of God and His Cause, then make mention of that which hath been sent down in the Tablets from the presence of One mighty and wise. Gather ye together and make mention with joy and radiance, despite those who have adorned their heads with turbans as a display of learning, yet when the Known One appeared, recognized Him not.

<p>O My handmaiden! The Ancient Beauty hath called thee from the Most Great Prison and addressed thee by this blessed name, which hath no equal. This word “O My handmaiden” is more excellent and ancient than the crowns of all the queens of the world; nay, all have been and shall ever be as nothing and non-existent when compared with its mention. Know thou the station of this most great bounty and preserve it as the apple of thine eye. How many were the divines, mystics, princes and queens of the earth who, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, besought the All-Possessing Lord for the attainment of this blessed Day. Yet when the lights of the Day of God shone forth from the horizon of the Divine Will, all were found to be veiled. But thou hast attained unto it, to such an extent that He hath mentioned thee in the Most Great Prison at a time when sorrows had encompassed the Ancient Beauty. Exalted is this supreme bounty! Exalted is this noble station! Were the true station of this bounty to be described as it truly is, all the books of the world and the pens of all nations would not suffice nor prove equal to the task. The glory be upon thee and upon My handmaidens in that land.</p>

Today belongeth unto the Truth, for the Speaker of the Mount is seated upon the throne of Manifestation and the call of the Lord of Names is raised from the horizon of ’Akka before the faces of the divines and princes. The tribulations of the world did not prevent Him, nor did the clamor of enemies hold Him back from uttering the Word. O My leaf! He who loved Me and soared in the atmosphere of My love hath mentioned thee. We make mention of thee in this perspicuous Tablet. The divines and learned ones of the earth departed this ephemeral world yearning for the blessed word “O My servant”, while thou in His days hast attained unto the blessed word “O My handmaiden”. Know thou the worth of this exalted word and preserve it in the treasury of thy heart in the name of the Beloved of the worlds. Say: My God, my God! Thou seest Thy handmaiden who hath turned unto Thee and directed herself toward the horizon of Thy Manifestation. I beseech Thee not to disappoint her of that which Thou hast ordained for Thy handmaidens who circle round Thy most great throne at morn and eventide. Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.

We have heard thy mention and have mentioned thee with that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the realm of names endure, yet most of the people are heedless. Blessed is every handmaiden who has heard and turned and responded to her Ancient Lord. Woe to every servant whom vainglory has kept back from the Lord of the Manifestation until he denied God, the Lord of all worlds. O my handmaiden! Rejoice in My mention, for it is better for thee than every deed and every wise command. Beware lest the veils of women hold thee back from the Lord of Names, or the deeds of the idolaters frighten thee from this clear announcement. By God’s life! My mention of thee is greater in God’s sight than the creation of the heavens and earth. Soon shall come a day wherein God will manifest what He has willed as a bounty from His presence, and He is the Almighty, the Powerful. And We mention My handmaidens in that place and give them glad tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which has preceded every mighty matter. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

We have heard your call and have answered you, and We have seen your devotion and have turned toward you from this Station and revealed for you this Tablet that you may read it and remember your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. This is the Day wherein it behooveth every soul to arise to serve his Lord. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. The loved ones of the Beloved must today be engaged in divine remembrance with utmost love and unity. I swear by the Sun of Grandeur that the soul was created for this Day, and hearing, sight, heart, tongue and ears were brought into being to hearken unto His verses, recognize the Dawning-Place thereof and mention Him. Strive that perchance thou mayest attain unto the most great steadfastness and summon the people unto it. Although We have forbidden the people in all divine Books from clinging to names in the Day of Manifestation, yet it is observed that some have clung to certain names and have remained heedless of and turned away from the Lord and Creator of Names. Blessed art thou for having attained unto this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the sun of thy Lord’s tender mercy, the Generous One.</p>

<p>O ’Abdu’l-Hamid! Upon thee be the Glory of God and His loving-kindness. Rejoice within thyself and give thyself the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness, the Lord of all worlds. Verily the Most Great Ocean desired to send thee from the shells of His bounty the pearls of loving-kindness and favors. By the life of God! No mention or utterance can equal this Word. Verily it is as the sun among all mentions, to which My Manifest Book beareth witness. Thy letter hath come before the Wronged One. We found from it the fragrance of thy love for God, the Goal of them that know, and every word thereof testified to thy clinging to the hem of the robe of thy Lord’s mercy, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. We beseech God to make thee a standard of His Name amongst His servants, and through thee to draw people nigh unto Him and guide them to His straight path. We sent thee aforetime that which remindeth the servants of the signs of God, the King, the True One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be thou speaking with an utterance whereby the tongues of the world will speak, and arise to serve the Cause with such arising whereby every doubting sitter will arise. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon thee and upon them that are with thee and upon My loved ones there who have cast aside all else save Me and have held fast unto My strong and mighty cord.</p>

Reflect upon Abu-Basir and Ashraf and that which was manifested from them. I swear by the ocean of divine knowledge that the Concourse on High were struck with wonder at their martyrdom. Blessed are they both, and blessed is he who visiteth them, who seeketh them out, who turneth toward them, who maketh mention of them, and who draweth nigh through them unto God, the Forgiving, the Generous. With illumined hearts and radiant faces did they ascend. The rustling of the Divine Lote Tree so attracted them that they beheld the world and all therein as utter nothingness and attained unto the presence of Him Who ever is. Verily, We make mention of the physician and those who were martyred in My path in that place, with a remembrance whose fragrance shall endure as long as the kingdom of earth and heaven endureth. Thus hath the matter been decreed from before God, the Forgiving, the Generous. Blessed is he who remembereth them and prayeth for them in manifest humility.

<p>O handmaid of God Zahra, wife of a brother!</p>
<p>In the name of the One Friend! This is a Day wherein all things are delighting and rejoicing in the fragrant breezes of the utterance of the Lord of Names, and all creation is drawn in rapture and ecstasy to this spiritual breeze. Blessed is the state of the one who has become illumined by the lights of this most mighty, most holy Day and who has attained to the outpouring bounties from the heaven of generosity. Strive, make a mighty effort, that perchance you may discover the fragrance of the merciful garment in these days and find your way to the eternal city, and not be among those souls who are occupied with the mention of the Beloved while remaining veiled from Him. Many were the servants and handmaidens who in the nights and days would remember the Friend and yearn for His presence, yet when the veil was lifted remained veiled from Him and turned to other than Him. We beseech God not to deprive that handmaiden from the ocean of His bounty and to count her among those handmaidens who have turned their faces to the All-Merciful in the days of His manifestation. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

Today the denizens of the Supreme Concourse and the exalted Paradise consort with one another in utmost joy and gladness, delight and expansion, giving one another the glad-tidings of attainment to His presence. For the holy and luminous spirits have ascended from the earth, and all have welcomed them. And now, in perfect fellowship and unity, they walk in that holy and blessed land and those luminous and spiritual realms. And the dwellers of the pavilion of glory each utter this most blessed and exalted word: “The day of joy has come! The loved ones in the divine garden, with spiritual souls, are engaged in eternal pleasure and everlasting delight!” And the inhabitants of the canopy of grace each proclaim this exalted word: “This is the day wherein the sincere ones and those brought nigh have attained the presence of those who gave up their spirits in the path of God, the Lord of all worlds and the Sovereign of the mighty throne!” O thou who hast turned unto God! Give thanks unto God, exalted be He, for having aided thee and sent down for thee in this Tablet that which hath attracted the realities of existence, both hidden and manifest. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon every patient and grateful one.</p>

<p>O Mirza Buzurg, upon him be the Glory of God! Today the entire world is illumined by the effulgences of the lights of the Revelation, yet most of its people remain heedless. The people of the earth are all withered, nay rather dead. They must be quickened through the water of wisdom and utterance and the life-giving Kawthar. Blessed is the soul that hath attained thereunto, blessed the eye that hath witnessed, and blessed the ear that hath heard. The hearkening to a single call is better in the sight of God than the deeds of all who are on earth. A hundred thousand regrets that they are deprived of this endless bounty and veiled from this infinite grace. Be not grieved by what hath befallen. Every soul is occupied according to his station. They have cast the station of God behind their backs and followed every heedless and remote one. Soon shall they find themselves in manifest loss. Rejoice thou in My remembrance of thee and give glad-tidings to My loved ones of My tender mercy and My grace which have preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Thus have We illumined the horizon of the heaven of proof with the luminary of utterance. Blessed be the mystic who hath attained and risen to serve the Cause, and woe unto them that are abased.</p>

Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen taught thee and moved upon thy name on this dark night, that thou mayest be of those who give thanks. Grieve not over anything and trust in God in all matters. He exalteth whom He willeth and abaseth whom He willeth. All things lie within the grasp of His might. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. And glory be upon thee and upon those who, when they heard their Lord’s call, responded: “Yea, verily we are all worshippers.”</p>

Hear My call from the heaven of My loving-kindness and from the right hand of the throne of My grandeur - that I am the One grief-stricken by My servants and saddened by what hath befallen My Beauty at the hands of the manifestations of My wrath. Therefore, ascend with thy heart unto the kingdom of My nearness, and soar with thy spirit in the atmosphere of My grace and favor, that thou mayest hear My melodies and become aware of what Mine enemies have brought down upon My Beauty. O My servant! Cut thyself from the paths of heedlessness, then walk in the ways of My grace and My favors that thou mayest attain unto the Ridvan of My love and the garden of My affection and My grandeur. By God, the True One! Verily My fragrances guide the longing ones unto the gardens of My mercy, and the radiance of My countenance leadeth those who desire Me unto the seat of My throne and My power, and then unto the Kawthar of My grace and My gifts. Thus hath the breeze of wisdom wafted from the direction of My finger upon My loved ones, that they may become aware of My Self - the Wronged One, the Stranger, the Prisoner, the Lonely One, the Sorrowful, the Slain One. And the Glory be upon thee, O servant, from thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. There is no God but Him, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Merciful, the Possessor of Grace and Bounty.</p>

Drink thou from the water of life, then give to drink them that dwell in the realm of possibility, that it may draw them nigh unto the Mighty, the Best-Beloved.

And We commanded them not to cling to anything at the time of the Manifestation, nor to hold fast to the hem of the Bayan and whatsoever commands and ordinances are therein.

Know thou the value of these days, and preserve like unto the sight of thine eye these exalted words which have been sent from the Most Great Scene. And say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who art wronged by the peoples of the world! Thus doth the tongue speak forth in this noble station. Glory be unto those who have cast behind their backs the idle fancies of the people and have taken that which they were bidden by an All-Powerful, Ancient Lord.</p>

<p>O friends! Today is the day when each of the loved ones must arise to render assistance to the All-Merciful, inasmuch as most of those on earth have striven to extinguish the fire of God and His light. He Who hath come for the life of the peoples of the world and the salvation of all nations hath, with utmost tyranny and injustice, been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities. I swear by the Dawning-Place of the Most Great Name that all tribulations and afflictions have not and will never prevent this Servant from the remembrance of God. All the friends of Truth must exert their utmost endeavor that perchance a soul may attain unto the Salsabil of inner meanings. This deed is accounted as the most great of all deeds in the sight of God. Blessed are they who have detached themselves from all else save God in His path and who have, purely for His sake, arisen to scatter the divine utterances throughout all regions, that they might find one who is ready and call him to the eternal city. These souls are recorded in the sight of God as among His goodly names. Blessed are they and those who have followed the Truth.</p>

<p>O friends! Today I give glad-tidings to the people of the world. That which was hidden has been made manifest. The straight path has appeared, the balance is visible. The mountains, plains and rivers give glad-tidings to each other of the appearance of the Hidden Name and the Treasured Mystery. Stand firm in the Cause of God with such steadfastness that it will cause the steadfastness of all the peoples of the world. For years, mighty efforts were expended to exalt the Word and proclaim the Cause. Now it is observed that excellent souls have arisen against the Lord of Names merely for… and have set about to waste the Cause of God. Beseech God that He may guide them and prevent them from this great injustice. He is the Powerful, He is the Mighty, He is the All-Knowing, He is the All-Wise. Thou hast been mentioned before the Wronged One and this most holy, most exalted Tablet hath been revealed that the joy of the utterance of the All-Merciful may take thee and make thee among those who are nigh. In all conditions hold fast to the cord of grace and cling to the greatest steadfastness, for thieves lie in wait in the thicket of negligence. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto this mighty, this most holy Cause.</p>

<p>My brother Muhammad who has emigrated to God. In the name of the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing! O friends! God willing, may you be blessed with the grace of the All-Merciful and dwell with perfect assurance beneath the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree. Reflect upon the chosen ones of God and what they have endured at the hands of enemies in times past and times more distant still. God, exalted be His glory, has ever summoned creation to that which profits them, yet the unjust people have arisen in utmost oppression, inflicting whatever tyranny and aggression lay within their power. They who are endowed with vision and gaze upon the Most Great Horizon behold the entire world and all that transpires therein as non-existence. That which is attributed to God, glorified and exalted be He, has been and ever shall be enduring and eternal. Rejoice then in what has befallen thee in the path of God and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having enabled me to bear tribulations in Thy love and good-pleasure. Verily Thou art the Almighty over whatsoever Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.”</p>

<p>This is a Book sent down in truth from God, the King, the True, the Manifest. Verily it is a revelation from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Associate not partners with God; worship but one God, Single, Peerless, Alone, the Self-Subsisting, by Whose will was revealed that which lay hidden in the breasts of the idolaters. Say: O people! By what proof have ye disbelieved in God, the Beloved of the worlds? And by what evidence did ye believe in a previous Manifestation while turning away from Him Who is the Beloved of His Essence and the Purpose of His mystery, O company of the veiled! Say: All things were promised to attain His presence in the Year Nine. Read ye the Bayan that ye may find a way unto Him. O people! He hath appeared with the proofs of the ancients and the Scriptures of those who came after. Were it not for Him, the Dove would not have warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Eternity, nor would the breezes of bounty have wafted over all creation. Fear ye God, then be ashamed before His Beauty, and be not of those who turn aside. If ye believe not, oppose Him not. Leave Him to Himself; the nations of the earth suffice Him, and then the kings and rulers. Say: O people of the Bayan! The Beloved of all possibility hath informed of your tyranny in that which was sent down from the heaven of mighty and exalted glory. He spoke, and His word is the truth: “O people of the Bayan! After My testament I see you wrapped in a mighty veil. I revealed not the Bayan except for His Self and His remembrance, and My purpose in what I revealed was naught but His radiant and luminous Beauty. Yet ye do unto Him what neither the Jews did unto the Spirit (Christ), nor the people of the Furqan (Muslims) unto My Self, nor Nimrod unto God, the Mighty, the Wise.” God, the Most High, the Most Great, hath spoken truly, and that which He foretold hath come to pass. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth. Say: Fie upon you, O heedless ones! By God! Through your cruelty the hearts of the discerning have been shaken, the veil of concealment rent asunder, and the Lord of Lords hath lamented upon His mighty throne. His Beloved now waileth and weepeth, saying: “O people! Have mercy upon Him Who sat beneath the swords of the deniers, against Whom the followers of all religions have risen, conspiring at every moment to slay Him. If ye believed in the Exalted One (the Bab), why do ye wage war against His Beloved with the swords of rejection? If ye show no mercy to Him, then have mercy upon yourselves and be not of the wrongdoers.” Soon shall the angels of chastisement come unto you, and ye shall behold with your own eyes that which ye neglected, and ye shall say: “Would that we had never been born, never been suckled, and never denied Him of Whom we were promised in the Tablets of God, the King, the Mighty, the Generous!” Thus have We related unto thee from the tales of the Youth, that thou mayest stand firm in His aid, even though We find thee in mighty doubt. Hearken unto My call, then rend asunder the veils of idle fancy through the power of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Part the veils of glory that thou mayest behold the Sun of thy Lord’s Beauty rising from the horizon of grandeur with manifest radiance. Shatter the idols of vain imaginings and turn toward the right hand of certainty. Verily, he who whispereth in the breasts of those who believe is in mighty error and hath never comprehended this Cause, and thy Lord is witness to what I say. Say: O people! Your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath not made this Manifestation dependent upon anything in creation, were ye but to know. He foretold that the chiefs of the Bayan would oppose the Beloved of the worlds, and despite your knowledge of this, ye committed what ye committed. Had this Manifestation been dependent upon anything, ye would not have done what ye did, O ye at whose deeds the angels of the near ones are bewildered! Verily, thou hearest My word; shun those who have disbelieved and turned away, and turn unto God with a sound heart. By God! The acceptance of anyone profiteth Me not this day. Verily, My Lord is All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Turn to God with a truthful heart. By God, the recognition of anyone profits Me not this day. Verily My Lord is All-Knowing, All-Informed. We call solely for the sake of God, lest anyone should say “Had I known, I would have followed the straight path.” Thus hath counseled the Most Exalted Pen. Whoso heareth, it is for his own sake, and whoso turneth away, it is to his own loss. Verily God is Self-Sufficient, All-Praised. Blessed is he who hath broken the chains of imitation with the strength of unity and turned to God, purified from the allusions of the arrogant ones. And glory be upon those who have been quickened by the breezes of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and have been turned from the left hand of fancy to the right hand of certitude. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Hearken to the call of this Prisoner, He Whose deeds bear witness to Him, and Whose truth is attested by all atoms. Purify and sanctify thy heart from all save Him and from all that thou hast heard. Consider the Kitab-i-Badi’ which was written in answer to the objections of the deniers, and likewise the Books of the Bayan and that which was revealed concerning the Names, that the purpose of the revelation of the Book of Names may become evident, and that ye may become aware of the sublimity of God’s Cause and the exaltation of the Pen of the All-Merciful. Give especial consideration to the Persian Bayan, particularly the eighth chapter of the sixth Vahid, that ye may be convinced that today there is no refuge for anyone except entrance into the shore of the Most Great Ocean. Observe how even caution in this Cause hath been deemed as polytheism and reckoned among the deeds of the people of the fire, though caution in all matters hath been beloved. Since they were aware of the subsequent Manifestation and the opposition of the leaders of the Bayan, they removed even caution and forbade it. Hath any previous Manifestation given such emphatic statements and explicit declarations regarding the subsequent Revelation? Nay, by His very Self, the True One! This was naught but the knowledge of that Source of Knowledge concerning the subsequent Manifestation. Throughout the Bayan it was revealed not to fix your gaze upon the Letters and Mirrors. It is evident that the Letters and Mirrors exist during the days of the Manifestation, and after the ascension of the Primal Will they become concealed. The designation of Letters and Mirrors will never again apply to anyone. Reflect deeply upon this utterance that ye may drink from the incomparable pure water of exposition and become intoxicated with the Kawthar of “Am I not?” Then emerge from behind the veils of allusions through the power of the Lord of Names and Attributes, and become steadfast in the Cause of God. Today is a Day wherein whatever man forsaketh cannot be retrieved. Throughout the Bayan, this Manifestation was not made conditional upon the permission or acceptance of any soul or any matter whatsoever. Yet there occurred what occurred. Had it been made conditional, what would have transpired? That divine Tree spoke naught except utter effacement in the subsequent Manifestation. Look in the Bayan that thou mayest find a way unto Him. Specifically, the honored Siyyah is now present, and he is the one concerning whom the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - said: “We have made thee a king to proclaim between the hands of the Qa’im.” His epistle is well-known, and resurrection and gathering were revealed in that blessed Tablet. Likewise, in other Tablets, descriptions beyond reckoning concerning his attributes were revealed from the Supreme Pen. In these days he wrote some pages to Siyyid Muhammad, counseling him, and at the end mentioned that although “I know that personal motives have caused thee to turn away from the Truth, as I have associated with thee before and know thee,” and after mentioning investigations he had heard about the irreligiosity of the aforementioned Siyyid, he wrote that in his last journey when he attained the presence of His Holiness the Most Exalted Lord - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him - He gave him the glad tidings of the Most Great Manifestation.</p>
<p>During my final journey, when I attained the presence of His Holiness the Exalted Lord - may our spirits be sacrificed for Him - He gave me the glad tidings of the Most Great Manifestation. This was at a time when all the Letters and Mirrors were known and the creation of Names was complete. After hearing these greatest glad tidings from the lips of the All-Merciful, I became so attracted and enkindled that it defies description. Turning to God, I traveled to every land that perchance I might gain knowledge of that Most Great Luminary and attain His presence. And now, after this Most Great Manifestation, thou hast done what thou hast done. Similarly, they wrote to the honored Azim to search that he might find and attain unto the Most Great Luminary. Likewise, they gave glad tidings to certain Letters that they would attain the presence of God, as all that was revealed is recorded and preserved in the Books. And they say that if they did not appear, it is evident that the Truth did not wish to make Himself known.</p>
<p>Hearken unto the Voice of the Pen of the All-Merciful, by His Own Self, the All-Bountiful, of which none hath been or is aware. Should anyone gaze with the eye of God upon His words, he would surely realize the nature of this Cause. Would that thou hadst been present before Us and heard what none among all creation hath heard! When thou didst see him whose name equateth with the number of Nabil and who was present there, say: Be fair, by God, and utter not that which causeth all that was revealed in the Bayan to lament. Thou hast not seen Him Whom thou hast taken as thy Lord and to Whom thou callest others, nor art thou aware of Him or His deeds. Fear God and be of the God-fearing. At least act according to what the Point of the Bayan hath ordained, for after countless counsels He saith that if ye believe not, at least oppose not. I marvel greatly at you, for though you have seen Siyyid Muhammad and are aware of his deeds and beliefs, yet there hath appeared from you that which was unseemly. I pour out my grief and sorrow unto God. Now that you fix not your gaze upon the truth and what appeareth from His presence, and have secluded yourself in vain imaginings, at least consider the Persian Bayan that perchance thou mayest recognize and arise and proclaim among the servants that which thy Lord, the Lord of creation, hath commanded thee on the Day when the pavilion of justice was raised and the carpet of grace was spread. Although He saith that none can know that Most Great Luminary unless he beholdeth Him with His own eye, by God, O Muhammad, I speak not from desire, and whenever I am silent the Spirit speaketh within my breast, but the people hear not. Thinkest thou that I desire Myself? Nay, by the Self of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting! Or the world? Nay, by thy Lord, the Most Exalted! Rend asunder the veils with the arm of certitude, then turn toward God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Loving. And now they have attributed worldliness and written thus to various regions, though by God, besides Whom there is none other God, outward difficulty beyond measure is evident. If you would reflect a little upon those matters they have attributed, you would distinguish truth from falsehood. Consider not that today a few have become certain of this Cause and have turned toward the sanctuary of holiness. Soon you shall see the banners of polytheism and hypocrisy lowered from all directions, for my Beloved hath informed: “Unless God should will otherwise, and He verily hath power over whatsoever He willeth. None hath any authority except after His leave. He manifesteth whatsoever He willeth, and He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing.” In brief, compare not this Cause with what was before or shall come after, and be not veiled from its Creator by names. Soon shall the world and whatsoever existeth therein pass away, and the Cause shall remain for the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And peace be upon him who followeth guidance. We have protected thee in many situations, some of which thou rememberest and some thou hast forgotten, and thy Lord knoweth thee better than thou knowest thyself, and with Him is the knowledge of what was and what shall be. Hear My words, rend asunder the veils, then turn thy face toward thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower, and say […]</p>
<p>O Lord! I have come to Thee, detached from all save Thee, turning unto the sanctuary of Thy nearness and Thy good-pleasure. I acknowledge Thy unity and confess Thy singleness, submitting to Thy Manifestation which Thou didst promise me in the Books of Thy decree and the Tablets of Thy destiny. O Lord! Make me not of those who act according to what hath been sent down from Thy Most Exalted Pen, yet deny their Lord, the Most High. O Lord! Purify me from the whisperings of those who instill doubts in the hearts of Thy creatures, after Thou hast come with the evidences of Thy sovereignty, the signs of Thy power, the tokens of Thy grandeur, the proofs of Thy lordship, and the attributes of Thy divinity. O Lord! Deprive me not of what lieth with Thee, nor bar me from the stream which floweth from the right hand of the throne of Thy oneness. Have mercy upon me, O my God, through Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things and through Thy grace which hath encompassed all existence, that I may behold Thee with Thine eye and know Thee through Thine own Self. And if Thou grantest me not this, then enable me to behold Thee with mine own eye, not with the eyes that are clouded by the dust of idle fancies and thereby prevented from witnessing the lights of Thy countenance and beholding the manifestations of Thy glorious oneness. Verily, Thou art the One Who hath power over Thy command and art exalted through Thy might. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Rida! The metaphorical world and the visible world are both sheer nothingness, though they appear in the garment of existence. The first is the highwayman of the wayfarers, and the second is the trial of those who have arrived. Therefore, mighty effort is needed so that the divine spirit may pass beyond these two ego-centered obstacles through heavenly power and dwell in the hiding place of peerless reunion. I swear by God that a moment’s peace in these days beneath the shade of the Tree of this most great Manifestation is greater than the creation of the heavens and earth. Just as this Revelation and its tokens of affirmation are the most mighty of manifestations, likewise the letters of negation in these days are mightier than all past and future ages, and are more firm and steadfast in their opposition. Thus have We ordained the matter in a preserved tablet. The meaning of the world of causes is the heedlessness of the servant from the One Who is served, and this has not had and does not have specification to any particular thing. Therefore, strive mightily that today the veils of glory may not prevent thee from the Throne of revelation and independence.

Therefore, whosoever attains to this station, be they women or men, must manifest such qualities and character that the fragrance of holiness may be inhaled therefrom.

Concerning what thou didst write about certain friends having asked various questions about backbiting and other matters - these subjects are clear as the sun in the divine Tablets. In these days all must be enkindled with the fire of the Word and occupied with service to the Cause. They should regard time as precious and enlighten the people of the world with wisdom and utterance. Whosoever today succeeds in acknowledging that which God hath revealed in the Book is accounted among the denizens of the most exalted Paradise. This is the lord of all days, and the King of Manifestations is seated upon the throne of utterance. Blessed are they who attain! The days of the Divine Manifestations are in one sense referred to as the Day of God, but these days are specially distinguished in all the Books as the appearance of the Hidden Mystery and the Treasured Secret, Who calleth out with the most exalted voice before the faces of all the world. The greatness of these days hath been recorded and inscribed in the previous Books and in the mighty Qur’an. The Herald, that is, the Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - in the days of His journey to Maku, while outwardly veiled from all, attained the honor of His presence, and His Holiness Quddus - upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory - attained repeatedly. During the journey to the Land of Kha He specifically summoned him, and for several months he was blessed with attaining His presence. The Primal Point - may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for His sake - referred to both him and His Holiness the Most Great Bab - upon him be the Most Glorious of all Glory - as the First and the Last, and likewise interpreted them as the First to arrive and the Last to descend. He gave each the glad tidings of this Manifestation, and specifically told the honored Siyyah - upon him be the glory and favor of God - “Go forth, that thou mayest find.” The universal Manifestations were aware before the Revelation - they are the Dawning-places of divine knowledge. The servant beseecheth his Lord to assist His loved ones to recognize what He hath revealed in His perspicuous Book.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart! Some remembrances become the cause of veiling, and likewise cause the extinguishing of the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree in one’s being. Glory be upon him who limiteth his gaze to turning toward the Most Sublime Horizon, detached from all idle fancies and vain imaginings. In truth, some remembrances become the cause of heedlessness and lassitude, especially remembrances with which God is not pleased. It is hoped that all may drink from the choice wine of the Merciful’s utterance and appear adorned with the ornament of distinction in the assemblage of the world. Verily the people of God must be distinguished from all others. Greetings, glorification, remembrance and splendor from beginning to end have been and are conveyed to the loved ones of that land, and this evanescent servant beseecheth the Eternal Truth to assist all in that which is befitting.</p>
<p>Regarding what thou didst write about movement toward and orientation to the city of Ishqabad, after presentation before His presence - glorified be His majesty - He said: “It would be well if they did not remain too long in the land of Ta, for prolonged stay will surely cause certain matters to be revealed by some to others, and in that land also certain two-faced persons are observed. In any case, travel is sometimes counted among the requirements of wisdom.” End.</p>
<p>Another petition: Last year, one of the officials sent a petition to the Most Holy Court through the beloved Nazir, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. A response was revealed, but his name was not written. If deemed advisable, that beloved one may write the name and give it, otherwise to another person.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about honoring the Sacred Writings, whatever is beloved should be written. One must act in such a way that the Tablets remain in their original delicacy. They should be placed on separate sheets, read, and then preserved in a special place.</p>
<p>Another matter: Some Tablets were sent as commanded in this servant’s handwriting. Likewise, some Tablets were both inscribed in the original letter and sent as separate Tablets. The page of remembrances was written and sent as commanded in the handwriting of the honored beloved Mishkin-Qalam, upon him be Baha’u’llah’s glory. Since in these days they have severed relations with Cyprus and have come with their families to the Most Holy Court with no intention of return, the prison land, as the Arabs say, is full - neither house nor inn remains. The command belongs to God, the Powerful, the Bestower.</p>
<p>Regarding what was written about the medicine formula, such a thing has not existed in this land. It is not known from where this report has originated. The blessed Tablet revealed in response to the spiritual beloved Aqa Mirza Jalil, upon him be [Baha’u’llah’s glory], was not sent this time due to the size of the envelope. It will be sent next time, God willing. Give that beloved one this glad-tiding.</p>

O My people! How many were the servants and handmaidens who awaited this blessed Day and quaffed the cups of joy and gladness in remembrance thereof. Yet when the morning of the Promised Day dawned from the horizon of the world, all were found heedless save those souls who, through the name of their Friend, had purified themselves from the defilements of the world and its conditions, and attained unto the station of unveiling and witnessing and the presence of God. Hold fast unto the cord of My love, then detach thyself from the worlds. Fix thy gaze upon Him, remain steadfast in His love, and be occupied with His remembrance. He is the companion of purified hearts. All must preserve His abode and dwelling place in His name from thieves and betrayers and from doubts and imaginings.

Ye have won the prize of victory, and were this station to be unveiled, perchance some would perish from joy. At all times occupy yourselves with praise and thanksgiving and glorification of God, and hold fast unto His cord.

Verily Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Generous. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

Glorified be His greatness and exalted be His dominion! O Asad! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the One, the Self-Subsisting! Thy name was mentioned before the Wronged One.

Say: My God, my God, my Lord and my Support! I testify that through Thee the names of divine knowledge have been adorned with the stars of utterance and the ocean of generosity hath surged before the faces of the nations. I beseech Thee by Thy mysteries that lie concealed within Thy Book and by the splendors of the Day-Star of Thy bounty to ordain for me and for Thy loved ones that which will draw us nigh unto Thee and cause us to speak Thy praise. O Lord! Thou art the All-Bountiful, the Lord of great bounty. Aid us to make up for what hath escaped us in Thy days.

<p>O Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, Creator of the heavens! Thou wert mentioned before the Throne, and We revealed for thee aforetime that which caused all things to soar with longing to hearken unto the call of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Rejoice in My turning toward thee from the prison, and illumine hearts with the light of thy Lord’s knowledge, and remind them of the verses of the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen. There has come before the Wronged One thy letter which thou didst send to the servant in attendance, and it was presented before His face. We have answered thee with verses whose fragrance has spread through the cities of knowledge and wisdom. Verily thy Lord is He Who has dominion over what has been and what will be.</p>
<p>O Rida! Convey My greetings to the loved ones on behalf of the Wronged One. Each one has attained and continues to attain to My remembrance.</p>
<p>The call of Eliyahu has attained to hearing. We beseech God to confirm him in steadfastness and to grant him success in that which causes the exaltation of His Word and the advancement of souls. He may say:</p>
<p>“My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy power which has conquered all created things, and by Thy might which has encompassed all existence, to assist me in that which Thou lovest and art pleased with, and to enable me to perform good deeds and display praiseworthy character. O Lord! Thou seest the seeker standing before the door of Thy grace - deprive him not of the wonders of Thy bounty and generosity. Ordain for him the good of this world and the next. Verily Thou art the Most Exalted, the Most High.”</p>

We bear witness that thou hast attained to Our mention, and through thy name there have appeared from the treasuries of My Most Exalted Pen the pearls of wisdom and utterance, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Through My remembrance all things have spoken: “The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of the worlds.” There hath befallen thee and My loved ones that which hath caused the cities of God’s justice to lament, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>O Manzar! Behold, then make mention of what hath befallen Us and you in the path of God, the Lord of this wondrous Day. We have made mention of thee and My loved ones in the Crimson Tablet through My Most Exalted Pen. Give them the glad-tidings of this Word, which, when it descended from the heaven of My grace, caused all things to proclaim: “Blessed are ye, O people of Baha, and joy be unto you, O people of Sin and Dal, in that God hath given you to drink the cup of Baha from the hand of bounty, and hath mentioned you in such wise that your names shall endure through the eternality of His mighty and impregnable Kingdom.”</p>
<p>O Iskandar! Know thou that the Alexander whose mention the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an is none other than the Messenger Himself, though most people remain heedless. The barrier was His Word which separated the monotheists from the idolaters. Reflect upon God’s power and dominion: He hath built through the Word that which no eye hath outwardly seen, and hath prevented every remote polytheist from transgressing it. Verily, He is the Master of the two causes and the Observer of the two seas and the Mystery concealed between the two letters. Yet the people remain heedless and say that which no possessor of true insight would ever confirm.</p>
<p>O Sadiq! Thou wast mentioned before, and there was revealed for thee that from which every fair-minded one perceiveth the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

Give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him and of My favor which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth.</p>

Give thou the glad-tidings of God’s loving-kindness to the souls that have been mentioned, and impart unto them that which hath been revealed, that their bodies, let alone their spirits, may soar in this holy, gentle and luminous atmosphere. Verily, We have mentioned My handmaiden and My leaf before and after. We testify that she is among those who have attained in My generous Tablet.

<p>The letter thou didst send to his honor Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, reached this Prisoner. Praise be to God, from it wafted the sweet fragrances of divine love and the gentle breezes of heavenly grace. Blessed is the heart that hath turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, and the face that hath directed itself toward God, the Lord of all beings, and the pen that hath moved in His remembrance and the remembrance of His loved ones, and the tongue that hath uttered His praise. As commanded by the Most Holy, Most Exalted Decree, it was presented in its entirety before His presence, and these sublime utterances and resplendent words were revealed from the heaven of expression of the Lord of all possibility. His word - exalted be His utterance, magnificent His proof, and mighty His sovereignty:</p>
<p>In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>O people of Manshad! Upon you be the Glory of God, His grace, the mercy of God and His peace. Verily the Kingdom of Utterance hath turned toward you and made mention of you in such wise that all mention in the world hath bowed low at its revelation, that ye might rejoice and be numbered among the thankful. His honor Diya, one of My Branches, hath presented your letter and made mention of you before Our presence. We have answered you with that which hath caused rivers of wisdom and utterance to flow from the impenetrable rock, as a bounty from the presence of the All-Merciful. Verily, He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Let not the oppression of the oppressors and the assault of the deniers sadden you. Take what hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen, then recite it morn and eve, in spite of those who denied after having professed their belief, and disbelieved after having believed in God, the Lord of all worlds. By My life! There hath been sent down for you that from which the fragrance of mercy from God, the Mighty, the Great, shall never be cut off. God shall soon seize those who have wronged, and raise up His loved ones through His Name amongst His servants. Verily, He is the Protector of those who profess His unity, who have not broken God’s Covenant and have taken hold of His Book with such strength as hath frustrated all the powers of the world. Blessed is he who hath heard and attained, and woe unto the heedless.</p>
<p>In these days Haifa hath become the seat of the throne of thy Lord, and his honor Siyyid Taqi, upon him be the Glory of God, hath risen to serve with divine assistance. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to confirm him in the Greater Steadfastness in this Mighty Announcement. And We have revealed from the heaven of Our utterance, for those who were martyred in Ya, that which hath enraptured the hearts of those near unto God. Glorified be God! The oppressors of that land have committed that which hath caused wailing and lamentation to be raised from the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven, imagining they would profit from this trade. However, the Most Exalted Pen beareth witness to the loss of these heedless and evil souls. Soon shall they behold the recompense of their deeds - a promise from God, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. And specifically regarding the martyrs, there hath flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur that which is eternally preserved in the Crimson Tablet, meaning it shall remain and endure. We testify that they have attained unto that which none before them have attained, save whom God, the Lord of all worlds, hath willed.</p>
<p>O people of Minshad! That which hath caused all things to lament and the tears of them that know to flow hath befallen you in the path of God. We testify that ye are among the horsemen in the arena of the love of God, who have outstripped all that are in the heavens and the earth. We convey Our greetings and salutations to all the loved ones in that land - salutations whose fragrance shall endure throughout the duration of God’s earthly and heavenly kingdoms and shall be diffused amongst His servants. Blessed are ye and blessed are the patient ones among you. Their reward is assuredly with the Mighty, the Trustworthy.</p>
<p>The breezes of the utterance of the Desired One of the worlds and the fragrances of His verses have been diffused in such wise that the Pen of creation is powerless and incapable to describe them. This Prisoner beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, to make the loved ones aware of that which hath been ordained for them from the Most Exalted Pen. Ere long shall they who possess insight behold the oppressors of the earth in manifest loss and grievous torment. He is the Just One Who hath pledged that He will not overlook the tyranny of the oppressors. We testify that He will fulfill His promise and make manifest that which the Pen hath uttered in the arena of the Tablet. Our Lord is, verily, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>In the letter mention was made of the sons of Mirza Ibrahim, upon them be the glory of God and His loving-kindness. After it was presented before the presence of the Lord of all beings, these clear and decisive verses were sent down from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of Names and Attributes:</p>
<p>In My Name, the One Who speaketh before all faces!</p>
<p>O sons of him who was named Ibrahim! Hearken unto the call that hath been raised from Haifa, the seat of the throne of command. Verily, it transformeth fear into tranquility, sorrow into joy, poverty into wealth, and turning away into drawing nigh. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from this glorious station. Today the treachery in the eyes of the oppressors and that which is hidden in the breasts of the idolaters hath become manifest and visible. The loved ones of this Most Great Revelation are as touchstones for the peoples. Wickedness and immorality have exposed the rejected and tyrannical souls. He is the Mighty One Whom the power of the world cannot weaken, and the determinations of creation cannot prevent His irrevocable decree from being enforced. Whatsoever hath befallen this wronged people at the hands of the oppressors shall assuredly be followed by their punishment and the recompense of the loved ones shall become as manifest as the sun in the world. Blessed are they that draw nigh and woe unto the oppressors.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the souls mentioned will arise to serve the Cause with perfect steadfastness and firm certitude, with wisdom and utterance. In all circumstances hold fast unto wisdom. This is what ye have been commanded in the Tablet and in My perspicuous Book. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>The raindrops of His mercy are beyond reckoning and the fruits of the Tree of His grace surpass counting. This Prisoner beseecheth the True One, exalted be His glory, on behalf of himself and the loved ones and friends, for assistance to hold fast unto such deeds as will cause the Word to be exalted and His loved ones to ascend. Were the people of the earth to meditate for but an hour on that which hath been revealed and sent down, they would turn unto Him, detached from all else save Him. He is the Dawning-Place of loving-kindness and the Day-Spring of mercy. All are poor before the manifestation of His grace and weak before the evidences of His power. The Prisoner declareth:</p>
<p>O my God, my God! Thou seest me ablaze with the fire of Thy love and thankful for the manifestations of Thy bounty. I beseech Thee by the mysteries treasured within the repository of Thy knowledge and the pearls concealed within the shells of the ocean of Thy bounty to aid me and Thy servants to diffuse Thy verses among Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Most Generous, and within Thy grasp are the keys of glory and authority.</p>
<p>Concerning what you mentioned about Jinab-i-Aqa Husayn Haji-Rajab and also Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid, as was said before, many were beheaded. Praise be to God, the lovers in the city of detachment all attained in the path of God to that which had been the ultimate hope of those near unto Him and the sincere ones. I beseech God to grant true vision to the people of the world, that all may become aware of the loftiness, exaltation, glory and majesty of His chosen ones, and likewise become cognizant of their own abasement, darkness, wickedness and presumption. How many souls ran through mountains and suffered in waterless, barren deserts for this Cause! By the life of God, all that befell the martyrs and chosen ones hath been recorded by the Supreme Pen in the Book of Recompense. Verily our Lord is the Just, the Wise.</p>
<p>After these matters were presented before the presence of the Lord of Names and Attributes, these effulgent words and manifest verses were revealed:</p>
<p>He is the All-Knowing, the Wise</p>
<p>O My loved ones! In these days ye made mention of the martyrs, upon them be the splendor of God, the splendor of the Most Exalted Paradise, the Supreme Heaven, and the splendor of the people of Baha by whose light were illumined the worlds which none hath known save God. Be not grieved by what hath come to pass. That which hath been revealed concerning the martyrs and chosen ones is such that the agencies of the heavens and earth cannot equal it. We testify that they took the cup of utterance and drank therefrom in the name of God, the Speaking, the Present, the Manifest, the Trustworthy. Nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.</p>
<p>We wish to make mention of Haji Husayn who attained the presence of God and drank the choice wine of revelation from the hands of bounty. We testify that he attained unto that which was inscribed in the Books of God, the Lord of Lords. His remembrance hath ever been and will continue to be in the presence of the Wronged One.</p>
<p>O people of Minshad! Time and again hath Jinab-i-Siyyid Taqi – upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness – made mention of you, and hath attained Our presence on your behalf, and his deeds have been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Give thanks unto God, the Lord of the mighty Throne and the exalted Seat. O people of Minshad! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, and hold fast unto that which conduceth to the recognition and orientation of the servants.</p>
<p>O Lord! Make things easy, not difficult. O my God, my Lord! Thy servant Diya hath raised the hands of supplication toward the heaven of Thy generosity, and seeketh from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will adorn the saplings of existence with blessed and sublime fruits. I convey greetings, glorification and light to the loved ones of that land, and from the gate of mercy I beseech for each one that which is sanctified above all peer and likeness. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. There is no God but He, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>

And I felt it stirring around my right ear as though it had come with glad tidings from God, the King, the Mighty, the Beautiful. When I turned my ear toward it, by God, it gave me such joyous tidings that I could not remain still within myself. I trembled, and everything that had been created between the heavens and the earth trembled with me. And for this reason I nearly forgot what We intended to mention in this exalted Tablet. O servant! Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having been mentioned at this time wherein all things and all who dwell in the kingdom of the Command have rejoiced. We beseech God to assist thee in His Cause, to rain down mercy upon thee from His presence, and to grant thee a seat of truth with His near servants.

And these very trials and tribulations that have befallen this servant from the year sixty until now, which is eighty, are sufficient reminder for all souls. By God, any being who desires to ascend to the supreme companion and soar to the highest horizons of eternity must surely walk in the footsteps of these servants, so that in all worlds they may fly and move in harmony with the birds of the divine throne. And he who has known God will know none else besides Him and will forget all else save Him. In any case, with perfect joy, delight and gladness, let them be reminded of God’s wondrous remembrances.

Faith in God was not and is not mere claims - this is why He tested all through the touchstone of the Most Great Name’s appearance, that the righteous might be distinguished from the wicked and the pure-hearted from the evil-doers. How lofty is the station of that soul who was not kept back from the Lord of Names and Attributes by the veils and allusions of the peoples of the earth, and who held fast to God’s straight path.

O my Lord! Strengthen my limbs for the service of Your Cause and illumine my sight with the light of meeting You. Then open before the faces of Your servants the gates of attaining Your presence. You are He Who has named Yourself the All-Bountiful and the All-Merciful. There is no God but You, the Single One, the All-Conquering, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O my Lord! You see me turning toward the heaven of Your bounty and awaiting the wonders of Your generosity. I beseech You by the rain-showers of the springtime of Your mercy to send down upon me that which will purify me from the mention of any save You and draw me near to the court of Your holiness.

Verily We have made her to be among the devout ones, and We have sent down upon her mercy from Our presence, and thus hath grace encompassed all things. O handmaiden of God! Rejoice within thyself that thy name hath been mentioned by the Pen of Creation, and this is indeed a mighty grace founded upon truth. Follow thy Lord, then shun all else besides Him. By God, this is the truth, and after truth there is naught save manifest error. Fear God thy Lord, and consort not with those whose faces God hath changed because they disbelieved in God and His verses, and turned away from a Beauty exalted and radiant. Give thanks unto thy Lord, then be steadfast, then bow down and prostrate thyself before God Who created thee by His command, and aided thee to know His Self, and caused the sun of immortality to shine upon thee from the horizon of a wondrous Name. Thus doth God single out whomsoever He willeth of His handmaidens, and ordaineth grace and mercy for every penitent servant. And the glory be upon thee and upon every trustworthy believer.</p>

He hath sent forth the Messengers as bearers of glad-tidings and warners, that they might give the people tidings of a holy and resplendent Paradise.” Say: By God! The Spirit hath appeared with manifest lights of glory, and the Light hath dawned with mighty sovereignty, and the Beauty of the Unseen hath come with an impenetrable vesture. Say: By God! Whosoever hath claimed faith hath been tested by My faith, and whosoever hath claimed love hath been tried by My love. This is what hath been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen upon preserved tablets of glory. Soon shall appear upon the faces of the sinful the dust of fire, and tribulation shall seize them from every direction nigh at hand, except those who have turned their hearts to God and who, when they hear the verses of God, fall down in prostration and weeping. Thus have We expounded the verses for thee and cast upon thee the Word of Truth, and taught thee that which will draw thee nigh unto the court of an exalted Name.

Sorrows have encompassed Us in these days to such an extent that none can reckon them save the All-Knowing One. In such a state We have left them and commit all unto God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. It behooveth him who hath believed in God to follow his Lord in this wise Cause in such wise that neither the prevention of any preventer nor the turning away of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the exalted Throne, shall hinder him.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Mighty, the All-Bestowing! A remembrance unto him who hath turned unto My Kingdom, heard My call and responded thereunto through My grace, and I am verily the Answerer. Today, everyone who hath turned hath attained victory and prospered exceedingly, while he who turned away hath suffered loss, even though he be the one possessed of knowledge and wisdom. When We sent down the verses and revealed the clear proofs, there arose against Us one who had been concealed behind a thick veil. He came forth saying “I am your Lord, the Most High.” We said: “Perdition unto thee, O thou who associateth partners with God and art far removed from Him!” We have counseled all in the Book with that which profiteth them, yet We have found the people to be heedless, save whom thy Lord willeth, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Praiseworthy. Say: This is the Day of Manifestation, the Day wherein mankind hath arisen unto God. Blessed is he who hath heard what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an and then in the Bayan, and woe unto the deniers. The people have turned away, yet the people have arisen to serve God, the Lord of all worlds. Grieve thou not over anything. Rather, rejoice in that a noble Tablet hath been sent unto thee from the presence of the All-Merciful. Verily there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p>O Khalil, who hath emigrated and attained unto the name of the Peerless Beloved! The men and heroes of the world are seen to be heedless of God, although they were created for this Day. The world is the world of divine unity, and all are beheld on one plane. Whosoever hath ascended by the ladder of utterance to the kingdom of meanings, he is the knight of this field and he is the hero of this arena. The divine bounty hath never been, nor ever shall be, limited. How many men among the divines and mystics failed to attain, and how many leaves heard and joined the call of the Tree! How many a learned one was prevented, and how many a handmaiden heard and responded and turned unto the Dawning-Place of the manifestation of her Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful! Praise thou the Beloved of the world, Who hath made mention of thee in the Most Great Prison and favored thee with the effects of the Supreme Pen.

<p>The spirit of all deeds is the good-pleasure of God, for if one should perform all good deeds, yet from them the fragrance of God’s good-pleasure be not inhaled, those deeds will yield neither fruit nor effect nor result. None shall attain unto this most great bounty save through praiseworthy character and goodly deeds, for these matters are the cause of the order of the world and the preservation of nations and will conduce to the exaltation of the Word of God. Therefore it is incumbent upon all to remind heedless souls, with utmost kindness and compassion, of that which will profit them, that all may be immersed in the ocean of God’s good-pleasure. Your honor must strive with the utmost diligence to refine souls and promote unity and concord. Every service rendered today for the sake of God will endure and remain forever. We make mention of thee from Our Most Great Prison that thou mayest remind the people of this Day the like of which hath not appeared in creation.

Thou seest Thy servants imprisoned among Thy creatures, deprived of beholding Thy countenance and visiting Thy presence, bound by the shackles of hatred through what the hands of the transgressors among Thy creation have wrought, and chained in Thy path. Should anyone say that Thou hast withdrawn from them the glance of Thy loving-kindness, all things would deny this, for I observe that Thou art watching over them, and that Thy forbearance with the idolaters is due only to a wisdom which Thou hast concealed from the eyes of Thy servants. Soon wilt Thou raise up those who have fallen in Thy love, and exalt those who have been abased in Thy path, and illumine the faces of those who have been disfigured by the blows of the polytheists for Thy Cause. Thou hast ordained days wherein each one of Thy loved ones shall be raised up through the manifestations of Thy power and the revelations of Thy glory. Such pure ones, who have tasted the edge of swords in their longing for Thy beauty and have drunk poison in their search for Thy presence, are worthy of Thy praise, O Thou Who art the Beloved of Baha! Thou seest Thy Beloved in the prison of ’Akka, desiring not His own ease but Thy good-pleasure and Thy will.

<p>God testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is indeed the Mystery that was hidden and treasured from all eternity. Through Him the Most Great Sign hath appeared, and the Most Exalted Summit hath been raised up, and the Call hath been lifted, and the Balance hath been set. He hath come from the heaven of the Divine Command, with the standards of the Bayan on His right hand and the hosts of revelation with the banners of divine knowledge on His left. Blessed is he who hath heard His call and turned unto Him, and woe betide him who hath denied God and turned away from the Path. O Siyyid Qabl-Husayn, rejoice that the Wronged One hath turned toward thee and mentioned thee with a mention which, when sent down from the heaven of grace, the Kingdom of Utterance bowed down before it. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness, then thank Him in all conditions. He is with His accepted servants and aideth them as He pleaseth, through a command from His presence. He is indeed the Almighty, the All-Choosing. Make mention of My loved ones on My behalf and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for them from God, the Lord of all men.

And how can I fail to make mention of Thee when Thou hast commanded me to do so? By Thy might, O my Beloved!

Thou knowest within Thyself, O my God, that Thou wouldst never abandon Thy lovers or deprive Thy loved ones from the sanctuary of nearness. No, by Thy ancient beauty! Such was never my thought of Thee, nor have we found in how Thou hast dealt with Thy chosen ones anything like what Thou hast visited upon Thy servant. Yet despite all this, I beseech Thee by the fire of Thy beauty - if this head be worthy of the sword of Thy enemies in Thy path, delay not Thy grace regarding it; and if this breast be fitting for the arrows of Thy decree in Thy good-pleasure, then hasten this through Thy bounty. And if Thou shouldst transform all this through Thy sovereignty to manifest Thy creative Will, verily Thou hast power over all this, and art supreme in executing Thy command and fulfilling Thy judgment.

We have sent down for all on earth that wherewith the trees and fruits and mountains have been adorned, yet the people persist in discord and dissension, following vain imaginings while turning away from the Dawning-Place of knowledge. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are reckoned among the wayward in the Book of God, the Lord of creation. We have heard thy call and have answered thee, and have seen thy turning to Us and have turned to thee from the Most Exalted Station, and have remembered thee with that which shall never end, by the everlasting power of God, the Lord of lords. Beware lest the greatest veil prevent thee from the Most Luminous Horizon, or the veils of those who have disbelieved in the Source and Return bar thee therefrom. Take what hath been sent down unto thee with strength from Us, and cast aside what is possessed by every heedless imposter.

The gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with manifest sovereignty. When thou attainest unto My Book say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the Bestower, and by Thy Name, the All-Bountiful, to ordain for me that which shall profit me and abide with me in every world of Thy worlds. And I beseech Thee, O my God, by my presence before Thy face in Thy prison, and by Thy call which hath been raised at all times amongst Thy servants, to make me one of those who have aided Thy Cause through wisdom and utterance. Then protect me through the hosts of the unseen and the seen from those who have disbelieved in Thee and Thy signs, and denied Thy proof and Thy testimony.

<p>O Mirza ’Ab, upon him be the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Great Glory of God! The horizon of inner meanings hath shone forth through this Luminary whereby the horizons were illumined, and the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: “The Kingdom belongeth to the One, the All-Informed!” Through it God hath distinguished between His servants, and His Most Great Name was established upon His mighty throne. How many verses were sent down in truth, and how many evidences appeared through grace, yet most of the people remained asleep, such that they were not awakened by the Cry, nor were they stirred by the Call that was raised amongst creation. They are assuredly among the losers. Soon shall they know what they have wrought in the days of God, and they shall bewail their souls, finding neither helper nor protector. We summoned them to the supreme Paradise and showed them Our most exalted horizon, yet they turned away from all that God, the Lord of the worlds, had brought. Grieve thou not at anything. Rather, rejoice in that thou hast been mentioned before the Throne and this clear Book hath been sent down unto thee. When thou attainest unto it, arise, then turn thy face toward God and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the worlds!”</p>

The Balance hath been appointed by command of the All-Merciful, and the Path hath been set up before all faces, yet most of the people perceive it not. They have turned away from the ocean of knowledge, clinging to their vain imaginings - nay, they do not understand. Say: By God the Truth! The Book hath been sent down through grace, and the Trumpet hath been sounded - and it is My Most Exalted Pen, whereby We have both given and taken away. Verily thy Lord is the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth through His word “Be” and it is. O Abu’l-Qasim!

<p>The Spirit of the Bayan was revealed, yet those within the Bayan and the various sects denied it, except those whom God preserved through His grace - verily He is the Mighty, the Protector. O people of the Furqan (Qur’an), fear God and follow not your vain desires. He guides you to the Dawning-Place of lights. Cast aside what you possess and take what is with God, the Lord of all men. O people of the Gospel, We see you wrapped in heedlessness. Fear the All-Merciful and follow not every ignorant doubter. O people of the Torah, the signs of God have filled the horizons while you remain in doubt and discord. How long will you play with your vain imaginings? Turn to the station wherein the verses of God, the Lord of lords, are sent down at every moment. Thus has My tongue spoken and My pen moved by My command, and I am the Mighty, the Bestower. We have found from you the fragrance of love; We have therefore revealed unto you this Tablet.

Say: Through this Revelation the decree of origination is established and the Nightingale of the All-Merciful hath sung upon the branches of the Tree of Utterance that “There is none other God beside Me, the Single, the All-Informed.” Say: Whosoever affirmeth a likeness hath indeed associated partners with God - to this doth the Ancient Beauty testify from His exalted station. Say: O people of the Bayan! This is the Originator of the heavens and earth, were ye of them that know. Fear God and deny not that in which ye have believed, and commit not that which the people of the Furqan committed aforetime. Fear God and be not of the ignorant ones. Thus hath soared the Bird of Knowledge and cooed the Dove of Utterance upon the branches of the Divine Lott-Tree that thou mayest thank thy Creator, thy Sustainer, and thy Bearer of Glad-Tidings through this wondrous and original Tablet. When My fragrance hath enraptured thee and thou hast found the sweet-scents of My utterance, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world, for having enabled me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy firm and wise Command!”</p>

The fire of hatred and enmity of the world did not prevent it, and the might and dominion of the pharaohs of the earth did not weaken it. It appeared for the sake of God and endured tribulations in the path of God, and there befell it that which hath no likeness or parallel. It became the target of the desires of the opposers, the object of derision of the infidels, and the victim of the harm of the oppressors. Whatever they desired, they carried out against it, for this Wronged One was without helper or assistant. His food was pieces of liver and His drink was heart’s blood. Every day a new harm appeared and a fresh tribulation descended. From the clouds of tyranny, without cease, rained down the arrows of hatred, yet in all conditions the fire of divine love burned more intensely and steadfastness grew stronger.

Before Our presence hath appeared thy letter which thou didst send to the Name of Bounty, upon him be My Glory. We have made mention of thee and have sent unto thee that through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted throughout all possibility. Grieve thou not over anything. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord with such steadfastness as cannot be hindered by the hosts of the world nor by the might of them that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of lords. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Dayspring of the verses of thy Lord when they that are on earth turned away from Him, save such as God, the Lord of creation, did will. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and teach the people, with wisdom and utterance, that which will draw them nigh unto the Self-Subsisting, the Most High. The glory from Us be upon the people of Baha who have not violated the Covenant of God and His Testament and who have quaffed the choice wine of revelation from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Possessor of all existence.</p>

That in which the servants rejoice shall perish and that of which every heedless doubter boasteth shall pass away. We have ordained for you in My most exalted Kingdom that which shall solace the eyes of them that see. Beware, O Yusuf, lest anything prevent thee from God, thy Lord.

Verily He hath appeared with the truth and hath sent down that which is the spirit of life for the people of creation, and the Kawthar of eternity for the Concourse on High, and the Choice Sealed Wine for those who have entered beneath the shadow of this Name through which the Self-Subsisting arose before the Gate and said: “Praise be unto Thee for having shown me Thy Beauty and caused me to hear Thy Call and for having acquainted me with that which was concealed from Thy servants and Thy creation and inscribed in Thy Manifest Book.” Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the Kingdom of Utterance, yet most of the people are heedless. Verily thou, O thou who art mentioned before the Wronged One, give praise for the Ancient Beauty having turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison and mentioned thee in such wise as cannot be equaled by the treasures of the heavens and earth. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>Thy letter hath been illumined by the lights of the Divine Throne and hath attained the honor of being beheld by the Lord of Names. That which is beloved in this day is steadfastness in the love of God, for the manifestations of Satan have appeared with the utmost craftiness - at times preventing people from their Source in the name of the inner meaning, and at times holding back weak souls from the path of divine oneness in the name of the outer meaning. O friends! Through the power of the Most Great Name, remain firm and steadfast on the Most Straight Path, and in all conditions take refuge in the Truth. He is the Protector, He is the Helper, and He is the Succourer of the inner and the outer, and the outer of the outer and the inner of the inner unto whatsoever God willeth. Know ye that in this day He hath appeared at the center of the world as the One circumambulating the Most Great Throne, and account all else as non-existent, extinct and forgotten. This is the counsel of the Most Exalted Pen and the testament of the Lord of Names. Hearken unto it with the ear of the soul and preserve it as thou wouldst thine eye. God forgiveth what is past. Verily He is the Ever-Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>O Mas?ud, son of Mahmud! In the name of the Beloved of the world! Thy letter hath reached the presence of Him Who is the Lord of Names, and thy call hath been heard. May thou be illumined at all times with the lights of the dawn of guidance and be turned in contemplation toward the everlasting Countenance. Two matters are today considered among the most mighty affairs in the eyes of Him Who hath appeared: first, the recognition of God, and second, steadfastness in His Cause. We beseech God to aid His loved ones to achieve the second even as He hath aided them to achieve the first. Praise be to the Beloved of the worlds that thou hast attained unto His recognition and been assisted to remember Him. Now art thou remembered before the Throne. Didst thou know the station of this rank, thou wouldst soar upon the wings of longing. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to aid thee in that which He loveth and is pleased with, to ordain for thee the good of this world and the next, and to give thee to drink, at all times, from the Kawthar of life, that thou mayest arise to make mention of Him and to praise Him amongst His creatures. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Powerful. Convey My greetings unto thy wife and give her the glad-tidings of Our mercy which hath preceded all worlds. Blessed is she in that she hath been mentioned before the Throne and attained unto this mighty grace.</p>

Yea, today the friends of God who have forsaken all who are in creation for His path and held fast to the cord of His love must diffuse the fragrance of faith to such a degree that all the world may perceive it, nay rather that the inhabitants of the graves may attain through that musk-laden breeze to life everlasting. Say: O loved ones of God! Today is the day of burning ardor, today is the day of turning to God, today is the day of mention and praise, today is the day of supreme gladness and greatest joy. All must, in perfect unity, sanctity and detachment, occupy themselves with the remembrance of God, and manifest such warmth in the love of God that the cold-hearted of the world may be set ablaze. This is not difficult for God to accomplish. Strive ye to serve the Cause with the wisdom that hath been revealed in the Tablets. By the life of God! This is a Day that hath no peer or likeness.

Thus hath spoken the tongue of the Will of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, from the direction of the Prison. Be thou thankful and among those who remember. Know thou that We have nurtured Our body in tribulations in the path of God, the Fashioner of the heavens, and We drink at every moment from the cup of destiny that which none among the worlds hath become aware. And the more tribulations increase, the more Our eagerness intensifies, and the more calamities encompass Us, We repel them through the name of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. Be as thou wert in the Cause of thy Master and adorn thyself with the attributes of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise, in such wise that the hardships of the world sadden thee not, nor occupy thee the vanities of all who are in the realm.

By Thy glory! I perceive that the Most Exalted Pen moveth upon the tablet of contingent being and the Tongue of Grandeur speaketh in the paradise of utterance. Yet how can the scratching of Thy servants’ pens or the praise of any of Thy creatures befit Thy presence? That Thou hearest them and answereth them is naught but a token of the wonders of Thy grace and the sublimity of Thy generosity and favors, none having deserved this. I testify, O my God, that it behooveth Thy tongue alone to speak Thy praise and Thy pen alone to move in remembrance and description of Thee. All names fall unconscious at the revelation of Thy Most Great Name, through which Thou hast caused all things to speak forth in Thy days. Therefore I beseech Thee, O God of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, to behold Thy servants and handmaidens with the glances of the eyes of Thy mercy and not to leave them to themselves for less than a moment.

Hidden meanings cannot be reached through such tales - how then can mere words suffice? The customs of the spiritual realms have a new pattern and a boundless name. The names of this cycle are limited and the customs of that sanctified cycle are beyond all bounds and measures. Open the spiritual vista and traverse all realms like lightning. Make wide the field of vision and observe the realm of “thou shalt not see.” Cast a flower into water and it sinks; place a flower upon water and it rests like a crown upon the water’s brow.

Blessed is the state of the one who has today turned towards the most exalted horizon and has been nourished by the fruits of the divine Lote-Tree, which are His profound knowledge and consummate wisdom.

This is a mention from Us to her who has turned to God on a day wherein the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted throughout creation, that it might draw her to a station wherein she becomes detached from all who are on earth for the sake of her Lord, the Mighty, the Luminous. O My handmaiden! Hearken unto the Call from the precincts of the Prison, from the glowing, luminous Fire. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. How many a woman has believed, and how many a man has been prevented due to following vain imaginings. Indeed, bounty is in God’s hand - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the One, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Know thou the worth of what God hath ordained for thee, then give thanks to Him at morn and eventide. Be thou content with what God hath decreed. Verily thy Lord is He Who judgeth as He pleaseth. In this Revelation there hath appeared what hath never appeared before. Blessed are they who are endowed with insight. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, for having made known unto me the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy lights.

<p>O Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, upon thee be the Glory of God! In My Name, the Wronged One, the Stranger</p>
<p>O Abu’l-Qasim! We have seen thy letter and heard the yearning of thy heart in separation from thy Lord, and We understood what thou didst desire of nearness and meeting. But the enemies have come between Us and thee, and have prevented the servants from that for which they were created. Blessed is the one who, strong in spirit, hath rent asunder the veils in the name of his Lord, the All-Bestowing, and hath voiced His praise amidst all possibilities with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance. He is indeed of the people of Glory in the Preserved Tablet of Names, and one who hath embarked upon the Crimson Ark in the name of God, the Possessor of all things and Creator of the heavens. Rejoice thou that We found thy letter adorned with the remembrance of God and sanctified from the mention of aught else but Him, and We observed thy turning unto Him, thy devotion, and thy sincerity towards God alone. Verily He, despite the sorrows that have befallen Him, remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison with that which the world cannot equal. When thou perceivest and findest this, arise in His name, the Exalted, and say: “Unto Thee be praise, O Glory of the World! And unto Thee be thanks, O Thou Who answereth them that turn unto Thee, Companion of them that are nigh unto Thee, Lord of the mystics, and Beloved of the sincere!”</p>

<p>In My Name, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing! O My loved ones! Be not grieved by the actions of those who, throughout all ages, have wronged God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Remember when the Spirit came, and what was inflicted upon Him by the Jews who cast the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds, behind their backs. Then observe what was visited upon Muhammad, the Apostle of God, by all the opposing factions. By God’s life! They are in manifest loss. Verily, whenever He came with the truth, the divines pronounced judgment against Him, and behind them stood the rulers of the earth, if ye be of them that hear. Then remember when the Day of God came - He through Whose mention the books of God were adorned aforetime and Whose manifestation was heralded by the Prophets and Messengers. Woe unto the learned one whom knowledge hath deluded and kept back from God, the All-Protecting, the Self-Subsisting! Say: O ignorant one! Thou wert created for this Day, yet when it appeared thou didst turn away. O rejected idolater! He came to give thee life, yet thou didst pronounce judgment against Him. O heedless and veiled one!

Some souls are firm and steadfast in the Cause of God, while others have loved and continue to love discord, each day clinging to a rope and grasping at the hem of some vain imagination. We beseech the Truth that He may cause all to be steadfast in His Cause, in such wise that the doubts of the heedless and the intimations of the suspicious may not keep them back from the manifest Truth. The Day is His Day and the Cause is His Cause.</p>
<p>Say: My God, my God! I have turned toward Thee and have set my face toward the lights of Thy countenance. I testify that Thou didst create me and make me manifest and nurture me and guide me to Thy straight path and Thy firm and mighty Cause. I beseech Thee by the kingdom of Thy verses and the dominion of Thy power to make me firm and steadfast in Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones who have sacrificed their souls in Thy path and whom the might of princes did not prevent from drawing nigh unto Thee. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayer.</p>

We bear witness that he hath confined affairs to such means as bring rest to the people and the citizenry.

Those souls who were heedless of the root of the Cause and unaware, clinging to the cord of vain imaginings and scattered throughout the cities and regions, are like the previous party, training the servants with vain imaginings. For one thousand three hundred years, heedless souls afflicted the Shiite party with vain imaginings. On the Day of Recompense they committed that which caused the Divine Lote Tree to weep and the Supreme Pen to lament. Until now the deniers of the Bayan have not understood the Day of God.

<p>And We make mention in this station of Abu’l-Fadl who hath been imprisoned for My name. Say: Be not grieved, for ere long the sincere ones shall behold the Sun of Justice shining from the horizon of glory. Thus doth the Lord of all beings inform thee from His mighty prison.</p>
<p>As to what thou hadst mentioned regarding consultation, We have verily made it a ladder of ascent unto the heaven of success and salvation. Well is it with them that take hold thereof and preserve its station. Man’s ascent to the heaven of wellbeing and safety is indeed dependent upon the ladder of consultation. God willing, may the people of God hold fast unto it in all conditions.</p>
<p>O thou who hast attained unto My presence! The immoderation of some in the early days of the Cause was like violent and destructive tempests that uprooted the saplings of assurance and hope. Thus did the government turn away and the people become agitated, for they were heedless of the divine purpose and commandments and acted according to their own desires. Although the morning breeze of revelation was wafting and He Who conversed on Sinai was speaking, yet none witnessed from them any deed befitting the divine days. For this reason did the life of the oppressor gain extension until these days. Every person of insight beareth witness to what hath been mentioned.</p>
<p>O Zein! The clouds of oppression have veiled the moons of justice and prevented their light from shining forth, and the greatest veil has come between the Sun of Justice and the world. The cause and origin of this oppression have been and are the divines. They are the mighty veil and the dense cloud. Hearken unto that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: “They have exchanged the favor of God for disbelief, and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition.” Today, that which will cause the exaltation of the Word and the spread of the Divine Cause is the sanctification of the hearts of His loved ones from rancor and hatred and from whatsoever is unacceptable in God’s sight. I swear by the lights of the Sun of inner meanings that such souls have been and are under the glance of His favor. Their Helper and Succourer is God, exalted be His glory. The oppressor shall be in loss, and the oppressed shall triumph. How excellent was that which was spoken aforetime:</p>
<p>“Thine eyes are closed in slumber while the wronged one remaineth sleepless,</p>
<p>Calling out against thee, and God’s eye slumbereth not.”</p>
<p>Today, pay no heed to outward powers. That which thou seest shall perish, but that which My Most Exalted Pen hath spoken unto thee shall endure. In this Revelation, God hath not and will not grant respite to the oppressor, and if any soul remaineth for numbered days, this is in accordance with the requirements of consummate wisdom. This is another matter. Thy Lord is, verily, the Mighty, the All-Conquering, the Powerful.</p>
<p>In all matters be vigilant regarding the Cause. In the darkness of oppression, be as a brilliant star, and in the midst of turmoil, be at peace through the Name of God. Take counsel together in matters, placing your trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Blessed art thou, O Zein, for having remembered My Name, the Wronged One, the Imprisoned, and for having mentioned it with glory in thy letter. He will surely reward thee with the best of rewards. Verily, He doth not suffer the recompense of the sincere to be lost.</p>
<p>As to what thou didst mention regarding My handmaiden and My leaf, We send her Our greetings from this exalted spot. Give her the glad-tidings of My remembrance of her, that she may thank her Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning what thou didst write about the sale of property, there is no objection. What is essential today is to hold fast to and engage in matters that will cause the elevation of the Cause. God will soon expand your sustenance and send down upon you a blessing from the heaven of His bounty. He, verily, hath power over all things. The selling of property for the purpose of acquiring another house is acceptable before the Face, and God, exalted be His glory, in all conditions hath regard for what is beneficial for His loved ones.</p>
<p>We make mention in this place of thy son Abdul-Husayn, that this may be a treasure for him in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. Every mention that hath flowed from My Most Exalted Pen shall never be exhausted, and shall endure as long as My Most Beautiful Names endure. To this testifieth every discerning one who is endued with insight.</p>
<p>And We make mention of thy other son who hath been named Hasan. O Hasan! Be excellent even as God hath shown excellence unto thee. Then rejoice in His wondrous remembrance of thee. Verily, He hath remembered thee in the Most Great Prison with that which nothing can equal, if thou be of them that understand. Seize upon the remembrance of God and His loving-kindness, and be thou of the thankful.</p>
<p>And We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-’Ali and counsel him with that which will exalt his station among the servants and establish his remembrance in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Thus have We illumined the horizon of thy heart with the Sun of My wise remembrance. Be thou thankful to God for this great bounty.</p>
<p>O ?abib! The Best-Beloved remembereth thee from the prison quarter, while speaking with manifest sovereignty. The conditions of the world cannot frustrate Him, nor the hosts of nations, nor the might of the oppressors. He calleth out with the most exalted call betwixt earth and heaven, and summoneth all to His straight path. He seeth the oppressors but as moths fluttering in the air. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken from His exalted station.</p>
<p>As to what thou hast mentioned concerning the trustees, all of it hath been accepted in the Most Holy Court, and its decree hath previously been issued from the Most Exalted Pen. However, their appointment in the visible world is contingent upon its time. Every matter, when its hour cometh, God shall manifest it in truth. Verily, He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Had We previously designated someone specifically and adorned him with the distinction of appointment, there would assuredly have befallen him that which would have grieved the Concourse of the Near Ones and the Supreme Concourse. However, after the extinction of the kindled fire and its subsidence, let the Council of Consultation designate them in utmost joy and fragrance. In that Council, let them hold fast unto whatsoever conduceth to exaltation, elevation, dignity, composure, goodly deeds, spiritual qualities, words of counsel, and the reformation of heedless souls, according to the requirements of the days, until God shall come with His command. Verily, He hath power over all things. At present, it is more expedient that these souls be confirmed by the signature of the friends in that land, for if the people of hatred and iniquity–that is, the divines of the age–were to become aware of those souls who have been designated by God, they would assuredly harass the princes and ministers with a hundred thousand lies, deceptions, and schemes, and would besmirch matters that are sanctified from the world and its affairs with the clay of their own suspicions and imaginings, presenting them before their presence. Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth and guideth to the way. He is the Ruler, the Commander, the Holy, the Mighty, the Beautiful.</p>
<p>And at the end of the Book, We make mention of thee with another mention, that thou mayest rejoice in God’s bounty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. We have answered thee and decreed for thee what thou didst desire, and We ask God to forgive that for which thou didst seek forgiveness. Verily, He is the All-Merciful from before and after, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of thy Lord’s loving-kindness be upon thee and upon thy family and upon those who have attained unto this manifest Cause.</p>

The tyrants and pharaohs, in their primary station, are the divines of the age who have taken the reins of the people and command them according to the dictates of their own desires. Reflect upon God’s vast grace and mercy - those who considered themselves the most advanced, ancient, ascetic and God-fearing remained heedless and veiled from the Cause and reason of creation, while you, through divine grace, attained recognition of God, exalted be His glory, on the Lord of Days and turned toward the highest horizon.

Bear thou witness unto that whereunto God did testify before the creation of earth and heaven: “There is none other God besides Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.” I have appeared and made manifest My path and My balance which proclaimeth: “I am the Distinguisher, the All-Knowing.” I have sent down My verses and manifested My clear tokens, yet the people remain veiled by a thick veil. They have cast the Command of God behind their backs and followed every froward devil. Among the people are those who denied and turned away, and among them are those who fabricated lies against the Mighty, the Most Praised, and among them are those who issued a decree for My death after I came with the signs of God, the Lord of all worlds. They have abandoned the ordinances of the Book in that they followed the ways of the ignorant ones who cast aside God’s Covenant and His Testament and disbelieved in that which was sent down from His exalted Kingdom. Thus have We sent down the verses [when] the temple of the world was adorned with the ornament of My Name, the Wondrous. The Glory be upon thee and upon those who have hearkened and responded to their Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>

<p>Baku. O Kazim, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Witness from His most exalted horizon. O Kazim! The oppressor desired to extinguish the fire of God with the water of hatred and animosity. Thus did his soul entice him. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Ask God to unveil for him what was hidden from him, that he may abandon what he possesseth, turning toward the horizon which God hath made the Dawning-place of lights. O concourse of friends! Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him. Beware lest the might of those who have denied the Source and the Return cause you to fear. They who have clung to the cord of the Cause - these are the friends of God on earth and His chosen ones in the lands. The Most Exalted Pen maketh mention of them at eventide and at dawn. Say: Beware lest the clamor of the divines hold you back from Him Who is the Possessor of Names. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, clinging to their own books. To this doth the Lord of the world testify from His most sublime station. Thus have We sent down the verses and expounded them in truth and sent them unto thee, that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Bestowing. The Glory shining and manifest from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon those who have arisen and said: “God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the earths and heavens.”</p>

<p>O Nowruz-’Ali, upon whom be the Glory of God, He is the Herald between earth and heaven! O Nowruz, the servant who was present before the Wronged One mentioned your name, and this Preserved Tablet was revealed for you, which had been hidden in the knowledge of God and treasured in the pavilion of grandeur, as a command from Him - and He is, in truth, the Knower of things unseen. We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs and given glad tidings to all of that which will profit them in every world of the worlds of their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Thereupon the servants rose up against Us and the divines issued decrees against Us with such injustice that the Maids of Heaven wept in their chambers and faces and cheeks were altered. Say: O company of the heedless ones! By what book did you believe in your Lord, the All-Merciful, and by what proof did you turn to Him? Bring it forth, if you have knowledge! Nay, by My very Self, the Truth! You have been impotent, as have all who dwell in the heavens and earth, to bring forth that which the Hidden and Treasured Name hath brought. When thou dost discover the fragrance of the divine utterance from the traces of the Pen of the All-Merciful, arise from thy place, turning toward the Dayspring of Revelation, speaking His praise and making mention of that which thou hast been bidden in His recorded tablet.</p>

Join not partners with God, O people, and worship not that which your own hands have fashioned! Better is this for you, if ye be of them that understand”.

The ocean of assurance hath appeared, yet the people are in manifest doubt. They claim faith within themselves, yet they object to the One True God, the All-Informed. Thus have their souls enticed them, and they are truly among the losers. Shun those who prevent people from God, and remind those on whose faces thou beholdest the radiance of bliss. Thus doth the Supreme Pen command thee from the presence of God, the Creator of heaven. Verily, He is the Ruler over what He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>

<p>O Handmaiden of God, Masumih, upon her be the glory of God! In His Name, the Remembering, the All-Seeing! Verily the Book is established upon the throne and hath sent down the Book as a command from His presence, and He is the Book. Verily the Tablet proclaimeth with the most exalted call, saying: O concourse of creation! By God, the Lord of Names hath come with a sovereignty that the circumstances of creation cannot prevent nor can intimations veil. Blessed is the soul that hath stirred and arisen and hastened to the Dawning-Place of remembrance, and woe unto them who have clung to vain imaginings, turning away from God, the Lord of all men. O My handmaiden! Hearken thou unto My call, then bear witness to that whereunto God did bear witness before the creation of earth and heaven, that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. He hath come for the life of the world, yet the peoples have pronounced against Him with an injustice at which the clouds have wept. Fie upon them and upon those who were debarred from the ocean of knowledge and denied God, the Lord of lords.

And woe unto the handmaiden who hath turned away from God and clung to the hem of vain imaginings on this Day wherein the horizon of certitude hath been illumined through the Name of God, the Lord of all worlds. The glory be upon you, O My handmaidens, and upon every handmaiden who hath broken the idols in the name of her Lord, the Possessor of all names, and hath acknowledged that which God acknowledged before the creation of the heavens and earth: that there is none other God but Him, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Among men are those who have forsaken that which is praiseworthy, and among them are those who have held fast to the commandments. Say: He verily seeth him who hath turned unto Him, and heareth the mention of him who remembereth Him in the nights and days. Say: The ocean of utterance hath surged, and the All-Merciful hath spoken forth in this station which God hath made the most exalted of stations. The rivers have flowed, the rains have descended, and the seas have swelled, yet the people remain heedless and in loss. He who hath found the fragrance of the garment hath recognized what is intended. He verily hath acted according to what was commanded in the Book. By the life of God! Nothing shall profit anyone this Day save that which the Lord of all mankind hath decreed.

<p>O Hassan! God willing, mayest thou be confirmed by divine bestowals. Be not grieved at what hath befallen the friends of God through the tyranny of the people. Consider the Manifestations of God Who have appeared from the horizon of the divine Command in bygone ages, and Who manifested themselves in the arena of the world to guide these veiled people. All souls today curse and revile the oppressors of the past, while they themselves are engaged in acts even more grievous. Woe unto them and unto their deeds! Soon shall the Sun of Power shine forth from the horizon of God’s Will and illumine the whole world with the lights of justice. A hundred thousand worlds cannot compare with a single drop of the choice wine of divine love. Whosoever hath attained unto it hath not and will never pay heed to the world and all that dwell therein. Seize thou the days of thy Lord and be of them that remember Him. No harm hath ever befallen or shall ever befall the people of truth except that they shall surely receive its recompense from God.</p>

Concerning the trials and tribulations which thou didst recount, all are known in the presence of the Ancient Beauty. He Himself hath been and will be subject to countless afflictions. Surely His loved ones must also be ordained to receive a portion from this cup. The essential fruit of existence and that which profiteth it hath been the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory. Praise be to God that ye have attained unto this station. He who hath attained unto this station was and is the most wealthy of all the peoples of the world. Be not grieved by the confusion and differences in outward affairs. That which hath been ordained will appear in its time. In this Most Great Revelation, engagement in some occupation hath been prescribed for all the loved ones. Be thou occupied with some matter, placing thy trust in God.

All must be so firm that the contingent happenings of the world shall not debar them from the divine sanctuary. Convey on behalf of the True One My greetings to Ali and his wife.

<p>O friend! The decree of wisdom stands firm, and thus this Wronged One is prevented from mentioning the warbling of the nightingale of divine knowledge. For several years We sojourned in those regions and their surroundings, and associated with many different kinds of people. The fragrances of the roses of inner meanings were diffused and the waters of knowledge were flowing, yet few were the seekers. Glory be to God! The peoples of the world, despite their searching and expectation, are observed to be heedless. The people are occupied with the people, and remain heedless of and veiled from the Truth. Most strange it is that you have turned toward the Friend and sent a letter to the Wronged One of the horizons. God willing, you shall witness from God, exalted be His glory, the recompense of this praiseworthy deed. At the close of this letter, We counsel you with that which befitteth man: to be patient and forbearing, trustworthy and religious, truthful and faithful. The Command is in the hands of God, the Lord of all names and Creator of the heavens. God willing, may you be confirmed in all conditions and occupied with the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory.</p>

A world lies unconscious from the sweet wine of reunion, while these emigrants cry out for but a drop. When will the dark nights of separation and estrangement finally end? Even if lovers’ souls should depart their bodies, when will the messenger of the soul journey from the Sheba of the Beloved?

The choice wine hath appeared and the pure water floweth, and the river of life is before the face of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, calling aloud and saying: “Blessed is he who hath attained in the days of God, and turned toward the horizon of His Revelation, and spoken in praise of His Self, and arose to serve His Cause, and sought refuge in His sovereignty. Woe unto him who was deprived of His sweet savors and remained far from the Kawthar of His nearness and was forbidden from the ocean of His presence. He is among the most wretched of creation, to this doth the Tongue of God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Informed, bear witness.” Thus have We kindled the fire of utterance that through it all creation might be set ablaze, yet the people remain in manifest obscuration. Trust thou in all conditions in the Self-Subsisting, the Most High, then thank Him for having caused to flow upon thee from the ocean of love that whereby thy remembrance shall endure through the eternity of His Best Names.

On that Day shall the Balance be set up and the deeds of all, both small and great, shall be weighed. O people!

Observe the letters: individually these servants comprehend nothing from them and find no definite meaning therein, but after their combination and the appearance of words their meaning becomes clear and manifest, and the influence and effect that appears after their combination was concealed before.

Praise be to God, it spoke of divine unity and the sanctification of His holy Being from any likeness or peer. We beseech Him, exalted be He, by the Beloved through whom the decree of unity was manifested and the banners of detachment were raised, that He may assist you and grant you success, and rain down upon you from the heaven of His bounty a blessing from Him, a table from His presence, and a benediction from His side. Verily He is the Lord of the world and the Educator of the nations. There is none like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, and worthy to answer prayer. Peace be upon you and upon those who love Me and arise to serve My Cause - he who is named Samandar - and upon those with you who have recognized the unity of God, His transcendence, His power, His greatness and His sovereignty.</p>

<p>He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! In most of the Tablets mention hath been made by the Most Exalted Pen of the cawing of the crows. Some were bewildered as to its meaning, while others waited to see what would come to pass. The Most High, the Most Great God hath spoken the truth: that which was foretold in all the Tablets hath come to pass, and the cawing hath been raised from the abode of the sinful one. Glory be to God! Despite having no knowledge of the Divine Cause, they have arisen in opposition in a manner the like of which hath never been heard. O Muhammad-Rida! Upon thee be the Glory of God, the Lord of Names, and upon thy father who attained unto the remembrance of God and the service of His firm and mighty Cause. We have remembered him in such wise that all that is on earth cannot equal it, as every discerning and knowing one doth testify. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My loving-kindness be upon thee and upon him and upon those whose names were mentioned in the Most Great Scene before God, the Lord of Destiny, Who hath come with manifest sovereignty.</p>

If thou askest of Our condition: having not yet been delivered from the prison of Our enemies, We have entered into the prison of Our friends, and having not yet escaped from the bonds of Our foes, We have become caught in the bonds of Our loved ones. Such is Our condition. O ’Ali! The world hath no permanence, but religion hath no end. Therefore, thou must never sell religion for the world, that thou mayest soar on the wings of might and power toward the heaven of the All-Merciful at the time when it was raised up and spread forth in truth. O ’Ali! Until the heart is sanctified from vain imaginings, it will not journey toward the beauty of the All-Knowing Lord, and until the soul passeth beyond all contingent things, it will not hasten to the dwelling-place of the Beloved.

In all Tablets We have counseled the servants of God to manifest pleasing conduct and praiseworthy deeds, and the Most Exalted Pen has repeatedly and successively reminded the friends of God. Nevertheless, some remain occupied with their own desires and are deprived of that which is beloved today. Ask God to unite all through His complete power and consummate wisdom, that all may speak with one tongue and gather and protect the scattered sheep with one crook. Say: Forsake your own utterances and speak forth that which has dawned from the horizon of the Divine Will, for this is what is firmly established, what attracts, what guides, and what leads. That which flows from the Divine Pen aims at the preservation of the world and the attainment of the Most Great Station. He is verily the All-Knowing Witness.

Reflect upon him who was named with thy name and offered up his spirit in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds. He attained to the most great steadfastness and sacrificed his spirit and his wealth in the path of God in such wise as to astonish the hearts of the mystics and the minds of the learned ones who cast the ordinances of God behind their backs and followed their vain desires. They are indeed in manifest error. The fire of tyranny hath been kindled in the land of Sad through that which the hands of them that disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great, have wrought. The serpent did bite the kindred of the Apostle and plundered their possessions. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

<p>Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I swear by Thy might! Successive afflictions have withheld the pen of the Most High from laying bare that which is hidden from the eyes of Thy creatures, and incessant trials have hindered the tongue of the Divine Ordainer from proclaiming the wonders of Thy glorification and praise. With a stammering tongue, therefore, I call upon Thee, O my God, and with this my afflicted pen I occupy myself in remembrance of Thy name.</p>
<p>Is there any man of insight, O my God, that can behold Thee with Thine own eye, and where is the thirsty one who can direct his face towards the living waters of Thy love? I am the one, O my God, who hath blotted out from his heart the remembrance of all except Thee, and hath graven upon it the mysteries of Thy love. Thine own might beareth me witness! But for tribulations, how could the assured be distinguished from the doubters among Thy servants? They who have been inebriated with the wine of Thy knowledge, these, verily, hasten to meet every manner of adversity in their longing to pass into Thy presence. I implore Thee, O Beloved of my heart and the Object of my soul’s adoration, to shield them that love me from the faintest trace of evil and corrupt desires. Supply them, then, with the good of this world and of the next.</p>
<p>Thou art, verily, He Whose grace hath guided them aright, He Who hath declared Himself to be the All-Merciful. No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, the Supreme Helper.</p>

Praise be unto Thee for having enabled me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Dayspring of Thy Cause, and for having turned me toward the Kawthar of Thy Revelation and the Salsabil of Thy inspiration. By Thy glory! Were I to render Thee thanks throughout the duration of Thy Kingdom and Thy dominion, I would find myself powerless to repay that wherewith Thou hast favored me through Thy grace and bounty. Thou art He Who caused me to turn unto Thy countenance on a day when all had turned away from Thee and remained distant from the shore of Thy nearness, save those whom Thou didst show the pathways of Thy sanctification and the ways of Thy guidance. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which earthquakes have seized most of the servants, to make me so fixed in my gaze upon Thee in all conditions that nothing may prevent me from that which hath been ordained by the Pen of Thy decree and sent down in the scrolls of Thy glory. O Lord! Make my hope Thy remembrance, my deed Thy praise, my purpose Thy purpose, and my good-pleasure Thy good-pleasure, that I may be effaced from myself and endure through Thy Name, the Ever-Abiding, the Everlasting, the Mighty, the All-Wise.

<p>All praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God! How mysterious the Fire which Thou hast enkindled within my heart! My very limbs testify to the intensity of its heat, and evince the consuming power of its flame. Should my bodily tongue ever attempt to describe Thee as the One Whose strength hath ever excelled the strength of the most mighty amongst men, the tongue of my heart would address me, saying: “These are but words which can only be adequate to such things as are of the same likeness and nature as themselves. But He, of a truth, is infinitely exalted above the mention of all His creatures.”</p>
<p>The power of Thy might beareth me witness, O my Well-Beloved! Every limb of my body, methinks, is endowed with a tongue that glorifieth Thee and magnifieth Thy name. Armed with the power of Thy love, the hatred which moveth them that are against Thee can never alarm me; and with Thy praise on my lips, the rulings of Thy decree can in no wise fill me with sorrow. Fortify, therefore, Thy love within my breast, and suffer me to face the assaults which all the peoples of the earth may launch against me. I swear by Thee! Every hair of my head proclaimeth: “But for the adversities that befall me in Thy path, how could I ever taste the divine sweetness of Thy tenderness and love?”</p>
<p>Send down, therefore, O my Lord, upon me and upon them that love me, that which will cause us to become steadfast in Thy Faith. Enable them, then, to become the Hands of Thy Cause amongst Thy servants, that they may scatter abroad Thy signs, and show forth Thy sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, Who art powerful to do whatsoever Thou willest. Thou art, in truth, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>

Among them are those who have turned towards Him and those who have turned away and followed every heedless and veiled one. Place thy trust at all times in the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. He will assist thee through His command “Be,” and it is. Thus hath My Pen spoken and My Tongue made mention and My Face turned unto thee.

Blessed is the countenance that hath turned toward the Face of the Beloved, and blessed is the heart that hath been illumined by this Sun through which those in the heavens and on earth have been enlightened. O people! Cast aside your idle fancies and turn toward the Dayspring of certitude. Thus doth the All-Merciful command you, if ye be of them that know. We have been remembering the loved ones in the night seasons and at dawn, that the verses of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, may draw them nigh. I beseech God to aid thee to assist His Cause, to enable thee to voice His praise, and to ordain for thee in the Kingdom that which He hath ordained for the sincere ones.

<p>O Mashhadi Aqa Muhammad! The Most Great Vision hath appeared, and the Lord of Destiny speaketh therein that there is none other God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. All things have perceived the fragrance of the utterance of the Lord of Names, yet most of the people comprehend not. They have cast the Book of God behind their backs, having followed the book of their own selves - nay, they perceive it not. That which was promised unto the servants hath come to pass. Well is it with the one possessed of such strength that he hath turned toward the Most Sublime Horizon in such wise that the hosts could not weaken him. Say: By God! This is a Book from which the followers of true knowledge, who have borne witness to that which God hath testified - that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving - perceive the fragrance of the All-Merciful. Thus have We sent down the verses from the heaven of utterance and dispatched them unto thee, that thou mayest thank the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. From this station do We send Our greetings upon the faces of My loved ones who have fulfilled My Covenant and My Testament, and who have clung to the hem of My sacred and beloved robe. Grieve not for what hath befallen thee in My path. He will surely reward thee through His grace, for He is the All-Bountiful, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.</p>

The fragrance of the spiritual garden hath been wafted from the breezes of Revelation, and the ocean of certitude hath surged through this wondrous and glorious movement. O peoples of the world! Turn ye unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, and be not of them that slumber. Say: Arise through My Name, then speak forth My beauteous praise. I created all things for the knowledge of the Lord of Names. Yet when the veil was lifted and the lights of the Countenance shone forth from the Supreme Horizon, they opposed and turned away from Him, save those who drank the pure wine of inspiration from the utterance of God, the Almighty, the All-Compelling, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Blessed is he who hath held fast unto that which is approved and hath wrought in the path of God that whereby the hearts of the troubled were tranquillized.

How excellent is the state of the one who hath become detached and freed from all else save God and hath turned towards the Most Great Ocean.

One pure deed today is better than the deeds of countless years. Fear God, O people, and be not of those who cast the deeds behind their backs and cling to idle fancies and words. Deal with the servants with utmost love, fellowship, affection and unity, that perchance the sleeping ones may awaken and turn towards the Friend.

The Wronged One approaches thee from the prison quarter and summons thee to the sovereign of all deeds, which is steadfastness in this Cause - that Cause which, when it appeared, caused the pillars to tremble and the mountains to pass away like clouds. Rejoice in the Tablet of thy Lord, then give thanks to Him in the watches of the night and the ends of the day. Verily the most excellent of deeds, and the greatest of them, is recognition of Him Who is the Manifestation of the Hidden Mystery, and after this steadfastness, which the All-Merciful hath sent down in the Book. Say: O God of kings and the Merciful One to the servants and the Ruler of the Kingdom! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which the rains were caused to fall and the seas to surge and the trees to speak, that Thou assist me to be steadfast in this Cause which, when it was revealed, caused feet to slip. Hold fast unto that which thou art commanded. By the life of God! The world shall pass away, but there shall endure for thee that which hath been sent down from God, the Revealer of verses.</p>

We have sent down the verses and manifested the clear proofs, yet the people have turned away and objected in such wise as caused the dwellers of the most exalted Paradise to lament, and God is witness to what I say. Say: O people of the earth! Cast away your vain imaginings. The Lord of all beings hath come with a sovereignty that encompasseth all who are in the kingdoms of command and creation. When thou hast attained unto My Tablet and discovered from it the fragrance of My loving-kindness, arise and say: Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thyself and made me know the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Source of Thy commandments and ordinances. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance and the waves of the ocean of Thy knowledge to make me so steadfast in Thy love that the veils of the world will not prevent me.

<p>In the Name of the one incomparable God! The Dawning-Place of divine verses and the Dayspring of heavenly evidences, Shir-’Ali, hath several times tasted the sweetness of imprisonment and incarceration in the path of the Friend. First he was cast into prison in the Land of Ta (Tehran), and afterwards in Mazandaran in the city of Amul he fell into the hands of the wicked ones and dwelt in prison, and yet again for a third time in the Land of Ta he was favored with the bounty of imprisonment and adversity and tribulation, bound with chains and fetters. Blessed is he upon whom hath befallen that which befell his Lord! Be not saddened by what hath come to pass. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of the All-Merciful’s utterance that grief in the path of the Friend is better and sweeter than a hundred thousand joys. Soon shall the oppressor witness the supreme remorse and the oppressed the most great glad-tidings. We enjoin all the loved ones of God to patience and steadfastness. Verily He commandeth you that which profiteth you in all the worlds of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Rejoice thou in My remembrance and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the dominion of all worlds!</p>

He had a brother who protected Him for a number of years and taught Him a letter from the Tablet of the Command. Through this he grew proud before God Who had created him by the word of His command, and became one of the transgressors. The names so deluded him that he sought to slay his Brother without any proof from God or any enlightening Book. None in the heavens or on earth can reckon his schemes.

Therein He maketh mention of the servant of God who heard the melodies of Paradise from the mouth of God, his Lord and the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>O servant! Give thanks unto thy Lord for having enabled thee to attain His presence, inasmuch as thou hast visited the Ancient Beauty when He shone forth from the horizon of Iraq with mighty holy splendors. By God! To hear but one melody from the mouth of God is better than all that hath been treasured in the heavens and earth, and thy entry into the Spot of God is better for thee than whatsoever hath been created on earth - and God is witness unto this. Know thou thy station, for thou hast been honored with that which countless souls have died in their longing for. Yet strive within thyself lest this bounty be changed - and this is indeed a mighty counsel. Preserve the love of God in thy heart lest it be erased by the intimations of the polytheists. And the glory rest upon thee and upon those who have believed in God, the True King, the Manifest.</p>

<p>O God of the Concourse on High and the One manifest from Thy Most Glorious Horizon! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy wisdom and the sun of Thy wisdom to make me among those women who have drunk the choice wine of revelation from the hand of Thy bounty and whom the intoxication of recognition hath so seized that they have detached themselves from all contingent things and turned with their whole being to the Dawning-Place of Thy verses and the Day-Spring of Thy clear signs. O my Lord! Behold this poor one who hath risen before the gate of Thy generosity and clung to the cord of Thy riches and held fast to the hem of the robe of Thy bounty. Hard it is for Thy handmaiden to perceive Thy fragrance from the direction of Thy prison. By Thy glory, O God of the world! Hard it is for me to see Thy servants dwelling in palaces in Thy days while I behold Thee in the most desolate of Thy lands and the most distant of Thy realms. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all created things to ordain for Thyself that which shall gladden the eyes of Thy creation and rejoice the hearts of Thy trusted ones and Thy leaves. Verily Thou art the Almighty over what Thou willest and Thou art the Ordainer, the Answerer, the All-Knowing.</p>

I beseech Thee, O Light of hearts and Enchanter of breasts, to ordain for every soul that which befitteth Thy grandeur and Thy generosity and is worthy of Thy sovereignty and Thy bounty. O Lord! Withhold not Thy chosen ones from drawing nigh unto the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy laws. Then inscribe for them from the Most Exalted Pen that which will vouchsafe unto them Thy presence and the visitation of Thy Beauty. O Lord! They are poor and Thou art in truth the All-Possessing; they are weak and Thou art in justice the All-Powerful; they are athirst in their separation and with Thee is the Kawthar of life, O Thou Who art the Lord of all existence.

He is, verily, none other than God, the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. He hath sent the Messengers and revealed the Books as a token of His grace, yet most of the people render not thanks. They deny the favor of God even as the idolatrous servants denied it before. In all conditions thou must hold fast to the cord of divine providence of the Self-Subsisting Lord. God hath been and will ever be watchful over His loved ones. He is the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing. Today the gates of grace are opened wide and from the clouds of providence perfect mercy is being showered down. Strive that thou mayest not be deprived and that thou mayest attain unto that which is intended. Thy name was mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and there flowed from the Most Exalted Pen that which the treasures of the earth cannot equal. Read it with joy and delight, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful, Who revealed the Furqan and the Bayan and guided thee to His straight path.

Blessed is the soul whom the doubts of the aggressive ones and the veils of the heedless ones prevented not from the Law of God nor held back from hearkening unto His Word.

Jenab-i-’Abdu’l-Karim appeared before Us with the letter of Jenab-i-Mulla Muhammad-Baqir, and it attained unto the honor of being heard.

We beseech God that He may aid them all to perform such deeds whose fragrance shall never be cut off from the cities of justice and fairness. Some time ago, as commanded, this servant sent a letter containing divine verses addressed to the aforementioned one, upon whom be My glory. The ocean of mercy was surging therein and the sun of divine loving-kindness was dawning and shining forth from the horizon of its words. Blessed is he who hath attained unto the Kawthar of My Cause and the choice wine of My wondrous utterance. On behalf of the Wronged One, convey greetings to all and remind them of the signs of the Most Exalted Pen.

He hath made His Cause manifest, His Path evident, and His Balance established before all faces. This is that Day whereof He saith: “The trumpet shall be blown, and all who are in the heavens and on earth shall swoon away, save those whom God shall please to exempt.” Though the Cause is mighty indeed, yet its proof and testimony are seen to be clearer than the light of the sun. It behooveth thee to return unto God and repent before Him. Verily, He will forgive thy sins and blot out thy transgressions. Thy Lord is, in truth, the All-Forgiving, the Most Generous. Through His grace and mercy, God hath pardoned and overlooked grievous sins and great transgressions, on condition that one’s return be firm and one’s repentance steadfast and enduring.

<p>Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name, and by the breaths of Thy Revelation amidst the nations, and by Thy hidden mysteries within Thy knowledge, and by Thy manifest signs before the faces of Thy creation, to aid me to serve Thy Cause in such wise that the doubts of the heedless and the gestures of the clamorous may not prevent me from turning toward the horizon of Thy Manifestation and drawing nigh unto the court of Thy glory. O my Lord! Assist me to detach myself from all else save Thee and to hold fast unto the cord of Thy Cause. Verily Thou art powerful to do what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

Your mention hath been made and thy name hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Know thou the worth and station of this most great favor. Divine bounty hath ever encompassed and continueth to encompass all - the seeing and the blind, the learned and the ignorant, male and female - all stand in one spot. Whosoever hath attained unto the blessed words “O My servant” and “O My handmaid” is reckoned among the people of Baha, inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Recognize the bounty of thy Lord and be among the thankful ones in the Book of God, Lord of all worlds. Verily the grace is in His hand and the bounty in His grasp. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Blessed is the handmaid who hath attained, and woe unto the servant who hath been deprived of drawing nigh unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We beseech God to assist His handmaidens to sanctification and detachment, and to the chastity which God hath made the first ornament of His steadfast handmaidens and steadfast servants.</p>

Blessed is the soul that has attained unto the Word of God and whose mention has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen.

God gave glad-tidings through the tongue of His Prophets and His Messengers, yet when He appeared the divines denied Him, as did those who followed them without any proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remember when Muhammad, the Apostle of God, came, the people turned away from Him and those who violated God’s Covenant and His Testament opposed Him, following every rebellious satan. Blessed is he who hath attained unto this Day and discovered the fragrance of the garment and was moved by the will of his Lord, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. Thy letter hath arrived and the servant present before the Wronged One hath presented it, and We have answered thee with that from which those near unto God perceive the fragrance of His bounty, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

The Supreme Pen testifies that thou hast turned to the Great Announcement and art oriented toward the Most Exalted Horizon, which is the station of the dawning of that Most Great Luminary. Today the Sun of Truth is His dawning - that Announcement wherewith all the Prophets gave glad tidings to the servants, and wherewith the divine Books, Scrolls and Psalms were adorned and embellished. The land of Syria hath been perfumed by His advent, and Sinai hath attained to His appearance, while the people remain in a mighty veil. Ere long the station of those servants and handmaidens who have turned unto Him shall become manifest to all who dwell on earth. Verily, the heedless on that Day shall be in grievous sorrow. Thus doth the All-Knowing inform thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the All-Informed.

How many of the divines, theologians and men of learning are seen to be deprived on this day, while thou, through His infinite bounty, hast quaffed the choice wine of recognition from the cup of His bestowal and turned thy face toward the horizon of His manifestation. Know thou the station of this most great favor and preserve it through the Name of God. We send greetings to the leaves in that land and summon them unto God, exalted be His glory. God willing, may all attain to that which beseemeth the Day of God. Mighty is the Cause and mighty the Day. This is that Cause which was mentioned and recorded in the former Books.

Glorification and peace be upon His loved ones and chosen ones whom neither the swords of rulers nor the clamor of divines could deter from God, the Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. These are God’s party in the earth and His signs in the lands. Through them was made manifest God’s straight path and His firm and mighty Cause. We have heard thy mention and have remembered thee and turned toward thee through the grace of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. This is the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Remembrance, and the Day whereof the Mother Book and the Books of old gave glad tidings. Blessed is he who hath recognized it, and woe unto the heedless. The glory shining forth from the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon every discerning one possessed of insight. Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p>In His Name, the Speaker, the All-Knowing! Praise be to God! The heaven of divine exposition hath been raised high and adorned with the stars of knowledge and utterance. The Sun of Truth hath risen from its horizon, yet the people remain heedless and veiled therefrom, inasmuch as they have been nurtured by vain imaginings and are gazing at its dawning-place. By the life of God! The ignorant ones of the earth who today are known as divines have been and continue to be the fountainhead of vain imaginings, except such as God hath willed, the Lord of the worlds. In this day, should a person appear with all the sciences, yet remain deprived of the splendors of the lights of the Sun of knowledge which hath shone forth from the horizon of the Prison, he would be accounted among the most ignorant of all in the presence of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. And should a person know not a single letter of learning, yet be adorned with the ornament of the love of God, he would be recorded by the Supreme Pen as among the most learned of all. Woe unto the learned one who hath been debarred from the ocean of knowledge, and blessed is the unlettered one who hath heard, hastened, and attained unto the recognition of God, the Knowing, the Informed.</p>

When thou attainest unto this, say: “Praise be unto Thee, O God of earth and heaven, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy knowledge and caused me to hear Thy call from the direction of Thy prison, and honored mine eyes with beholding the traces of Thy Most Exalted Pen. I beseech Thee, O my God, by Thy verses and Thy clear proofs, and by the rustling of Thy Lote-Tree and Its fruits and leaves and branches, to aid me to perform such deeds as shall diffuse the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure.” This is my purpose and the purpose of the sincere ones. Praise be to God, before and after. Thou hast previously attained unto the Divine Tablet. In these days thy mention hath repeatedly been made in the presence of the Wronged One.

Lo, the Lamp declareth: “The All-Glorious is come!” And the Fire crieth out: “The Chosen One hath appeared!” And the Water proclaimeth: “The Ocean of grace hath surged forth in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all worlds!” Blessed is the seeker who hath turned toward the Desired One, and the pursuer who hath sought after Him Who is the Goal of all in the heavens and the earth. O peoples of the earth! Hearken unto that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttereth from the most exalted station. Cast away what ye possess, then turn with illumined hearts toward the court of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful. Beware lest the conditions of men prevent you from your Lord, the Creator of all things. Leave the world behind you, turning unto God, the Forgiving, the Generous. That which ye possess will profit you not this day. Have mercy upon yourselves and be not of the transgressors. Hasten unto the stream of the favors of your Lord, the Glorious, the Praiseworthy.

And he announced to all this Revelation at whose appearance the Hour was troubled and all who dwell on earth and in heaven were thunderstruck, save whom God willed, the Mighty, the All-Wise. He spoke forth this Name and proclaimed this momentous News. Yet when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, He was denied by the peoples of the earth and behind them the people of the Bayan who violated the Covenant even as the followers of past religions had violated it before them.

These leaves have been moved from their outward homeland and dwelling by the winds of the divine Will and drawn to the eternal divine homeland. Therefore, it is more fitting for any opposer to prevent the winds rather than prevent the leaf, for the will and movement of the leaf depends upon this divine breeze and holy, glorious zephyr. And as long as He continues to blow and pass by, this leaf shall remain in motion, attraction and fervor. Exalted then is this breeze which bloweth from the direction of holiness and payeth no heed to the opposition of them that are in the realm, and exalted is He Who sent it with truth - verily He is the Mighty, the Generous. God willing, may the loved ones of God ever drink from the wine of His love and remain focused on His direction. And the glory be upon thee.</p>

<p>In the Name of the Beloved of the Worlds! The beginning of all things is the recognition of God, exalted be His glory, and the end thereof is steadfastness in His Cause. Blessed is the one who hath perceived the cause and reason for the veiling of the people and hath arisen to serve the divine Cause with clear certitude. Whosoever hath turned with insight and faced toward the most exalted horizon shall not be prevented by earthly events and the clamor of men. Thus hath testified the Supreme Pen as its voice was raised between earth and heaven, and behind it the Tongue of God, the Lord of all worlds. The greater the Revelation, the greater shall be the trials, hardships, tests and tribulations. One must at all times hold fast to the firm cord, that ye may be preserved from the doubts of the heedless, the hints of the deniers, and the clamoring of the barking ones. Thus doth He Who hath turned toward thee from the direction of His Most Great Prison teach thee, purely for the sake of God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p>In the name of the One True God! At first dawn We arose and turned Our face toward a garden which was known by the name of the True One. When We entered therein, We found all things rejoicing in the Kawthar of attainment unto His presence. From each of the trees and flowers and leaves and fruits We heard the cry “The Kingdom is God’s!” O thou who hast turned thy face toward My horizon! The intoxication of the divine utterance hath so seized the things of that garden that every atom of its dust is engaged in wondrous and sublime songs in praise of God, exalted be His glory. This is the Day for which all those who were nigh unto God and were sincere sought His presence, exalted be His glory, and the divine Books bear witness unto this truth. Blessed are they who have attained unto the hearing of the call and who have been honored to behold the horizon. The eye was created for this Day and the ear for these times, inasmuch as the call of the Beloved of the worlds is raised aloft and the horizon of Beauty is illumined with the light of His countenance. The traveler mentioned thee, and this Most Holy, Most Exalted Tablet, with which the entire world cannot compare even with a single letter thereof, hath been revealed that thou mayest rejoice thereat and speak forth the praise of God, exalted be His glory. The command is in His hand, and He is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. If thou shouldst find a friend, convey to him greetings from the Wronged One and say: “Beware, beware lest thou deprive thyself in the days of God. Leave the world through the Most Great Name. Verily, He will protect thee and guide thee unto the path of God, the Mighty, the One, the Single, the All-Knowing.”</p>

And likewise I counsel them to two most excellent attributes: religiousness and trustworthiness. Blessed is the soul that in this divine Day hath turned towards Him and attained the verses of the Supreme Pen. Know thou the value of the utterance of the All-Merciful, and preserve and read the blessed Tablet, that perchance through the attraction of the Call thou mayest attain unto that which God hath purposed. We beseech God to aid thee and grant thee success, that thou mayest spend thy remaining days in His love and remembrance, and at the time of ascension mayest turn, detached from the world, unto the Supreme Companion.

Were you to become aware of His bounty and grace, you would find yourself so joyous that the world’s darkness could not change it. Know thou the value of these days and then thank thy Lord for having aided thee to recognize Him when every distant learned one and every doubtful servant turned away from Him. All handmaidens of God must act according to what God hath revealed in the Book. The ephemeral days have passed and are passing.

Occupy not the days of your lives with the betterment of your own affairs; arise, rather, for the betterment of the world. Such indeed is the station of the people of Baha as recorded in the Crimson Book by the Pen of the Most High. Show forth the utmost love to all the peoples of the world and the diverse kindreds of the earth. The One True God, exalted be His glory, beareth Me witness!

Whatever they desired was fulfilled, and whatever they uttered was heard. The purpose of all that was manifested was that ears might become ready to hearken unto one exalted Word, and that is this: O people of the earth! Make not God’s religion a cause of enmity. If this Word were to take hold in the world, all would find themselves at ease and in comfort. Say: By the life of God!

<p>In reply to Abdul-Husayn’s letter, write: Regarding what was mentioned about differences between the friends - all are obligated by the Divine Tablets to demonstrate love, unity, affection and fellowship, which are the cause of exalting the Word of God, and they must act accordingly. We beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to enable all the friends to attain to this most exalted station, so that all may arise in unity to serve the Cause. Mention of you was made in the Most Holy Presence, and you have attained to God’s favors. According to His command: those souls who are today associated with the Truth and adorned with the lights of recognition must strive to remove differences, for no harm has been or will be greater than discord between the friends. God willing, you will strive to the extent possible in this matter. God speaks the truth and verily guides to the straight path.</p>

<p>O handmaid of God! In the name of the one true God! The heaven of divine tablets is illumined and bright with the mention of the Luminary of steadfastness, as in most tablets it hath been revealed and recorded from the Supreme Pen. Nevertheless, some are observed to be deprived of a single letter from the sanctified Word by reason of the prison of self, despite that they should be witnessed in such wise that were all the manifestations of knowledge and their dawning-places to appear, they would be unable to prevent a single soul from the divine path. How great is the difference between their station and the station they occupy! Glory be to God! The Pen is bewildered and uttereth “We are God’s and to Him we shall return.” We beseech God to assist His servants and handmaidens to remain steadfast in this mighty Cause. O handmaid of God! Give thanks to God, exalted be His glory, that He hath illumined thee with the lights of the Throne and caused thee to attain the recognition of the ocean of meanings.</p>

Be thou thankful unto thy Lord, then recognize the station of thy father. Verily he hath a station with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Then remember thy brother whom God hath exalted through a sovereignty from His presence and named him with His wondrous name. Thy letter hath been presented before the Throne and We have heard that wherewith thou didst commune with God. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. Thy call was heard and thy letter was observed. God willing, thou shalt ever be speaking in praise and glorification of God and remain steadfast in His Cause. The Supreme Pen counsels all His loved ones to the Most Great Steadfastness, and this station hath been and is the most great of all stations with God.

<p>O handmaiden of God! In the name of the Purpose of all worlds! The one God adorned man with the ornament of utterance, and this utterance is special to him and through it man is distinguished from animal. In the Furqan, which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, He says: “He created man, taught him utterance.” Blessed are those souls who today have drunk the water of everlasting life from the hand of divine bestowal. The intimations of the world and the might of nations and their turning away and heedlessness did not prevent those holy souls. They let go what was with the people and took up what appeared from divine inspiration with heavenly power and might. Today males and females are seen on the same plane. But O my handmaiden, by what the Tongue of Grandeur has spoken in thy name in His Most Great Prison, we ask of God that He assist thee in that which is the cause of exaltation and the means of elevation.

Whoso turns today to the Most Exalted Horizon is reckoned among the people of mystic knowledge in My perspicuous Book. And he who acknowledges that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken is accounted among the learned ones in the sight of God, the Lord of the worlds. But he who turns away from the Countenance is the most ignorant of men, even should he come with the knowledge of the first and the last ones. Verily, We manifested knowledge for the recognition of the Known One, but when He appeared, every remote scholar turned away from Him. Thus did the Tongue of Grandeur speak when He was in the midst of the heedless ones. Grieve thou not over anything. In all matters put thy trust in God, the King, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Glory be upon the people of Baha who have cast away idle fancies and taken hold of that which they were bidden by One mighty and powerful.</p>

He, verily, is the Ancient Bestower. Thy letter hath been presented and the servant who standeth before the Countenance hath read it, and We have answered thee. Verily thy Lord is the Answerer. He heareth the call of them that have believed and answereth every one who hath turned towards the Supreme Horizon. He hath verily named Himself the All-Bountiful. We counsel thee to show forth the utmost steadfastness in the Cause of God, the Lord of the throne on high and of the earth below. How many a servant whom We counseled thus, yet when We tested him with but a single word, his feet did slip from My straight Path. When thou hast read this Tablet and been illumined by the lights of certitude, say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, the All-Merciful, for having enabled me to recognize the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thine inspiration. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy Cause and in Thy love under all conditions. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Almighty.</p>

We have heard your cry […] that you may rejoice and thank your Lord, the King of the Day of Mutual Calling. Blessed is My name that entered the prison for My remembrance and My love, and blessed is every name that was touched by hardship and adversity for this Name, before which, when it appeared, all names bowed down in submission, as the Mother Book bears witness in this exalted station. Beware lest the affairs of creation prevent you. Leave what they have and take what has been given you from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

Make manifest unto them Thy clear and straight path that they may all attain unto Thee and turn their faces toward the pavilion of Thy nearness. O Lord! Look not upon them and their deeds, but rather look upon Thy mercy and bounty, Thy loving-kindness and Thy favors. Thou hast ever been independent of the worship of Thy creation and self-sufficient above the assistance of Thy servants.

The clouds of the heaven of Thy bounty have rained their rain on this City within whose walls is imprisoned Him Whose desire is the salvation of Thy creatures. Through it the soil of this City hath been decked forth, and its trees clothed with foliage, and its inhabitants gladdened.</p>
<p>The hearts of Thy dear ones, however, will rejoice only at the Divine Springtime of Thy tender mercies, whereby the hearts are quickened, and the souls are renewed, and the trees of human existence bear their fruits.</p>
<p>The plants that have sprung forth, O my Lord, in the hearts of Thy loved ones have withered away. Send down upon them, from the clouds of Thy spirit, that which will cause the tender herbs of Thy knowledge and wisdom to grow within their breasts. Rejoice, then, their hearts with the proclamation of Thy Cause and the exaltation of Thy sovereignty.</p>
<p>Their eyes, O my Lord, are expectantly turned in the direction of Thy bounty, and their faces are set towards the horizon of Thy grace. Suffer them not, through Thy bounty, to be deprived of Thy grace. Potent art Thou, by Thy sovereign might, over all things. No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p>Lauded be Thy name, O my God! I can discover no one in Thy realm who can befittingly turn unto Thee, or is able to adequately hearken unto what hath gone out of the mouth of Thy will. I beseech Thee, therefore, O Thou Who art the Possessor of the entire creation and the King of the realm of Thine invention, graciously to aid Thy creatures to accomplish that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Thee, that they may arise to serve Thy Cause amidst Thy creatures, and to speak forth Thy praise before all who are in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p>Thou art He, O my Lord, Whose bounty hath surpassed all things, and Whose power hath transcended all things, and Whose mercy hath encompassed all things. Look, then, upon Thy people with the eyes of Thy tender mercies, and leave them not to themselves and to their corrupt desires in Thy days. How farsoever they may have strayed from Thee, and however grievously they have turned back from Thy face, yet Thou, in Thine essence, art the All-Bountiful, and, in Thine inmost spirit, art the Most Merciful. Deal with them according to the unrevealed tokens of Thy bounty and Thy gifts. Thou art, verily, the One to the power of Whose might all things have testified, and to Whose majesty and omnipotence the whole creation hath borne witness.</p>

<p>We have sent down the Bayan and given glad tidings therein to all creation of this Revelation, through whose command the Most Exalted Pen was moved. But when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Promised One appeared, most of the servants turned away from Him. How many a servant arose in hypocrisy and denied God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Among the people, some turned away, some denied, some hesitated, and some unjustly pronounced judgment against Him, whereat the Source of Verses lamented. We came to give life to the world and revealed that which unlocks the treasures, yet the people remain in doubt and dissension. We have endured in the path of God that which pens are powerless to recount. Hold fast to the cord of thy Lord’s loving-kindness and say: I beseech Thee, O my God, to assist me to remain steadfast in this Cause, through which the idols have lamented.</p>

It gives glad-tidings to those who have acknowledged what God acknowledged before the creation of the heavens and the earths - that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Wise. Your letter has come and was presented by the servant who is present before the Wronged One, and We have answered you with that whereby your remembrance shall endure through the eternity of Our most beautiful names. Verily your Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Rejoice in that We have heard your call and what you have praised God with, the Lord of all worlds. We have found from your letter the fragrance of your love and your turning toward this Horizon, from which the servants have turned away save those whom God has willed, the Sovereign of this wondrous Day.

We counseled them that nothing should prevent them from God, the Lord of the worlds, and We informed them of what had been ordained aforetime that they might take heed and be among the discerning ones. Yet when the veil was rent asunder and the All-Bestowing came, they turned away from Him through Whom the heavens and earth were illumined. Thus doth the All-Informed apprise thee.

Among the people are those who turned away from it and took idols as their objects of worship; and among them are those who turned toward it and were caught up by the breezes of grace from a holy and resplendent direction. Deprive not thyself, but take for thyself near the throne a station that is faithful to the truth, lest thou be seized by the casting of intimations from every wretched opponent.

And We were imprisoned with seventy souls of those who had emigrated with God, and among them were a few numbered souls who cast away whatever worldly vanities they possessed, who were not content with separation, and who soared in the atmosphere of longing to a station wherein gold prevented them not from attaining the presence of their Lord, the Chosen One, the Mighty. We beseech God to assist them in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to preserve them all from self and passion, that they may circle round about Him and be moved by His command. Be thou not heedless of the remembrance of thy Lord. Remember Him in spirit and fragrance. He will guard thee from the hosts of Satan.

Nevertheless, it has been observed that a soul was deprived of the King of certitude by a mere fancy, and was forbidden from the ocean of inner meanings by a single word. Would that he had remained distant from but a particle of the Sun of Truth, or had been deprived of but a drop from the Most Great Ocean. Rather, he was observed to be occupied with the bat and bereft of the Sun of meanings. If only the people knew! Would that one possessed of insight had contemplated with the eye of God the verses of Oneness which have been sent down from the heaven of the divine Will. I swear by the Most Great Name, whosoever looketh upon it with his own eye will recognize that it hath no likeness in creation and no peer among the servants. O handmaid of God!

<p>O Mulla Muhammad, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the All-Seeing, the All-Informed. Nothing escapes His knowledge. He witnesses and sees, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He has appeared and made manifest His straight path, and guided all to that which profits them. Among the people are those who have turned towards Him, and among them are those who have turned away, and among them are those who have openly denied God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. He who loves Me has mentioned thee, so We have remembered thee in a perspicuous Tablet which speaks before the faces of the world: “The Kingdom belongs to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.” Blessed is he who has heard and attained. Woe to the heedless! Vain imaginings have prevented those on earth from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of all worlds. They have taken their idle fancies as lords beside God. Verily, they are among the perishing ones. The verses have been sent down and the evidence has appeared, yet most of the people are in evident delusion. Give thanks to God, thy Lord, for having remembered thee and revealed unto thee that whereby the eyes of those endued with understanding are solaced. Praise be to God, thy Lord and the Lord of the mighty throne!</p>

<p>O Siyyid Hashim! He is God! God’s gaze is ever fixed upon His servants, and were He to withdraw that glance of favor from the earth and all who dwell thereon for less than that, all would assuredly return to nothingness. However, in this day it is beloved that the loved ones of God should appear among His servants with spiritual qualities, that from every soul the sweet fragrances of the dwellers of all worlds might be inhaled. Those who claim to love must show proof. Not all that is uttered by the tongue finds acceptance at the threshold of the All-Merciful. Today deeds take precedence over words. Therefore strive that praiseworthy actions may be manifested from all your limbs. If someone claims to be of the divine paradise, that claim alone does not prove it, rather those endowed with spiritual perception must inhale. If they detect the fragrances of the gardens, it will be accepted; otherwise it is rejected. O my brothers! The scratching of the Supreme Pen is far more distinct and excellent than the buzzing of flies.</p>

At times, while bound in chains and fetters, He would beseech the Lord of Creation for comfort and mercy on behalf of His servants, and at other times, while imprisoned by His enemies, He would give all the glad-tidings of the ocean of bounty and the heaven of generosity.

I swear by the Dawning-Place of Revelation, shouldst thou become aware of it, thou wouldst behold thyself in a station that is sanctified, holy and pure from the clouds and conditions and vain imaginings of the world of creation. No tongue is capable of rendering thanks for this station. Therefore thou must arise to that which is befitting and worthy. Thus doth the Beloved of the world make mention of thee, even as He mentioned thee before, and before that. Be thou grateful and say: “Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hearest my call from Thy remote prison!” Convey to all the loved ones the greetings of God. Verily He maketh mention of them in this mighty stronghold.</p>

The rabble of the world have arisen to extinguish the light of the Ancient King, and with utmost striving have endeavored and continue to endeavor to destroy the Cause of God. However, God has manifested the Cause and will manifest that which He has willed, despite every heedless and remote one. The armies of the world and the ranks of nations have not prevented and will not prevent Him from that which He has willed. Blessed are those souls whom the clamor of the heedless did not prevent from the Lord of the Day of Judgment.

O Lord! Thou knowest me better than I know myself, and Thou knowest what is best for me. Through Thy generosity, decree for me that which befitteth Thy majesty and sovereignty.

Praise be to the Object of all creation Who, in this Most Great Day, has enabled you and blessed you with service to His loved ones. Whatsoever has appeared from you for the sake of God and in His path is manifest and visible before His countenance. Praise be to God that you have drunk from the cup of reunion and, through the bounty of the immortal King, have attained unto the shore of the ocean of attainment. You have witnessed that which the eyes of the world were anticipating, and heard that which the ears of those near unto God were yearning to hear. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land - those who have drunk from the cup of steadfastness and are possessed of a single heart. Blessed are those handmaidens whom the clamor of the idolaters did not prevent from the Divine Lote-Tree, and whom the oppression of the tyrannical did not keep back from the love of God. Upon you and upon them be glory, and upon every handmaiden who has held fast to My Strong Cord.</p>

You have borne hardships in the path of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. You arose to serve the Cause in days when the tribes wailed, every silent one cried out, and every mighty trusted one was shaken. Then when the Cause was raised up and the banners were lifted high, the people rose up against it - among them were those who turned away, those who disbelieved, and those who pronounced judgment without any clear proof or evidence. Thank God that He heard your call, O Wronged One, and answered you with this Book, from which those near to God find what every noble king has found. Rejoice in My remembrance, then speak forth My praise in such wise that My enemies who have arisen to harm and afflict Me shall not prevent you.

<p>O Muhammad-Taqi, the Most Great, the Most Great! O Thou Who settest aflame the hearts of lovers! I beseech Thee by the Luminary of the horizons to send down into the hearts of Thy loved ones a tranquility from Thy presence, lest tribulations prevent them from turning to Thee. How sweet, O my God, are Thy tribulations to the taste of them that are near unto Thee from among Thy servants, and how delectable are Thy decrees to the tongues of them that are sincere from among Thy loved ones! By Thy glory! The head of Baha, despite all that hath befallen it through trials, doth not rest upon the pillow, nor doth his body find repose upon the couch. Can the eyes of the lovers taste the sweet slumber of sleep, and can the fire of longing which Thou hast kindled in the heart be quenched? Nay, by Thy Self, O Lord of all existence and King of the Day of Mutual Calling! Blessed, doubly blessed are those servants of Thine through whose tongues Thou callest Thyself and through whom Thou makest mention of Thy sovereignty. By Thy glory! This proceedeth solely from Thy loving-kindness and mercy, Thy bounty and grace, and from their having borne in Thy love what none among Thy creation bore before them. Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

Exalted is the All-Merciful, the Manifestation of this mighty grace! The Ancient Beauty hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison and counseleth thee with that which shall profit thee in all the worlds of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful. Be thou eloquent in His remembrance, steadfast in the service of His Cause, and act according to that which hath been revealed in His perspicuous Book, which, when it was sent down from the Kingdom of utterance, all the books of the world bowed down before it. To this beareth witness the Lord of nations in this glorious station. When thou attainest unto My Tablet and findest the fragrance of Mine utterance, turn thee toward the Most Exalted Horizon and say: O Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below! I beseech Thee by the wrongs suffered by Him Who is the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Dayspring of Thy signs to aid me in that which Thou lovest and approvest.

We have remembered everyone who hath turned towards God, and have counseled every one who hath turned away from His straight Path. We entered into prison and called all to the supreme horizon. Among the people are those who heard and turned towards it, and among them are those who turned away and were numbered with the idolaters. Fear ye God, O peoples of the earth! Reflect upon the Manifestation of God and His Cause, and follow not every ignorant remote one. He maketh mention of you through His grace and draweth you nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

This is a Book sent down in truth from the Wronged One, that it may draw the people near unto God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsisting. O peoples of the earth! Hear the call from the precincts of Akka - verily there is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved. Blessed is the ear that hath attained to hearing it and the eye that hath been honored to behold His verses which hold dominion over all that was and shall be. O Moses! Hear with the ear of the heart what the tongue of the Wronged One speaketh in this praiseworthy station. He mentioneth thee for the sake of God and guideth thee to His manifest and extended path. When thou hast attained unto My verses and drunk the choice wine of revelation from the cup of My bounty, turn thy face toward the Most Great House of God and say: O Lord of the nations and Manifestation of the world! I testify to Thy unity and the sanctity of Thy Being, and to that which Thou hast revealed in Thy Books, Scriptures and Tablets. I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou didst change fear into tranquility and denial into faith, and by the ocean of Thy utterance and the heaven of Thy bounty, to ordain for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and make me steadfast in Thy Cause, such that neither the hosts of the world nor the oppression of the nations shall hold me back. Praise be unto Thee, O my God, and thanks be unto Thee, O my God, for having awakened me when I was asleep, and guided me when I had turned away, and mentioned me when I was silent, and turned toward me from the direction of the Prison when I was hesitant, and taught me when I was ignorant, and made me aware when I was heedless. By Thy might, O Thou Desire of the world! I find no helper for myself except the hosts of Thy wisdom and utterance, no supporter except the wonders of Thy grace, and no protector except Thee. I beseech Thee by Thy Word which, were it to be cast upon the mountain it would soar, and upon the heaven it would be cleft asunder, and upon the earth it would be split, and upon the trees they would bear fruit, and upon the rock it would cry out - to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, firm in Thy service, and speaking in Thy praise. Then ordain for me, O my God, that which will preserve me from all else save Thee and guide me to what Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. Moreover, write down for me that which shall profit me in all the worlds of Thy worlds. Thou art He Whom neither the affairs of the world nor the clamor of the nations can hinder. Thou hast appeared and manifested whatsoever Thou didst desire through Thy power and sovereignty. There is no God but Thee, the Single, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We desire to mention him who was named Muhammad-Sharif, who was mentioned in thy letter, that he may rejoice and be of the thankful ones. O Muhammad-Sharif! At this moment the Most Great Name hath turned toward thee and maketh mention of thee, that it may attract thee to the station of steadfastness and detachment. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Desire of the world and Beloved of the nations, for having remembered me in Thy days and manifested unto me from the treasuries of Thy protection the pearls of Thy wisdom and utterance. I beseech Thee by Thy generosity which hath encompassed existence to make me among those who have spoken in Thy remembrance and praise and who have arisen to serve Thy Cause in Thy lands among Thy servants. Enable me to do that which beseemeth Thy days and befitteth Thy manifestation and power. Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to grant this prayer.\n\n=== END BH02166 ===\n\n=== START BH02167 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who speaketh between earth and heaven! This is an epistle from the All-Bestowing to him who hath believed in God, the Lord of Lords, and attained unto the Most Great Ocean when it surged through this Name which God hath made to prevail over all who are in the lands. We revealed the Bayan for this Revelation through which the worlds were illumined. But when the appointed time came and the Revealer of verses appeared, the people were seized by the doubts of those who denied God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Some doubted His Cause, while others denied this Hour from which all hours have dawned. Say: Is the knowledge of the Hour with you, or with your Lord in His Book? None on earth can comprehend His knowledge - to this testifieth every discerning knower. Say: Every hour hath appeared through His command and every resurrection hath been raised up through His sovereignty which hath encompassed all possibility. Do ye seek through what ye possess to draw near unto this Fire which hath been kindled from the Tree that hath been raised in the most exalted station? By My life! What was revealed in the Bayan sufficeth you not today except through this Revelation, at whose appearance the Cock of the Throne crowed and the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the One, the All-Powerful, the All-Forgiving!\" The Bayan hath informed you of the loftiness of this Revelation - behold, O ye who are endued with insight! He said: \"Beware lest ye be veiled by what is in the Bayan from this Revelation shining forth upon the horizons. Whosoever seeketh to know Me through aught else than what was revealed by Me is indeed the most veiled of all creation before the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Whosoever desireth to behold Me must behold Me through Mine own eyes.\" Thus was the matter decreed in the Tablets. Say: Fear God and make not what ye possess the standard for this Light that hath shone forth from the horizon of certitude. Every measure hath appeared through His command, and through Him the Path hath appeared and the Balance been set up. None may test the Lord - rather doth He test whom He willeth through His sovereignty. He is indeed the All-Powerful, the All-Choosing. Were anyone to read what was revealed in the Bayan, he would surely weep at what hath befallen the Wronged One from the daysprings of darkness. O Karim! Thy letter hath come before the All-Bountiful, and We have answered thee with this Tablet from which the Light of the Cause hath shone forth with power and sovereignty. Give thanks unto God for having sent unto thee in every year the proof and testimony of God, and for having mentioned thy name while He was in the hands of the wicked. Grieve not at the hardships of the world - greater ones have befallen Us. Be patient even as thy Lord was patient. He is indeed the Mighty, the All-Patient. Arise to serve Him amongst the people - this beseemeth thee and those who have turned unto the Qiblih of humanity. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the mention of thy Lord and for having voiced His praise amongst the servants. The glory be upon thee and upon those with thee who have stood firm in the Cause and fulfilled the Covenant. Then remember thy family from the Wronged One. Say: Remember when thou wert in the house before thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing, and heard His sweetest call as the breezes of revelation wafted from behind the veil. Thus did We bestow Our favor upon thee when the Luminary of the horizons was in Iraq.\n\n=== END BH02167 ===\n\n=== START BH02168 ===\n\nHe is God, the Most Holy, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Exalted\n\nThis is a Book that speaketh the truth, that there is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.

Fear ye God and oppose not Him Who hath appeared with the truth by a manifest command. Say: The Youth desireth naught for Himself, but rather desireth for you that which God hath desired, did ye but know. Know ye that His will is the very Will of God, could ye but understand. He is indeed the One Who hath arisen in pure servitude unto God, your Lord, could ye but perceive. He loveth naught but servitude unto the True God, and unto this testifieth all things, even should ye deny it.\n\nSay: He is the One Who hath called upon God in every tongue, yet ye comprehend not. Every mention that hath ascended unto God, in whatsoever tongue, hath appeared from His tongue, and this is a truth well-known. Every face that hath turned toward the Beloved of earth and heaven hath turned only through the turning of this imprisoned Servant. Say: He was prostrate before God ere the creation of the heavens and earth, and ere the pearls of divine knowledge emerged from the shells of hearts. Say: He fell prostrate with his face upon a spot of earth in submission unto God, Lord of what was and what shall be.\n\nSay: O people! Fear ye God, deny Him not, and follow not every rejected ignorant one. Whensoever this Dove warbled upon the twigs of the Divine Lote-Tree in remembrance of His Most Exalted Self, this was only after God's command, your Lord, would ye but be certain. The Beloved of Baha hath previously informed you that He Who would come after Him with the name of the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, would proclaim in all things: \"I am God, there is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.\" And as I was beholding the direction of His Cause, there was revealed in this Manifestation that which hath caused every witness and the witnessed to tremble. By the life of the Beloved! Were I not beholding His wisdom, I would not have mentioned Myself save in pure servitude, for this is the desire of My heart, and unto this testify My spirit, My soul and My being, could ye but understand.\n\nO servant! Worship thy Lord, then prostrate thyself before Him, and be not of those who disdain. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not those who mock at the signs of God. Soar upon two wings of detachment unto this atmosphere wherein hath been raised the mention of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Beware lest anything prevent thee from turning toward thy Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Remember Him at all times, and He shall suffice thee against those who have disbelieved in God, mocked His Messengers, and were of the despairing ones. Thus have We counseled thee in truth, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto those who have shattered the idols and were of the detached ones.

Verily, there is no God but Him, and He Who hath appeared with the truth - neither doth the decree prevent Him from making mention of the Lord of Names, nor do the veils of them who have disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the Great, conceal Him from that which He desireth.\n\nKnow thou, O servant, that thy letter hath come before Us, and We have taken it with the hand of loving-kindness, and the glances of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, have been directed towards it. We have become acquainted with its contents and have ordained for thee in the Tablet a station which, wert thou to behold it, would cause thee to prostrate thyself and say: \"Praise be unto God, the Lord of the worlds!\" We have recorded for thee the reward of one who hath attained unto the presence of God, and We shall fulfill that which We have purposed for thee. Verily, thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nGive thanks unto thy Lord for having sent down unto thee from the heaven of grace this gleaming, this luminous Tablet. Be thou assured of thy Lord's favor in all conditions and arise to aid His Cause amidst the heavens and the earths. Beware lest the cawing of them who have disbelieved in God should deter thee, or the veils of them who have turned away from the Face after it hath shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's will with manifest sovereignty should hinder thee. He, verily, aideth him who ariseth to serve His Cause and calleth the people unto Him. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from all else save Him and hath turned with his heart unto that which he hath been commanded by One Who is Mighty, All-Knowing.\n\nKnow thou, moreover, that We cast upon him who hath wronged a word from Our presence. He turned away therefrom; soon shall We make him a lesson unto all peoples. We sent one of Our servants, attired him in the raiment of detachment, adorned him with the ornament of strength and certitude, and dispatched him unto him with a manifest book. We delivered unto him the messages of his Lord that he might take heed and fear. Verily, thy Lord is He Who judgeth as He pleaseth; the might of the oppressors hindereth Him not. Thus have We informed thee that thou mayest become aware of that which hath been ordained by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nWe had indeed sent aforetime unto Our servant, the Imam, a Tablet that gladdeneth the eyes of the sincere ones. Blessed art thou and he for having attained unto that which most of the servants who claim faith within themselves have failed to attain. When the All-Merciful came with the kingdom of utterance, they denied Him. The curse of God be upon them that have wronged and were among the mischief-makers.\n\nThis is not the day of patience save in My remembrance, the Mighty, the Wondrous. It behooveth you both to arise at all times to make mention of Me and to aid My Cause in such wise that the might of the oppressors shall not deter you. Remind those who believed before of thy Lord, then clothe them with the garments of glorification and utterance from the tongue of their Lord, the All-Merciful. This, verily, is a great favor. Beware lest thou overstep the bounds of wisdom wherewith We have commanded Our servants from thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Soon shall there be sent down unto thee from the heaven of divine decree that which hath been ordained by thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

This is the Most Holy Tablet which God has made its station to be the station of the Point, just as from the Point all letters and words were differentiated, and likewise from this Tablet has been differentiated what was sent down from the beginning that has no beginning and will be differentiated unto the end that has no end. Say: Though it be motionless in its place, yet through it all contingent things were set in motion and appeared from nothingness in the garments of existence. Glorified be God, the Sovereign of the powerful ones! Say: The Essence of Pre-existence has appeared with the truth - exalted be God, the Educator of both worlds and the Lord of all the worlds. And thou, O servant, hearken unto the call of God from the Lote Tree of the Heart which hath been illumined in a translucent, radiant breast. Then know that the Announcement which was before all before hath been differentiated from this Most Great Announcement, and the Command which had proceeded from the most ancient origin hath shone forth from this Most Ancient, Most Upright Ornament. Say: O people of the earth, by God, one Tablet from the traces of God is better than the kingdom of the first and the last ones - nay, I seek forgiveness from God for this, for by one letter thereof were all these created, were ye of those who perceive. And one letter thereof is sweeter than what hath appeared through the Pen and flowed from the tongue and been uttered behind the holy veils by the glorifying concourse. Thus hath this Bird been seized by the raptures of longing on this Night which prideth itself above the bright dawn and every radiant morn, such that there floweth from His Pen that which His will had not preceded, and before which the mountain of the mystics who look not toward the Most Exalted Horizon and who were among those gazing through veils and allusions would crumble. Purify, O people, your ears from all that ye have heard or known, and sanctify your hearts from all that hath been imprinted therein and thereon from mortal images, that there might be imprinted thereon the beauty of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted, the Great, the Ancient. O people of the depths of Paradise! If ye desire to read this luminous, eternal leaf, then first perform ablutions with the water of Tasnim which floweth from the right hand of the Throne, then wash therewith your outer and inner selves that ye might hear how the Dove of the All-Merciful warbleth in this Garden with wondrous, unprecedented melodies. Without this ye shall never find its hidden delights nor recognize the jewels of His wisdom that are treasured therein, even should ye read it all the days of your life, morning and evening, or at every moment. Thus doth the Dove warble in this atmosphere which God hath made sanctified from the faces of the polytheists, whose air is pure, whose breezes are sweet, whose fragrance is perfumed, and whose musk is diffused. Therefore seek it out, O ye who are brought nigh! Thus doth God bestow His eternal, everlasting, single, heavenly favors upon the worlds. And ye, O Concourse of the highest heaven and O assemblage of humanity in the earthly realm, deprive not yourselves therefrom and deny it not. Fear God with true fear and be not of the heedless ones. Blessed is he who is sustained thereby and therefrom without turning to the peoples of the heavens and earth.

Say: O concourse of earth! Hearken unto the Call that hath been raised from the direction of Akka, as a token of God's grace, the Lord of Lords. The treasures have appeared and the mysteries have emerged, inasmuch as He Who conversed on Sinai hath seated Himself upon the throne of Revelation in a spot which God hath made the Dayspring of Light and the Dawning-place of His signs. Say: O concourse of earth! Deprive not yourselves of this bounty, at whose appearance the Herald proclaimed: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Creator of creation. Say: O heedless ones! Fear God and follow not those who have denied God's proof and evidence and disbelieved in His signs. Thus have We sent down the Command and revealed that which lay hidden in God's knowledge, the Revealer of laws.\n\nIn the Persian tongue, hearken to the divine call. This call is the spirit of life for the people of the world and the greatest healing medicine for all nations. Whoso truly attaineth unto it is reckoned among those near to God and is inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen. Blessed is the one who hath arisen to serve and hath become aware of the station of religions recorded in the books of old and new. That which thou didst compose and recite hath reached the Wronged One, and from it We perceived the fragrance of thy love, thy mention and thy praise of God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed be thy tongue - We testify that it hath spoken the truth and attained to the remembrance of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. O thou who gazest upon the countenance! The power of sight was created for beholding, and the power of hearing was brought from non-existence into being to hearken unto this call raised from the Supreme Horizon. Praise be to God that through divine confirmation thou art occupied in this spiritual springtime with the mention and praise of the Goal of the world's desire. One bounty is thy being confirmed in remembrance and praise, and another bounty is thy being accepted and illumined with the light of His good-pleasure. By My life! The treasures of the world cannot be compared with this blessed word that hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of will. Say: Praise be to Thee, O Goal of the worlds, and thanks be to Thee, O Beloved of those in the heavens and on earth! Say: My God, my God! I testify to Thy grace, Thy bounty and Thy generosity, and I acknowledge Thy sovereignty that hath encompassed Thy dominion, and the letter B whereby Thou didst bring forth existence from non-existence, and the letter H whereby the limbs of the nations who broke Thy Covenant and Testament trembled, and who acted in ways that caused the dwellers of the cities of Thy names and attributes to lament. I beseech Thee, O Possessor of existence and Lord of the seen and unseen, to make me one of those whom neither the world, nor its might, nor its weapons and artillery have prevented from drawing nigh unto Thee and turning toward the lights of Thy countenance. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast sent down in Thy Books for Thy chosen ones, then open before my face the doors of Thy blessing and bounty.

Thy letter hath attained unto the Most Exalted Horizon and toward it hath turned the gaze of thy Lord, the Most High, the All-Glorious. Through its presence before the Throne, God hath absolved thee of thy misdeeds. He, verily, is the Bestower, the Munificent, the Forgiving, the Generous. He hath read what thou didst compose in praise of thy Lord. All things were created for this purpose, yet most of the people are heedless. The Herald of the All-Merciful calleth out to them at all times, saying: \"This is the Pure Kawthar! Draw nigh, O people of zeal, and be not of the doubters!\" And My Most Exalted Pen proclaimeth: \"O concourse of creation! The Lord of Names hath come! Turn ye unto Him and be not of them that are far removed.\" Yet they slumber upon the couch of heedlessness and idle fancies, such that this Call which hath encompassed the world moveth them not - the Call whereby the very rocks cry out: \"The Kingdom is God's, the Almighty, the Most High, the Most Great!\" Say: This is a Day wherein if anyone should miss what behooveth him, he shall not be able to make good his loss, though he should run through the wilderness or plunge into the seas of names. To this beareth witness the Lord of all beings, while imprisoned in this mighty stronghold. Were the people to know the worth of these days and what hath appeared therein, they would cast away the earth and all that is thereon, turning toward the Qiblih which God hath made the point of adoration for the denizens of the Supreme Concourse, the dwellers of the cities of eternity, and the angels drawn nigh. Give thanks unto God for having attained unto the recognition of the Dawning-Place of His sovereignty, the Manifestation of His Revelation, and the Dayspring of His Most Great Name. Thou hast been mentioned before the Throne, and this Tablet hath been revealed unto thee, from which the sweet savors of loving-kindness and the fragrances that cause the hearts of the sincere to soar have been wafted. Thereupon the Tongue of Grandeur addresseth His Most Exalted Pen from this Ultimate Tree, saying: Make mention of thy loved ones whose petitions have not been presented before the Throne, that thy most sweet call may draw them to a station that cannot be described by mention or utterance, and may cause them to voice thy praise amongst the worlds. O Faran! Thou art beneath the glances of the mercy of thy Lord, and from thee We perceive the sweet savors of My remembrance, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Blessed are My people within thee who remember Me with joy and fragrance and among whom the perfume of My luminous and cherished garment is diffused. O My loved ones! We are with you and hear your call, and We have heard what your tongues have uttered in My remembrance, and We shall show you what ye are engaged in during the days of your Lord, the Mighty, the Peerless. Unto each one of you hath been sent down that which none can reckon save God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. We beseech God to aid you in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to strengthen you in that which beseemeth His Cause, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. Soon shall the wrongdoers behold the recompense of what they have wrought in this vain life, and the sincere shall see what hath been ordained for them in the Kingdom of their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Thus hath the Tongue of Revelation spoken in remembrance of His loved ones on this night wherein the horizon of inspiration hath shone forth from the Luminary of His Name, which God hath made the Sovereign of Names for all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\n=== END BH02172 ===\n\n=== START BH02173 ===\n\nHE IS THE HEARER, THE ANSWERER\n\nO My Name!

From some wafts the fragrance of joy and gladness, while from others grief, sorrow and distress are evident, for mention is made therein of the oppression of the loved ones of God, and likewise the tribulations of the friends. Say: Be not grieved. By the life of God! For each one, according to their station and rank, the Most Great Joy hath been ordained. In one of the Tablets this exalted Word was revealed from the Supreme Pen: \"Had the world any worth in the sight of thy Lord, thou wouldst have seen Me taking its reins and seated upon its thrones. Where are the Caesars and their palaces? Where are the Pharaohs and their hosts? Where are the tyrants and their towers? God hath brought them down from their palaces to their tombs. Take ye warning, O people of insight!\" Although outward tribulations are a cause of sorrow and grief, yet in view of the all-encompassing mercy and supreme loving-kindness ordained for each one, there is mercy upon mercy, bounty upon bounty, and joy upon joy.\n\nLikewise, the letters sent by thee have arrived, including the letter of Haydar-Qabli-'Ali, upon him be My glory, which this servant read in the presence of the Countenance. O My Name! Their error is not known, but in each letter repentance, return and seeking forgiveness are mentioned and recorded. Say: O Haydar-Qabli-'Ali! Thou art beneath the glances of thy Lord's holy and bountiful favor. Grieve not over anything. In all matters place thy trust in Him. Verily, He is with whomsoever desireth Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Fix thy gaze upon the horizon of wisdom, hold fast unto it and cling to its hem. Thus hath the All-Merciful revealed in the Scriptures and Tablets. To hold fast to wisdom is obligatory and essential, and likewise consultation, but in some matters consultation becomes a cause of notoriety, and this is contrary to wisdom and the protection of certain souls.\n\nO My Name! They have made mention of the villages round about and have expressed satisfaction. Blessed are those souls who have attained in this day. Ephemeral things did not prevent them from the immortal Kingdom, nor did the river of names deprive them from the ocean of meanings. All the souls mentioned have attained to the grace of God. Give him the glad tidings from Me that he hath succeeded in serving My firm and mighty Cause. It behooveth him to thank God night and day for this precious and wondrous bounty.\n\nThe letter of 'A??ar, upon him be My glory, was presented by this servant before the Face of the Wronged One. Praise be to God, they are engaged in mention and praise and are standing firm in service. We beseech God for assistance and ask for confirmation. He and his relatives have been and are mentioned in the presence of the Countenance. We have revealed for them that which will make them independent of the mention of every knowing one who maketh mention. Give them glad tidings from Me and convey My greetings to their faces from thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\n\\[At the end of the text the phrase \"Letter of My handmaiden\" is written.

The realm of sanctification and detachment, which is adorned with wisdom, has been and ever shall be most exalted, most beloved, most excellent and most manifest for the elevation of the Word of God and the advancement of existence. Fear of God is a mighty host before which nothing can stand firm. Yet for your honor, trust and resignation have ever been and continue to be recorded by the Supreme Pen. Praise be to God that from the beginning of the Cause you have held fast to that which exalteth the station of the Cause. This is the testimony of the Wronged One concerning your honor. Indeed, at all times whatsoever conduceth to the guidance of the servants is beloved in the sight of God. However, since your honor has now somewhat advanced in age, matters that cause hardship are not permitted except within bearable limits, that the tongues of the gloaters and the deniers may be silenced and the Cause of God, the Lord of the worlds, may be exalted thereby. But We conclude this matter with these words - and that is the contentment of the people. We have mentioned it and continue to mention it as a favor from Us, and We make mention of Hubbu'llah who was remembered in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God to exalt him through His Name amongst His servants. And We make mention of Aqa Buzurg, whom We mentioned before with words from which wafted the fragrance of loving-kindness and favor. Convey to him My greetings, and to those around you. Thus hath the Pen spoken in this mighty prison.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about Hubbu'llah, upon him be the glory of God - if your honor would personally undertake this matter, it would be closer to godliness and acceptable in God's sight. God willing, when it appears and is received, We shall send what behooveth that which We have commanded the servants in My mighty Book. In all conditions your honor must hold fast to that which causeth the exaltation and elevation of God's Cause. If outward commerce has been disrupted, it mattereth not, for today all must engage in that commerce which illumineth the world and elevateth the peoples. True and spiritual commerce taketh precedence over all else, and that commerce hath ever been exalted stations in the sight of God, the Lord of the mighty throne.\n\nConvey greetings from the Wronged One to the honored partner. Say: Be not grieved at outward loss, for ere long thou shalt behold the profit of thy deeds as a treasure preserved with God, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nO Jamal! We desired to make mention of Mahmud Kh-A and console him in what hath befallen him, and comfort him regarding God's irrevocable decree. Verily, he who hath ascended unto God is in the Most Glorious Horizon - to this doth the Tongue of Bounty bear witness in this exalted station. Remember him and his sister from the Wronged One and give them glad tidings of My acceptance and loving-kindness and what hath appeared for them from this luminous Dawning-Place. We beseech God to send down upon him who hath ascended, at all times, mercy from His presence, and upon them both bounty from His side. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Almighty, the Powerful.

O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! Reflect upon the baseness of the people of the Bayan. They have witnessed with their own eyes how the people of the Furqan, namely the Shi'ih sect, throughout ages and centuries, occupied themselves upon pulpits and in homes with mention of Imamate, succession, and titles such as chief and noble and the like, clinging passionately to names while remaining heedless and veiled from their Creator and Manifestation. Each day they appeared with some fancy and clung to some notion, and from their conflicting views different sects emerged, each sect cursing the other, yet they considered themselves the most learned and excellent among all peoples. However, when the divine Balance appeared and the Straight Path was made manifest, all, both learned and ignorant, stumbled in the early years and were consigned to hell-fire. The One Whose presence they had implored with humility and supplication - when He appeared they cursed Him from their pulpits and ultimately issued the decree for His death. And now all the renowned divines have turned away from the Truth and cling to vain imaginings. Nevertheless, the people of the Bayan are again occupied with forming such a sect. It is incumbent and obligatory upon you and the loved ones to protect the helpless servants from previous vain imaginings. This Day is God's Day, wherein none but He should be mentioned. Blessed art thou, in that the Most Exalted Pen hath moved to make mention of thee. Say: O people! By God's life! Until ye pass beyond the river of names, ye shall not attain to the ocean of inner meanings. Have mercy upon yourselves and soil not yourselves with the dust of vain imaginings like the previous sect. Time and again have these words flowed from the Pen of divine decree that perchance ye might become aware. The ignorant Dawlat-Abadi hath raised the standard of leadership although he neither was nor is aware of the fundamental truth of the Cause. He hath become a leader of the people through vain imaginings, conjectures and names of the past. He is among those of whom it is said: \"They changed God's favor into blasphemy and caused their people to dwell in the abode of perdition.\" It is not known what he hath understood from this Most Great Manifestation. Perdition and ruin be upon him! Verily, he and his followers worship vain imaginings and perceive it not. By God's life! They have taken their own conjectures as lords beside God yet they understand not. They have cast aside Him Who speaketh the truth before all the world and have taken those who have denied God, the Lord of the seen and unseen. Blessed art thou for having heard, turned unto God and attained unto that which was recorded in the Book of God, the Lord of all dominion. Remind the people of thy Lord's verses and give them the glad tidings of this Remembrance through which hearts and minds were attracted when it appeared. We beseech Him to open before thy face the doors of grace and favor and to strengthen thee in that which shall cause thy name and mention to endure through the eternity of His names and attributes.

Blessed is the servant who hath today cast away what the people possess and taken what hath been sent down from the presence of One manifest and knowing. O Haji Aqa! Thy deed hath gained the honor of acceptance and there hath been sent down for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This is a Day wherein the Today speaketh, while the people are in manifest drunkenness. Vain imaginings have withheld them from God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: Fear God, O people! Follow Him Who hath come to you with that which profiteth you, and follow not the ways of the ignorant ones who have cast the Book of God behind their backs and committed that which hath caused every discerning soul to lament. This is a Day wherein the door of attainment hath been opened - approach with radiant faces and be not of them that hesitate. When thou hearest the call from this white leaf, say: O God of Names and Creator of heaven! Praise be unto Thee for having mentioned me when sorrows surrounded Thee from those who exchanged trustworthiness for treachery, truthfulness for falsehood, justice for tyranny, and fairness for oppression in Thy days, and who wrought that whereby the Great Terror appeared. O my Lord! Thou knowest and seest that the Wronged One desired for them naught save that which would draw them nigh unto Thee and move them through Thy will and purpose, yet they cast aside Thy command and what Thou didst desire for them through Thy bounty and generosity, clinging to their own desires without Thy good-pleasure. I beseech Thee, O Possessor of the Kingdom of Names, by Thy Most Great Name, the Most Mighty, Most Generous, Most Exalted, Most Glorious, to assist them to return to the court of Thy mercy and the precincts of Thy might and forgiveness. O my Lord! They are Thy servants and Thy creation. The world and its ornaments have deluded them, and its riches and favors have occupied them. I beseech Thee to adorn them with the ornament of justice and fairness. Within Thy grasp is the reins of glory and greatness and favors. There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Dominant, the Powerful.\n\nAt this time We make mention of him who was named Abdul-Husayn, who broke not God's Covenant and Testament, who hesitated not in His Cause, and who chose not silence when His call was raised. The hands of power aided him until he arose before the throne of His manifestation, heard His call, and attained that which most of His creation were deprived of. We beseech Him, exalted be He, not to disappoint him of any good that He hath sent down in His Book. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Kind, the Generous.\n\nWe desired to make mention of him who was named Ali-Akbar \\[that he may thank God, the Lord of\\] the exalted Throne. He is among those who attained in the earliest days to the lights of recognition. He turned, heard, responded, and drank the wine of nearness from the hands of the bounty of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Blessed art thou for having attained unto the mention of the Wronged One time and again. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for thee that which will assist thee to perform a deed that will endure as long as His names and attributes endure.

He is the One Who hath summoned all unto God - among the people some have turned towards Him and others have turned away. Verily thy Lord is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The signs of every learned one have not hindered Him, nor hath the might of any heedless one weakened Him. He hath spoken and continueth to speak that which He hath been commanded by God, the Mighty, the Loving. Reflect upon the people and their deeds. Say: Come ye! By what proof did ye believe in your Most Exalted Lord, and by what cause did ye turn away from this Revelation, at whose appearance the Supreme Pen proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen!\" Say: Have ye not witnessed God's proof and His testimony? Have ye not heard His verses that have encompassed existence? Say: O people! Be fair for God's sake and speak with pure truth - who is it that standeth amidst enemies proclaiming with the most exalted call between earth and heaven? And who is it that hath borne hardships in days when the limbs of the mighty trembled before the might of those who were heedless of God, the Sovereign of Kings?\n\nO Sulayman!

He who recognizeth the evanescence of the world and all therein turneth not unto it, and he who witnesseth its changeability and transience reposeth not his trust in it. God is My witness that I speak for His sake alone, that in these divine days none may remain deprived. Purify thine ear from the sayings of the people of earth that thou mayest attain to hearing the divine Word, and turn thine eye away from the varied colors of the world that thou mayest attain to the presence of the Eternal Lord. Accept not every speaker's word and be not assured by every doer's deed. Many a deed whose source is desire, and many a word whose purpose is to lead astray. God willing, thou shalt attain to true discernment, that thou mayest distinguish the sweetness of the Salsabil of utterance from aught else, and differentiate between the seeker of guidance and the croaker of passion. We beseech God to aid all to perform pure and holy deeds and to manifest praiseworthy character. In every matter reflect and observe with fairness. Then shall appear unto thee what thy Lord, the Lord of the heavens and earth, hath purposed. To this testifieth every one who hath attained to My sealed wine on this blessed and manifest Day. Arise in the name of Truth, rend asunder all veils and coverings, and say: O people! I have cast away what was with me and taken what I was commanded by One mighty and powerful.

This sealed nectar hath not been and is not the portion of those who dwell in fancy and idle imaginings. The wine of certitude hath been and is reserved for those who are sincere and detached. Whosoever in this day is born of the Word and attaineth unto the new life - he is worthy of this station, and all others are forbidden and deprived. This is a testimony that hath in this hour flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Say: O people of the earth! Withhold not yourselves from a single drop of the Most Great Ocean, and deprive not yourselves of a leaf from the Divine Tree.\n\nO Sulayman! Verily I say! No one hath apprehended the root of this Cause. It is incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to perceive with the eye of God, and to hearken with His ear. Whoso beholdeth Me with an eye besides Mine own will never be able to know Me. None among the Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely apprehended the nature of this Revelation. Today the All-Encompassing Ocean is manifest and the Sun of Truth is shining. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath shattered the idols of vain imaginings with the power of certitude, who hath detached himself from all else save God, the Lord of the worlds, who hath adorned his head with the crown of detachment and his temple with the ornament of steadfastness, and his heart with the light of the knowledge of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne.\n\nThy letter hath come before the Wronged One, sent by him who was named Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin in the Crimson Book. From My Most Exalted Pen I have answered thee with that which hath made the limbs of the divines of Persia to quake - they who have taken their vain imaginings as lords besides God and pronounced judgment against Him through Whom the sun hath shone forth and the horizons have been illumined. Thus have their souls enticed them. They are indeed of the perfidious in the sight of God, the Lord of the Day of Mutual Meeting.\n\nO Sulayman! Dedicate thy days to the service of God.

I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love in such wise that neither the clamor of the people nor the might of the aggressive ones may keep me back from Thee. O Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaiden. I have turned unto Thee, detached from all else but Thee. I beseech Thee by the Hour and its signs, and by the Resurrection and what hath appeared therein, to ordain for me the recompense of one who hath sought Thy presence, appeared before the gate of Thy grandeur, heard Thy call, and found the fragrance of Thy verses, the breezes of Thy revelation and the sweet-scented winds of Thine inspiration. Then ordain for me through Thy bounty and grace the good of all Thy worlds. O Lord! Assist me with the hosts of wisdom and utterance that I may mention Thy servants and bring them nigh unto Thee.

Hasten unto Him, then choose for yourselves a path unto Him. Strive in God with the true striving through the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Thus has the All-Merciful spoken in this station which has been raised up in His name.\n\nThe smoke of corruption has encompassed all regions such that naught can be seen but armies and naught can be heard but the clash of swords. Thus has the matter been decreed through what the hands of those who were far from the truth have wrought.\n\nSay: Fear God, O people, and speak not what the people before you spoke, and follow not those who committed that which caused the Sovereign of existence to lament. He Who is established upon the throne of utterance bears witness to this with an authority that was manifest through the truth.\n\nBehold and remember what the people of the Furqan committed when the All-Merciful came with a Cause that encompassed all the worlds. They denied Him in Whom they had believed, broke God's covenant and His pledge, and did that which caused the Holy Spirit to lament. He Who came with the truth to guide the servants to a path that was straight through justice bears witness to this.\n\nBlessed is thy father who testified to that which God testified and acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered. We bear witness that he is of the people of Baha and has been mentioned with glory by the Supreme Pen.\n\nWhen thou art attracted by My verses and the rapture of My call takes hold of thee, say: \"My God, my God!

Verily Thou art the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the Wise.\"\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! Reflect upon the heedlessness of the people. They have abandoned the Truth and turned away from the lights of the Luminary of certitude, clinging instead to Hadi of Dawlat-Abad. Such is the condition of the manifestations of vain imaginings. Although he had no knowledge whatsoever of this Cause, yet he walks blindly and the sightless ones of the world have obeyed and continue to obey him, just as they did before, as thou hast heard and now witnessest. From the beginning of the Cause the Supreme Pen has proclaimed in its loudest voice that which would guide the servants. Whosoever wishes, let him believe, and whosoever wishes, let him turn away. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. Thus have We expounded the verses and sent them unto thee that thine eyes may be consoled thereby, and the eyes of those whom the veils of the world and what is possessed by the nations have not prevented. They have witnessed and said: \"Praise be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Goal of the worlds! And glory be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Object of worship of those who are in the heavens and on the earth!\"\n\n=== END BH02179 ===\n\n=== START BH02180 ===\n\nO Muhammad! Upon thee be My glory and loving-kindness. In these days an eye ailment has appeared, and therefore the Pen has paused in mentioning the friends. His Holiness the Branch Diya'u'llah has repeatedly made mention of you and the travelers, and has beseeched a special mention from the divine Kingdom of utterance. The tongue speaks and the heart bears witness that the friends have ever been and are remembered. We beseech God to give them to drink from the Kawthar of His utterance from the hand of His bounty - a Kawthar that brings joy and dispels grief. My God, My God! Thou didst plant the saplings of existence with the hand of Thy bounty and watered them with the rain of Thy mercy until they attained the station \"Blessed be God, the best of creators.\" We hope that the fruits of steadfastness, joy, submission and contentment will appear from these trees. Some time ago these exalted words were revealed and manifested from the Dawning-place of Divine revelation and the Dayspring of the All-Merciful's utterance: O peerless Friend and incomparable Beloved! The blessed trees are surrounded by heedless axe-wielders on one side and shameless cleaver-bearers on the other. No helper is seen who has power to help save Thy grace, generosity and mercy. We testify that they desired naught but that from which the fragrance of Thy good-pleasure wafted, and turned to none but the direction of Thy loving-kindness and power. I beseech Thee to protect them from the evil of the oppressors among Thy servants and the transgressors among Thy creation. We convey greetings to each one and have mentioned and continue to mention them. Truly I say that what has appeared is the cause of the exaltation of the Word and the upliftment of the Cause. That honored one and all know that this community holds fast to righteousness and piety and is severed from oppression and corruption. The hope of their hearts has been and is the comfort and freedom of the people. The Supreme Pen has in the nights and days counseled all and commanded them to that which is the cause and means of deliverance. Soon the hand of divine justice will manifest that which is the cause of awakening. Now slumber of heedlessness has seized all. Soon they shall find themselves in evident abasement and painful chastisement. In these days there has been a pause in sending Tablets, for the oppressors of the world are intent on seizing them. Be patient as We have been patient until God brings about His decree. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty. Mention each of the travelers on behalf of the Wronged One. Say: Be not grieved at anything. Rejoice in what has appeared and manifested that which was hidden and treasured in God's knowledge, the Lord of the worlds. Today the countenance of existence smiles through the appearance of Him Who conversed on Sinai. All must attain supreme joy, for the lovers of the horizons have aimed at the place of sacrifice and dawned from the horizon of detachment. Now of the mentioned accounts, some are true and some are otherwise.

Behold those who laid claim to knowledge: when the door of heaven was opened and He Who originated it came, they denied Him and followed their own imaginings. Say: O concourse of divines! Fear ye God and be fair in His Cause. By what proof did ye believe in God's Messengers of old, and by what evidence did ye turn away from Him Who speaketh betwixt earth and heaven? Bring forth what ye possess, if ye be possessed of knowledge. Say: Fear ye God and follow not your desires. Abandon vain imaginings and turn ye towards the supreme horizon that ye may find the Sun of Certitude shining therefrom with this Name whereby the back of idle fancy was broken and the beauty of unity hath dawned from this praiseworthy station. Beware lest ye speak of what ye possess.

Arise to promote the Cause by God's leave and permission, then aid it through remembrance and utterance. This is what thou hast been commanded in this Hidden Tablet. Be as the morning breeze unto the cities and villages that their inhabitants may be awakened thereby, or as the spring winds unto both noble and lowly. Convey the Cause with wisdom that those seized by the stupor of heedlessness may be awakened thereby and turn unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Rise from the horizon of certitude with remembrance and utterance that the hearts of those who slumber may be attracted thereby.\n\nWe have inhaled the fragrance of thy love and turning unto Us, and We have turned toward thee from this remote prison and make mention of thee in truth that there may appear through thee that which befitteth this wondrous Day. Say: O peoples of the earth! Whither do ye flee this Day? None can find refuge save in him who hath laid hold on the Most Firm Handle and turned unto God, the Lord of Names, with an illumined heart. Beware lest the affairs of creation sadden thee. By My life! They shall pass away, and there shall endure for thee what hath been ordained in a preserved tablet. Stand firm in the Cause through God's power and might. He will assist thee through His sovereignty and aid thee in all conditions.

We make mention of her at this time that it may be a glory and honor and treasure for her with God, the Lord of the worlds. The mention shining forth from the horizon of the Kingdom and the light blazing from the horizon of the heaven of might be upon thee, O my handmaiden and my leaf, who speaketh My praise and turneth toward My horizon and soareth in My atmosphere and holdeth fast to My cord and cleaveth to the hem of My tender mercy and loving-kindness. Thou art she who turned to the Most Exalted Horizon when the Creator of the heavens came with the Kingdom of Names, and who hearkened when the Most Exalted Pen raised its shrill voice, and who hastened to the ocean of knowledge when the concourse of divines and princes held back. Blessed art thou, O Mother of My near ones and she who showeth compassion to My chosen ones. I testify that thy heart was the dawning-place of the love of God and thy tongue the source of His remembrance and thy breast His vista. Blessed is the handmaiden who turned to thee and mentioned that which was sent down from the heaven of thy Lord's will, the All-Merciful, when thou didst ascend to the Most Exalted Companion and didst dwell in the vicinity of thy Lord's mercy, the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the Last and the First. Blessed is the earth that was honored by thy body and attained thy presence. I testify that thou didst believe in God when most of the servants denied Him, and didst drink of My choice-sealed wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name when most of the people of the lands were debarred from it. Thou art she whom the clamor did not prevent and whom hatred did not veil. Thou didst speak the praise of thy Lord until thy spirit ascended to a station none knoweth save God, the Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens. During thy life thou wert in a house wherein was raised the remembrance of God, the Goal of all desire and Lord of the Throne on high and of the earth below. Thou art she who attained the verses of thy Lord before thy ascension and after it. Mercy preceded thee and grace encompassed thee and light moved before thy face, and at thy ascension a company of angels and the Spirit welcomed thee. The Mother of the Book with Him beareth witness to this. The glory be upon thee and upon thy beginning and thy end and thy outward and thy inward self, and the mercy of God and His tender care. My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the hearts that were rent asunder in Thy path and melted in separation from Thee, and by the bodies that soared in Thy love, and by the faces that turned toward Thy face, and by the breathings of Thy revelation in Thy days and the manifestations of Thy power in Thy Kingdom and Thy might, to ordain for the one who hath visited Thy handmaiden, by Thy Most Exalted Pen, the good of the Last and of the First. Then forgive him, O my God, through Thy grace and bounty, and purify him, O my Goal, from disobedience, by Thy Name, the All-Merciful. Thou art He through Whose Name, the All-Forgiving, the ocean of forgiveness surgeth in contingent being, and through Whose Name, the All-Bountiful, the sun of bounty shineth forth from the horizon of the world. I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy face to forgive Thy servants and remit their misdeeds and sins. Then accept from them, O my God, what they have wrought in Thy days and performed in service to Thy near ones and chosen ones.

Divine decree confirmeth that which God's Will and Command hath ordained. The ledger of the world testifieth to His irrevocable decree. The palace of Chosroes which was the seat of the King of Kings is now the dwelling place of owls and spiders. Take heed, O ye who are endowed with insight! How many souls dwelt in palaces at dawn only to return to the grave at night! Yet graves are the treasuries of existence and tokens of divine bounty. Divine decree is beloved by the wise, and all are content with it, nay rather thankful. The complainant is not and hath never been acceptable. \"Whoso is not content with My decree, let him seek another Lord.\" Should a soul become aware of but one fruit from the tree of divine decree and comprehend it, joy and gladness, delight and expansion, submission and contentment would never depart from him. Extinction is the gate to immortality, and immortality the gate to extinction. Non-existence is the door to existence, and existence the door to non-existence. The blessed word \"All things shall perish save His Face\" is a source of patience and solace for the peoples of the world. After this death there is life, and after this concealment there is revelation. Blessed are the dead who become the gates of the supreme Paradise and the cause of unveiling and meeting! Destruction itself betokeneth construction, and ruin indicateth prosperity. Death and life are requirements of the consummate wisdom. Neither hath been, nor shall ever be, without effect or fruit. The Command is in God's hands. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. We testify that He is praiseworthy in His acts and is to be obeyed in His commands. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Book of God declareth that tribulations descend like torrential rain upon His loved ones, and this Wronged One in 'Akka is caught in the talons of hatred. Yet in all conditions We are joyous and glad. The life of this world in the sight of them that are endued with vision is reckoned as but a moment, therefore neither its hardship nor its comfort is worthy of mention. O Muhammad-Javad! We desired to console thee and comfort thee in what hath come to pass through thy Lord's decree. He, verily, is the Counselor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Hold fast unto the cord of patience. Verily, He is the All-Patient and enjoineth upon thee gracious patience. Grieve not over anything. Arise to serve My Cause, speak forth My praise, and act according to that which We have commanded thee and those who have believed in My perspicuous Book. Beware lest anything prevent thee from turning toward the Supreme Horizon. Soon shall the world and all that is therein perish, and there shall remain for its people that which the ears of the unifiers are unable to hear. Hold fast unto the cord of justice and righteousness, that there may appear from thee that whose fragrance shall endure throughout the eternity of My glorious and wondrous remembrance. The splendor shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon those whom affairs have not occupied from the Dayspring of Revelation, and whom the world hath not prevented from the Lord of mankind.

Blessed art thou for having drunk the choice wine of understanding and having held fast to the cord of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind. Thou didst attain unto that which most of the servants attained not, and wert steadfast in the love of thy Lord such that obliteration took thee not, and standing such that sitting followed it not, and speaking such that silence overtook it not.

This is a petition from the evanescent one to him who has dawned from the horizon of Sad for the love of God, our Lord and the Lord of the sincere ones, informing him of what the Ancient Beauty has commanded me in this station. He said - and His sweetest utterance is: O My Name Ha! No one should proceed to the land of Kha and inform its people of matters that have occurred in this White Land whose atoms proclaim that there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Loving. According to the command, I am to inform your honor that no one should specifically proceed to the land of Kha regarding occurred matters. If anyone has proceeded or taken anything, let him send it to the direction of the Intended One and definitely return it to its owner, and likewise that person himself should abandon the journey and return.

Thou didst turn to God by His leave and didst draw nigh unto Him to Whom the world hath turned, until thou didst enter the pavilion of eternity wherein was raised the call of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thou didst attain the presence of the Throne and didst hear and witness that which is inscribed in the Tablet of God, thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. And thou didst circle round the Throne on behalf of them that turned unto Him and believed in Him when He appeared with manifest sovereignty. All this is from His bounty unto thee.

The most excellent of all deeds in this Day is steadfastness in the Cause of God, such that the vain imaginings of the deluded pretenders may not hold back the loved ones of God from the court of oneness. Two unknown persons have gone to Gilan, laying claim to truth and uttering certain spurious and unsound statements. Some have followed these souls, and this following hath increased their pride and heedlessness, until certain assured souls arrived in that land and, through blessed words, awakened those heedless ones from the slumber of negligence. Had it not been for divine grace assisting them, all would have returned to the fire. We beseech God to purify the earth from such as these. I swear by the Sun shining from the horizon of the Cause that the harm of such souls is greater than the harm of the idolaters and deniers, for these matters have been and will be the cause of discord, perturbation and corruption. We beseech God to cause them to be overcome by one who will show them no mercy. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. In truth, such matters arise because of the friends, for their following of such souls causes these pretenders to become confused about themselves. During Our sojourn in Iraq and the Land of Mystery, and at the beginning of Our arrival in the Most Great Prison, We informed all of the rising clamor of these clamorous ones in most cities and regions. We beseech God to protect His loved ones from the evil of these people and to make them so steadfast that the clamor of every clamorer will not change them nor the doubts of the doubtful cause them to slip.

Even as the swiftness of lightning your days shall pass, and your bodies shall be laid to rest beneath a canopy of dust. What can ye then achieve? How can ye atone for your past failure?\n\nThe everlasting Candle shineth in its naked glory. Behold how it hath consumed every mortal veil. O ye moth-like lovers of His light! Brave every danger, and consecrate your souls to its consuming flame.\n\nO ye that thirst after Him! Strip yourselves of every earthly affection, and hasten to embrace your Beloved. With a zest that none can equal make haste to attain unto Him. The Flower, thus far hidden from the sight of men, is unveiled to your eyes. In the open radiance of His glory He standeth before you. His voice summoneth all the holy and sanctified beings to come and be united with Him. Happy is he that turneth thereunto; well is it with him that hath attained, and gazed on the light of so wondrous a countenance.\n\n=== END BH02198 ===\n\n=== START BH02199 ===\n\nWrite to his honor Zein on my behalf: O Zein! The most great convulsion mentioned in the Tablets of Divine decree from the Pen of the Lord of Creation has shaken the pillars of all lands and perturbed the hearts of the servants. Glory be to God! How many souls cling to their borrowed life and grasp onto this base world. Of what use is a life not sacrificed in the path of the Friend? A body not offered in the way of the Beloved is not worth a mustard seed. In all Tablets it has been revealed that the victory of God's Cause today has been and will be through wisdom and utterance, not through conflict and contention. Yet they committed that which was forbidden them. What was destined has come to pass. Soon will the words of the deniers and epistles of the polytheists be spread abroad. By the one true God! In the sight of those who gaze upon the Most Glorious Horizon, all that they have written has been and will be devoid of the garment of true meaning, deprived of the robe of acceptance, and bereft of the fragrances of truth. When the veils of fancy were rent asunder by the fingers of divine power, the words of the manifestations of Satan appeared more insignificant than the words of children. Take thou the Pen of might and power, by the sovereignty of thy Lord, the All-Compelling, the All-Choosing. Then write in response to them, in complete detachment, whatsoever God has cast into thy heart. Thus does He command thee in truth, as a grace from Us upon thee, and I am the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Compelling. Tarry not today in the Cause of God, for the clamor has been raised from every quarter. Take thou the most pure wine in My Most Great Name, then pass it round among the people of Baha, that they may drink and become detached from all that hath been created in the realm of existence, and soar unto the station of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Thus hath the Most Glorious Pen inscribed in thy name in these days wherein the hearts of the chosen ones have been sorely troubled. Say: By God! The Hour itself now wails and smites its head by reason of the severity of the Cause. The Resurrection itself hath arisen bewildered before the Face, turning now to the right, now to the left, as though waiting for that which is hidden from sight. Say: By God! The Trumpet hath not borne this most great blast, and the cords of the Balance have snapped, and the tribes of Names have lamented in the kingdom of destiny, and the seas have dried up, and the lands have been submerged, and the heavens of idle fancies have been rolled up in the grasp of the power of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Then was spread the carpet of certitude with sovereignty and power. By God the Truth! A single hair of those servants who have today shattered the greatest idol would be better in God's sight than all that hath been created on earth, and God would prefer it above all things, for they have borne what none before them have borne, whereunto testifieth the Tongue of God, the Peerless, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. Say: Were all the tablets and pages and books and scriptures between earth and heaven to be filled, and were no fragrance of My remembrance to waft from them, by God! The buzzing of a fly would be better than they in thy Lord's sight. Thus hath the Pen of the All-Choosing inscribed wondrous mysteries.\n\n=== END BH02199 ===\n\n=== START BH02200 ===\n\nO Majid! Hear thou the call of this Wronged One. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of glory and detachment that from the beginning of creation until now such tyranny hath not been inflicted upon anyone. Why dost thou sit at ease? Hast thou forgotten My wondrous melodies, or hath association with people made thee heedless? Thou hast witnessed My patience, forbearance and tranquility. Now consider what hath occurred that hath caused the lamentation, crying and wailing of the Beauty of Oneness. By God, besides Whom there is none other God! Had I drunk the cup of martyrdom at the hands of the most wicked of men, it would have been preferable to Me than that these matters which cause the abasement of the Cause should become known among the people. By God! My soul weepeth, and Mine eye, and My heart, and My pen, and from My sighs the dwellers of Paradise do lament, but the people neither perceive nor hear.\n\nO Majid! Thou knowest how much I strove to exalt the Cause of God, until it reached the station thou didst witness. And then the first token of love shown to this Wronged One was that they arose to slay Me and exerted their utmost to cut down the divine Tree. When this became known, this Servant withdrew alone to another house, that perchance the fire of malice and hatred might subside. Then they sent messengers to all regions writing that they had girded themselves to slay Me, and whatever they had done and whatever was in their hearts they attributed to the Divine Lote-Tree that none can know. Yet thou knowest that had this Servant desired to harm him, he would not have existed at all. When his writing was observed, I felt compelled to inform the people of these matters, lest they be led astray from the luminous path by the fabricated words he had written. By Him Who is unique in grandeur and glory! Had he remained quiet after this Servant's departure, this Servant would never have mentioned it. Among other things he wrote that they had left Me for want of bread. Observe the baseness and meanness of his soul, what he hath said and what he hath done. Let that honored one himself reflect. Having associated with this Servant for years, is it befitting to attribute such calumnies to the Lord of Names and Attributes, possessed of supreme sanctity and detachment? No, by the Self of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting! The mention of My tribulations hath exceeded both tongue and pen. I do but complain of My grief and sorrow unto God.\n\nIn any case, they will exercise the utmost scheming to cause thee to turn away from the Cause of God. O chosen one! Among all the servants, thou wert the first to attain unto God Himself and to believe in His presence. Stand thou firm in the Cause in such wise that through thy steadfastness all may become steadfast.\n\n=== END BH02200 ===\n\n=== START BH02201 ===\n\nHe is the All-Seeing, the All-Hearing, the All-Answering! O thou who hast turned to God! Hearken in this darksome night, wherein the light of utterance hath illumined the world, unto the call of the Lord of Names. They that account themselves among the learned and the perceiving have failed to hearken to the scratching of the Pen, being occupied with the imaginings of the peoples. Throughout the ages and centuries, one of the sects that considered itself the most exalted of all creation and the most pious of all servants - namely the Shi'ih sect - was found, at the appearance of the divine Touchstone, to be the most evil and the most lost of all peoples. Night and day they would rise from their pulpits at the mention of the Qa'im's name and cry \"May God hasten His advent!\", but the result of these false words became \"may God hasten their punishment.\" All were consigned to hell-fire save a few, as both the learned and the ignorant among them, at the bidding of these souls, strove to extinguish the divine light and martyred the Dayspring of verses. The cause and reason for this most great injustice was that certain lying souls united with that rejected sect and, through a hundred thousand tricks and deceits, brought forth mention of the Holy Land and of Jabulqa and Jabulsa and the like. Through false tales they firmly established themselves in the hearts and minds of that heedless sect, who even now await this evident Cause to appear from the imaginary Jabulqa. Far, far from it! Now certain barking ones in the land of Kaf and Ra have arisen in rejection and denial, and are engaged in contriving similar imaginary matters. They have not understood that this is the Day of God, known by this supreme designation in all the scriptures, tablets and books. Despite this they have again clung to former names. Say: O infidels! If the people of the Furqan reaped any fruit from that to which they clung, ye too shall reap the same. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of those who understand not. This is a Day wherein none is mentioned save God alone and His loved ones who have arisen to serve His Cause by His decisive and wise command. Say: Today the books of the world suffice not, except for this manifest, evident and perspicuous Book. Today the Mother Book speaketh and the Interlocutor of the Mount hath appeared and is manifest. All matters have depended and shall depend upon His will. The Herald, the Primal Point, proclaimed \"I am the first to worship Him,\" yet these shameless people strive to lead the servants astray. Blessed art thou for having drunk the wine of steadfastness from the cup of thy Lord's utterance, the All-Wise. Preserve this station through My Name, detached from those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds. The servant who standeth before the Face hath appeared and mentioned thee unto his Lord. We have remembered thee with this wondrous remembrance. We have seen thy turning to God and heard thy call. We have answered thee with verses from whose horizon hath shone the sun of thy Lord's grace, the Kind, the Generous. Glory be upon thee and upon all who are steadfast and firm.\n\n=== END BH02201 ===\n\n=== START BH02202 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty, the Everlasting, the All-Knowing, the Powerful!\n\nBlessed is He unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on earth, and all are His worshippers.

He giveth life to whomsoever He willeth through His command and causeth to die whomsoever He willeth through His authority. His verily is the might and the glory, His the grandeur and the splendor, His the power and the permanence, His the loftiness and the radiance, and unto Him do all return.\n\nO servant! Remind the servants of that which We inspired thee before the creation of the heavens and earth, before the creation of the Concourse on High, and before the appearance of honored servants. Fear thou no one, but place thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. We shall protect thee from those who have disbelieved and turned away, even as We protected thee from the serpent's mouth and raised thee to a praiseworthy station. Beware lest thou conceal thy beauty as thou didst conceal it before. Rather, reveal what thou art commanded and delay not the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Sovereign, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Beloved.\n\nCall thou the people to the Most Great Ocean which surgeth in thy name, the Exalted, the Praiseworthy. Then deliver unto the people what was revealed in the Bayan and tarry not for less than a moment. Command what is right and turn away from those who turn not their faces toward thy countenance.\n\nSay: I am the Beauty of God on earth, His Proof amidst His servants, His Evidence amongst His creation, His Testament in His realm, and His Path amongst His creatures, would that ye might know. Say: Whoso turneth away from Me hath turned away from God from all eternity, and whoso gazeth upon Me hath gazed upon God, the Generous, the Forgiving. Say: The faith of no one shall be complete except through entering beneath My shadow - and this is My shadow which hath encompassed the heavens and earth, wherein have entered the sanctified ones who dwell in the precincts of eternity, and none hath knowledge of them save God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nSay: O people! Fear ye God, then have mercy upon yourselves. Keep not distant from the station wherein the name of God is upraised at every moment and hour, at eventide and at dawn. Say: Nothing shall be accepted from anyone today except by My leave, would that ye might understand. Therefore, die in your wrath, O people of hatred, for God's punishment and His wrath have come upon you, and ye are tormented within your own selves. Then rejoice, O people of love, in the meeting with God and His days, and in His beauty and His signs - ye shall indeed rejoice! Thus have We inspired thee, O people of the Bayan, with that which I have been commanded by God, my Lord and your Lord, would that ye might hear. Whoso wisheth, let him accept, and whoso wisheth, let him turn away. Verily God is independent of them and of all who are in the kingdom and of all that they do or know. And the Spirit be upon those who have prostrated themselves before the countenance of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\n\n=== END BH02202 ===\n\n=== START BH02203 ===\n\nThat which descended from the right hand of the Throne - let Jim and ?ad, being gladdened by the fragrances of divine loving-kindness, know that special favors have ever flowed and will continue to flow from the threshold of the Divine Unity upon those messengers in the valley of the glory of the All-Sufficing. But O friends of God! Today stillness and tranquility are forbidden, while ardor and rapture and restlessness in the path of the Chosen Beauty are beloved. For if one observes with a subtle eye - by God the Truth! - verily the Most Great Paradise is stirring within itself and all that is ordained therein out of longing to attain the presence of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, Who hath appeared once again in His primordial garment, whereupon the embodiments of limitation fled from His presence - these wretched ones between earth and heaven. Know ye that the Most Great Paradise and all that hath been created therein of the essences of the hearts of the Maids of Heaven and the quintessence of the spirits of the secluded ones, as well as the subtle divine crafts and the jewels of holy creation - all are in motion today and restless from longing for the Chosen Beauty. Therefore beware lest ye grow cold in My love or choose silence regarding the wondrous remembrance of Me. At all times cast forth My new remembrances upon those who await the snares of My mention, that all may, through God's grace and bounty and through God's might and mercy, be set in motion like fire and become ignited, so that by the heat of these sanctified temples the people of the world may be consumed and refined by the fire of the divine Tree of Love, until the signs of God's fire become manifest and evident upon all else. Today the cup and what it contains and the one who takes it are all considered as one and witnessed before the Throne. But the sword of separation that hath appeared in the garment of the Word of God is occupied with its appointed task in all things, and soon will holy hearts surge forth from their hidden places like the manifestations of the fire of the Divine Tree and become visible in the world of appearance. Blessed are they and what they have attained from their Creator and what hath been ordained for them of God's mercy, the Mighty, the Luminous. Do not restrain the tongue from explanation and elucidation. At all times, dedicate heart and soul to teaching the Cause. And peace be upon him who conveyeth the Cause of his Lord and is not prevented by the derision of enemies nor their heedlessness nor their harm. Furthermore, be vigilant regarding the Cause of God at all times and never let go of wisdom lest harm occur. Convey the holy salutation, free from the veils of writing, to the servants of God and His loved ones, both female and male, from the tongue of God.

A hundred thousand thanks and praise unto the Ancient Lord who has purified His loved ones from treachery and all that is unseemly.

And I pray and send peace upon the Ocean of Oneness through whom were raised the banners of detachment and established the decree of God and His Command and the will of God and His sovereignty, and upon His family and companions through whom the Herald called out from all directions: \"The gates of cities and lands have been opened in the name of God, the Powerful, the Mighty.\"\n\nAnd then, by the life of our Beloved and your Beloved, your letter was an ocean of joy and a heaven of delight, for the luminary of truthfulness was dawning from its horizon and the sun of trustworthiness rising from its direction.

He said: \"Blessed is he and those with him and whosoever holdeth fast to justice and fairness in all matters. Praise be to God, they are adorned with the ornament of sanctity and holiness.

These are men whom neither the ornaments of the world nor the treasures of princes can distract from the remembrance of this News wherewith God hath gladdened His Books, His Scriptures and His Tablets. Blessed is he who hath clung fast thereunto and hath turned toward the court of His glory, and woe betide the heedless ones.\n\nO spiritual friend! The letters sent by thee were received. One of them was from his honor Shaykh Abu'l-Qasim, upon him be the peace of God and His glory. Blessed is he and joy be unto him, for from the words of his letter wafted the fragrance of love for the Lord of the Pen and the divine quill. By \"Pen\" is meant and hath ever been meant the Most Exalted Pen. It is the divine trumpet and the opener of the gates of the Lord's mercy and bounty. By its song have been enraptured the hearts of them that are endued with understanding and are sincere. Blessed is he who hath truly hearkened to its song, for he seeth himself detached from all things and standing at the gate of grace with such steadfastness as the hosts of rulers and divines and the denizens of the earthly realm cannot deter him. After perusal and review it was brought before His presence.

O Shaykh, peace be upon thee! Today these pages are illumined with the light of justice, for His Majesty Sultan Abdul-Hamid hath seated himself upon the throne of equity. Verily, tyranny and oppression have no place therein. In truth, he is occupied day and night with the affairs of both government and people. Today the eye of the world is brightened by him, and the equitable among God's servants are well pleased with his decrees. From the first day of Our imprisonment in the Most Great Prison until now, no adverse action hath been witnessed from His Majesty. Whenever the cry of the oppressed hath been raised from any quarter, he hath personally attended thereto and acted as befitteth his glory and might. All the people of his realm repose beneath the shade of the tree of his grace. Who is that lost one whom his favor hath not sought?\n\nIt therefore behooveth all of this community to supplicate the Self-Sufficient Lord with utmost humility and devotion for his protection and victory.

He is God, the Strong, the Prevailing, the Mighty.\n\nThis Wronged One hath ever beseeched God - exalted be His glory - to enable His loved ones to achieve that which is the cause of sanctification and detachment amongst His servants. Praise be to God, sedition, conflict, contention and warfare have been explicitly forbidden in the Book. We hope that they who have turned towards that which God hath willed may hold fast unto His commandments and act in accordance with that which they have been bidden. Perchance through the heavenly counsels and divine exhortations, the rancor and hatred burning in hearts and souls may be quenched, and mankind may attain unto that which is the cause of salvation and tranquility.\n\nWe send greetings to the friends in that land and counsel them to righteousness and piety. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to strengthen them, preserve them through the hosts of power and might, and draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions.\n\nHis honor 'Akkash, upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all names, together with his kinsmen, is remembered in the presence of this Wronged One.

Due to the sorrows that have befallen Us, replies are sometimes delayed and at other times dispatched immediately.\n\nThe effulgences of the Sun of divine favor are of such intensity that truly all the pens of the world and its peoples are powerless to reckon them. Whenever mention was made of any one of His loved ones before their Lord, the ocean of utterance would surge in such wise as to astound the world of existence. Despite encompassing sorrows and trials that have befallen Us, that which is a Clear Book for the preservation of God's servants and the prosperity of lands hath been revealed in every instant. This Prisoner beseecheth God that He may adorn the people of that place with the ornament of trustworthiness and godliness, and with that whereby their stations may be exalted in the earth. As for his honor's request for permission to attain Our presence, after the setting of the Sun permission was granted and made manifest. Well is it with him!\n\nThe letter from his honor Shams, upon him be the peace of God, was received. Praise be to God, as it was adorned with the mention and praise of God - exalted be His glory - and gave voice to the blessed word of divine unity, its fragrance brought forth joy and its words opened the gate of gladness.

I implore Thee by Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things to raise up from the earth one who will arise to help them, protect them, and secure their rights and blood money from those who have violated Thy covenant and Thy testament, and have committed that which hath caused the dwellers of the cities of Thy justice and equity to lament. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nGlory be to God! In the land of Ya (Yazd) in Iran, wolves have attacked the friends and the faithful, and have committed that which causeth the tears of those near unto God and the sighs of the sincere ones to fall and ascend. That misguided party showed no mercy to innocent children who remained without sustenance for several days, and it is reported that the followers of His Holiness the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ), peace be upon Him, provided assistance and secretly sent life-sustaining provisions. Although these acts were committed to extinguish the light, yet God hath made tribulations the cause of the exaltation of His Cause and the means for the upliftment of His Word, despite their will. Verily, He is the Just, the Wise. Soon will God raise up from the drops of the blood of the oppressed men who will help His friends and loved ones. Assuredly, after the darkness of tyranny, the light of divine justice shall shine forth, and after oppression, the sun of equity shall cast its rays. Verily, our Lord is the Just, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nAfter reading and reciting the letter of his honor Shams, upon him be the peace of God, we approached the court and it was presented in the presence of the Lord and was honored to be heard.

Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nMention of Akkas had previously flowed from the Pen, and We desire to mention him once again at the end of the Book, that he may rejoice and be among the thankful ones. O Akkas! Thy call hath been heard and thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One. The wolves in the land of Ya have torn the divine sheep. Today the lamentation and wailing of all things is raised. The manifestations of tyranny and wickedness, and the dawning-places of self and desire, have wrought that which hath no likeness or parallel. We beseech God to aid the enemies to return unto Him and to turn repentant to the door of His grace. Verily He is the Powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nConvey greetings from the Wronged One to the men and women servants in that land. Each one is mentioned and hath attained a bounty. We counsel all to righteousness and forbid them from evil, that all may be adorned with the ornament of godliness and attain the acceptance of the Desired One. Verily He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones and the Most Generous of the generous ones.\n\nIn the city of Yazd the workers of tyranny and wickedness wrought that which caused lamentation and wailing to arise from the solid rock. Hearts that were treasuries of the pearls of divine love were cut out, and temples that were illumined with the light of steadfastness were cut to pieces, then burned and cast into pits. And from the rushing winds of divine mercy that passed over those burned bodies, these words were heard: \"Alas! Alas! O people of Iran! Ye have martyred your true friends at the bidding of your enemies. O misguided party! What was the sin of the children and families? Soon shall the recompense of your deeds encompass you, and ye shall wail and lament and find no helper, for ye have become deserving of divine wrath. The hand of justice is manifest and evident, and hath not and will not overlook the oppression of the oppressors.

At that moment, the ocean of divine knowledge surged, and the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted, and the light of certitude shone forth from the horizon of proof. Exalted, exalted is this most great bounty, and exalted is this generosity that has encompassed existence, and exalted is this grace that has encompassed all peoples!\n\nO people of God! This day is the day of the most great steadfastness. The people of Baha are souls who have passed beyond the gulf of names and on the shore of the sea of reality have raised high the banner of true divine unity. Names, like the Shi'ih sect, did not prevent them from the light of divine unity. They are firmly attached to and focused on the Truth alone. These are they who are of the Crimson Ark, whose mention flowed from the Supreme Pen in the Qayyumu'l-Asma.\n\nO Muhammad! The countenance of the Ancient One has turned toward you from the direction of His Most Great Prison, and has mentioned you in that whereby your mention shall endure in the Book of God, the Lord of lords. This is a day through whose mention God's books have been adorned, both of old and more recently. Blessed is he who has recognized and attained to its effusions, and woe to every heedless doubter. Say: O people! By God, the Day and the Self-Subsisting have come. He has broken the seal of His choice sealed wine. Come and drink thereof in His Name, the Protector of all who are in earth and heaven.\n\nO Husayn! Hear the call of the Wronged One. He mentions you in that which will draw you near to God, the Dayspring of lights. When you find the fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance, say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having given me to drink the Kawthar of Thy knowledge from the cup of Thy bounty, and for having illumined my reality with the light of Thy recognition, and for having made known to me Thy straight and manifest path and Thy mighty announcement. I beseech Thee by the Banner which Thou hast raised by Thy command upon the loftiest spots of Thy earth, and by the Standard which has been lifted up in Thy Name and speaks before the faces of Thy creation, to ordain for me that which befits the ocean of Thy generosity and the heaven of Thy bounty. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and trustees who have spent their wealth and their lives in Thy path. Verily Thou art powerful over what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWe beseech God to assist you and likewise His loved ones to be steadfast, for the divine Cause in this Revelation is most mighty. Most of those who have turned to it thus far are unaware of the root of the Cause. The Mother Book bears witness to this in this lofty station. The lights of the Revelation of Him Who conversed with God have encompassed the world, yet eyes are veiled and prevented from beholding. We beseech God to assist all to draw near unto Him in all His worlds. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth, and He is the All-Bounteous.

We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to honor us with meeting Him soon.

This has so transported and enraptured me in such wise as none can reckon save God, the Lord of the beginning and the end. When I learned and discovered what was therein, I approached the gate and entered and arose and, after seeking permission, presented what the nightingale of love for you had warbled in remembrance of God, our Creator and your Creator. Then the countenance of the Beloved turned toward this evanescent one and said: \"Remember him on My behalf and give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy, that the joy of remembrance may so possess him that the sorrows of the world cannot sadden him nor the troubles of the nations affect him.

This is a great bounty from your presence upon me. All glory, all glory be upon you and upon whoever has held fast to the Sure Handle, and upon the loved ones there. I send my feeble greetings to them and seek their pardon for my transgressions which occurred due to my heedlessness in remembering them. I seek forgiveness in all conditions. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous. And I send greetings and salutations to the two Ha's before the Sin's who have attained to serving their Lord and who became strangers in His shadow to draw near unto Him.

We have sent thee Tablets before this, from whose horizon the sun of thy Lord's mercy shone forth upon thee, that thou mightest be filled with joy. And besides these We have sent thee this Tablet containing thy Lord's messages - deliver them unto His servants, fear no one, and place thy trust at all times in thy Lord. And if thou desirest to know what hath befallen My Beauty, by God! words fail to recount this Cause, whose measure even the hands of them that reckon cannot encompass. Were a thousand seas to be made ink for My tribulations, by God! they would be exhausted while the mention of My tribulations, visible from the horizon of destiny, would not be ended. And if thou wishest to know a trace thereof, breathe the air, and if thou detectest the fragrance of blood, then ponder what hath befallen the Beauty of the Ancient of Days from the arrows of those who disbelieved in God and denied His signs after He had, by His word, created their own selves and all who dwell in the kingdom, gathered together. We commanded thee before to emerge from behind the veil of silence and to speak forth between earth and heaven concerning this Most Great Remembrance, and to warble with the sweetest melodies in the Kingdom of Names and Attributes. Yet until now We have not heard thy call, as though thou hast held back in what We commanded thee. Beware lest thou hold back - be thou as a flame of God's fire kindled among His servants, that through thee may be set ablaze the hearts of those whom intoxication hath overtaken in these days when heedlessness hath seized both young and old. Raise thy call throughout the land and make mention of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, in these days when the hosts of polytheism have surrounded Him from every direction, and He hath no helper nor supporter in all the earth. Beware, beware lest thou turn to the earth and its people. Rather look with the eye of truth toward thy Lord's direction and be possessed of enlightened vision. Verily, they who have broken God's Covenant and devoted themselves to the idols of their own selves - these have no standing with God and are not mentioned before the Throne. And if thou findest one possessed of enlightened vision, reveal unto him the pearls of thy Lord's Cause, that perchance he may find peace in his soul and stand firm, by thy Lord's leave, upon the Most Great Path. O servant! Purify the hearts of the servants from vain imaginings, then illumine them with the splendor of thy Lord's remembrance. Thus doth the Temple of Eternity command thee, that thou mayest be faithful to the Covenant. Leave those who are veiled by delusion from the Sovereign of the Cause and have turned from the garden of nearness to the lowest of stations - the place which was created in fire, above fire, in the abyss of divine wrath. Thus have We remembered thee and sent thee that which will purify thee and purify the people from every rejected polytheist.\n\n=== END BH02210 ===\n\n=== START BH02211 ===\n\nIt is known that this servant has always been embarrassed before you, and never has anything worthy materialized that would allow me to manifest my inner love through outward expressions.

The water of life, if in darkness, is more beloved, as it has been and is, so that the neighbor knows not and the table-companion understands not, and the envious one is at peace and the envied one remains concealed. As for the rest, you must strongly urge his honor Mirza Muhammad Hadi - may God illumine his countenance - to remain preserved from the attributes and tongue of those people, meaning his speech should remain preserved from the accent \\[of Beg\\] and others, and in writing and knowledge they should certainly strive.\n\n=== END BH02211 ===\n\n=== START BH02212 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the One Who has dominion over all names!

Rejoice thou in that the Book hath been directed unto thee from this station, and verily it is a Book wherein We have detailed Our Preserved Tablet. We have desired to cause thee to soar in the atmosphere of remembrance and knowledge with wings the like of which have not been seen in the realm of creation, wings that are brought forth through the power of the Spirit which hath been breathed forth through the might of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And We have desired to make thee speak forth the praise of God, not with a tongue like unto the tongues of men, but rather with the tongue that appeareth from the Kingdom of thy Lord's utterance, the Director, the Mover, the All-Informed, that thou mayest arise to make mention in such wise as to move the world and awaken the nations. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the All-Powerful. He moveth all who are in creation through a word from His presence; the might of the powerful hindereth Him not from what He willeth, nor doth the force of those in the heavens and earth weaken Him. Give thanks for having been mentioned before the Throne prior to His manifestation and for having attained the breezes of the days from this luminous Robe.

I have proclaimed Thy Cause openly throughout the East and West of the earth, such that the pillars of the antagonists were shaken and the hearts of the oppressors were troubled. In all conditions I have been turned toward the horizon of Thy Cause and detached from all else besides Thee. Praise be unto Thee with such praise as causeth the mystics to soar unto the atmosphere of Thy bounty and favors, and attracteth the sincere ones unto the horizon of Thy revelation and gifts. And praise be unto Thee with such praise as burneth away the veils of all created things and the clouds of contingent beings, that they may turn unto the ocean of Thy reunion and be honored by attaining Thy presence in Thy days.\n\nO Lord!

O Lord! Aid him to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee in such wise that nothing that hath been created in Thy kingdom may hinder him. Then ordain for him what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, and decree for him the good of this world and the world to come. Verily Thou art the Lord of all creation.

However, this servant is much ashamed before Mirza, as it is absolutely certain that for one year or more nothing has been submitted to his honor. Yet the sublime Truth is witness and testimony that they are present and exist in the heart and before the eyes.

Beware lest ye commit that which would cause sedition. Be united in the Cause and be not of those who differ. Through unity shall the back of those who have disbelieved in the Lord of creation be broken. This will profit you, if ye be of the certain ones. We desire for you naught save that which draweth you nigh unto God. Hearken unto the truth and follow not the steps of Satan. O thou who remembereth Me by My remembrance and gazeth upon My countenance! Deliver unto the people that which We have commanded thee, that perchance the breezes of Paradise may stir them and turn them toward the Qiblih of the worlds. Cleanse the people with the water of inner meanings which We have deposited within the verses. By My life! It is indeed the water of life which the All-Merciful hath sent down from the heaven of grace for the life of the worlds. The night hath passed wherein God counseled those around Him. Gather ye beneath the shade of what hath been raised up from this divine Lote-Tree. Thus do We counsel you as We counseled before. Blessed are they who attain. Beware lest ye differ in God's Cause and follow the imaginings of the doubters. He is with whosoever remembereth Me and aideth this Cause through which the fragrance of the All-Merciful hath wafted amongst the worlds.\n\n=== END BH02228 ===\n\n=== START BH02229 ===\n\nMuhammad-'Ali Khan, upon him be the Glory of God, the All-Merciful!\n\nHe is God - exalted be His glory in wisdom and utterance!

This is a Tablet from whose horizon hath shone forth the Day-Star of thy Lord's favor, the Lord of all existence. We have mentioned thee before with such remembrance as cannot be equaled by all the treasures of the world nor by that which the nations possess. He Who possesseth the Hidden Book beareth witness to this. How many a learned one have We left to himself, and how many an unlettered one have We rescued through My favor that dominateth every witness and witnessed thing! This is a Day wherein the heaven hath spoken, the sun hath testified, the moon hath proclaimed, and the Divine Lote-Tree hath cried out, yet the people understand not. The world hath been illumined by the Most Great Name, the Mount by its Interlocutor, the Throne by its Lord, the Light by its Dawning-Place, and the signs by their Source, yet most of the people know not. They hearken unto the manifestations of fancy and idle imagination that which keepeth them back from the Most Great Vision and draweth them nigh unto the fire. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness that there is none other God but Me, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Say: O people! By God, the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree hath been raised up, and the Caller hath called from the right side of the blessed Spot, saying: Fear God and follow not your desires. Follow Him Who hath come to you with a manifest sovereignty. Thus hath the Most Great Ocean revealed the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, and the Sun its effulgence and its lights. When thou hast attained, arise and say: Praise be to Thee, O Lord of the seen and unseen! Behold, then mention what the people of the Bayan have committed, who turned away from the All-Merciful and opposed Him with such tyranny as caused the denizens of the Kingdom to lament. They cast the Most Great Ocean behind their backs, hastening toward the pond. Verily, they perceive not. We have observed thy devotion and have turned to thee once again, mentioning thee with that which gladdeneth the eyes and rejoiceth the hearts. When thou hast attained unto My Tablet and drunk the choice wine sealed with My Self-Subsisting Name, say: My God, my God!

Blessed is the station that hath been illumined by the lights of Thy beauty, the land honored by Thy footsteps, and the atmosphere wherein Thy call was raised. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence and Educator of the seen and unseen, by the Ark which the winds and waves could not hinder and which sailed through the ocean of Thy Cause, and by the subduing power of Thy Most Exalted Pen, whereby Thou hast subdued earth and heaven, to assist me to attain unto Thy presence before Thy throne, that I may hear what the Son of 'Imran heard on the Mount of Knowledge. O Lord! Deny me not Thy presence and nearness, nor the fountain of Thy reunion and meeting. Then I beseech Thee to teach me what Thou hast intended from the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy grace. I am he, O my God, who knoweth not what profiteth him.

Blessed is the Most Truthful One who turned toward My Most Exalted Horizon, detached from all else, until he attained the presence and stood before the Gate, and heard what the Beloved heard during the Night Journey and what the Interlocutor heard on the Mount of Knowledge. We have mentioned him in such wise that his remembrance, his glory and his deeds shall endure throughout the duration of My earthly and heavenly dominion, and throughout the continuance of My sovereignty and power.

In His days you have drunk from the ocean of recognition and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of proof. The grace of God, exalted be His glory, has been with you - He made His path clear for you, revealed His evidence, and you saw and heard and were blessed with acceptance, which is among His greatest bounties. What is beloved from you today is steadfastness and assistance. Steadfastness attracts the favor of God. Until now no steadfast one has been deprived, as testifies to this He Who possesses the Clear Book.

I beseech Thee by the influence of Thy Will and the power of Thy Purpose not to deprive me of what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones and Thy loved ones. Thou art He through Whose power all things have testified and through Whose grace all created things have been made manifest. The hosts of the world cannot withstand Thee, nor can the might of nations. The clamor of the divines and the power of rulers cannot weaken Thee.

We have forgiven thee and purified thee with the water of My favor, and then those for whom thou didst seek forgiveness from the Dayspring of the bounty of the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen.

Glad tidings unto thee, O Ahmad, for having journeyed and attained unto the presence of thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. Give thanks unto God for having aided thee to recognize the Dawning-Place of His Cause and for having caused thee to hear His wondrous Call. Although thou didst present thyself before receiving permission from thy Lord, yet God hath pardoned what is past as a bounty to thy father, who is among Our sincere servants. Be thankful that We have accepted thy visitation and presence before thy Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have inscribed for thee a station in the Tablet. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. Return to thy homeland by God's command and decree, and be not of the hesitating ones. When thou seest thy father, convey unto his face the greetings of this Wronged One, the Peerless. Say: Blessed art thou for having remained steadfast in thy love for thy Lord and for having voiced His praise after He was imprisoned in this distant place. Blessed be thy face for having turned, and thy heart for having advanced, and thy tongue for having uttered His beauteous praise. Say, O Javad: God willing, through the bounty of the Lord of creation thou shalt ever voice the remembrance of the All-Merciful and attain His endless outpourings. At all times strive mightily for unity among the loved ones of God, that perchance the idols of vain imaginings and differences may be shattered and the standards of unity and harmony may be raised. This is what is beloved in the sight of the Beloved of the worlds. The gaze of His loving-kindness hath ever been fixed upon those souls who have turned to the countenance of their Lord. He hath not wished, nor doth He wish, that they should be deprived of the Dawning-Place of the lights of oneness through human fancies. If thou shouldst meet the letter Jim, say: Dost thou know by what proof thou didst advance and then by what evidence thou didst turn away from the All-Merciful? Nay, by His very Self, the Truth! Thou knowest not, and We see thee among the veiled ones. Hear My words, then look at this Revelation and what hath appeared from it, detached from all thou hast heard. By God, thou wouldst then cast aside what thou hast and turn toward the court of thy Lord's grace, saying: \"I have turned unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds!\" Thy likeness is as those who cast the Most Great Ocean behind their backs and gathered around a pond. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. He who led thee astray is in the fire. Soon shall he who misled him join him. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a luminous Book. O Javad! Convey to all the loved ones the greetings from the True One. Blessed is he who hath been named Servant-before-Hadi; he is among the triumphant ones. Since previously Tablets were revealed and sent to all specially, therefore at this time none hath been revealed specially, but they have been and are in mind. This is the essence, and thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.

Deprive not yourselves of that which is good for you from the kingdom of the hereafter and of the former time. Know ye the value of these days, then hasten to the station wherein hath appeared the Most Great Sign of God from the light of God, the Most High, the Most Exalted. Say: By God! This indeed is the Supreme Prospect which hath been described in all the Tablets and in what was revealed unto Abraham and Moses. And this verily is the good which none have understood save those possessed of insight who, when they heard the Call of God, responded with their words \"Yea!\" These are they upon whom are blessings from their Lord and who are among the followers of guidance. Therefore look thou upon thy station in what God showed thee in thy sleep from the stories of former times, that thou mayest know what We have unveiled for thee from the mysteries of eternity that lay concealed beneath the veils of destiny - that which was hidden and concealed. Say: Verily He possesseth a vision that seeketh, and before Him walketh the light of Oneness which kindleth and shineth, whereby are guided those who dwell in the most exalted paradise, and whereby go astray those who dwell in the sanctuary. And this is what was inscribed in the scrolls of the Spirit at the Furthermost Tree, and this is what the Most Exalted Pen and the Spirit have set down. And peace be upon thee and upon those who have soared in the atmosphere of nearness, then were guided. And fire be upon him who denied God, then was wretched and turned away from the path of justice, then transgressed and was among those who went astray and erred. O beloved! Announce unto the servants of God the Most Exalted Word of God which the Spirit hath revealed once again and which the Mighty in Command hath sent forth from the heaven of power, that He may teach you the ways of Paradise and guide you to the pavilions of the Most Glorious.

Therefore hearken unto what is revealed unto thee from what hath been inscribed of the divine decrees upon tablets of ruby by the Most Sweet Fingers, that it may deliver thee from the ornaments of the kingdom and attract thee to the stations of the Spirit in the most faithful homeland. Well is it with him who hath heard the Word and submitted to the Word of God, and his eyes overflow with tears; then he hearkeneth and his heart is set ablaze with the fire of love, then doth it surge. And this is what the Pen of the servant hath inscribed in this eternal and most glorious Tablet which God hath named with the letter \"S\" after \"H\" in the Kingdom of Names.

All these stations are from the grace of the Lord of the worlds, for were it not for the winds of bounty that blow from the right hand of His grace, no soul would succeed in attaining unto His good-pleasure or would become illumined with His recognition. As thou observest, many among the servants who awaited the Truth night and day, yet after its appearance none attained unto His recognition save whom thy Lord willeth. Therefore must these servants at all times be thankful for His wondrous grace, and seek from Him the power to remain steadfast in His love and to be detached from all else besides Him. Ere long will the days of life draw to a close and we shall all take up our abode beneath the earth. In that station there will be no helper or companion save His grace. The rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the mighty and the lowly - all shall enter that station of absolute oneness in the same way, and all distinctions and glories of this earthly kingdom shall be completely effaced, and nothing shall be of any benefit in that place save the wonders of His grace. Therefore must thou beseech God that we may not be deprived of His grace and bounty, and may not remain without portion of the river of His mercy, and in these few fleeting days may not become heedless of His remembrance or turn unto aught else besides Him. In times when hardships and trials descend, we must be patient, and in times of comfort and ease we must be grateful.

But the counsels of God had no effect. Upon the deaf rock divine commands and prohibitions bestowed no benefit. Night and day they occupy themselves with calumnies. Due to the unworthiness of the servants these things have occurred and continue to occur. Glory be to God! The luminary of justice should shine forth from the horizon of Iran. Now it shineth forth and is manifest from the horizon of Ishqabad. A hundred thousand regrets that the people of Iran are deprived and forbidden from the fruits of the blessed Tree which appeared therein. By the life of God! This is the recompense of their deeds in His days. Verily He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We beseech God to assist Iran to execute justice and fairness. Verily thy Lord loveth faithfulness in all conditions. In these days they should seek help and counsel from the Wronged One in its preservation and protection. But heedlessness and ignorance have prevented man from that which would profit them. This is the recompense of deeds on the day of reckoning. Each day foreign commands and ordinances gain influence, and through this influence the influence of the people of Iran is curtailed. Ask of God that He may awaken the slumberers and rouse them from sleep. Perchance they may hold fast to that which is the cause of success and prosperity. But alas! Soon will two fingers join together. Then shall ye behold them in manifest loss. Thus hath the Lord of all being made mention of that which was hidden from sight. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Seeing.\n\n=== END BH02241 ===\n\n=== START BH02242 ===\n\nHe is the Expositor, the All-Knowing!\n\nO Hakim! The conditions of self and passion have encompassed the world. Every day from the clouds of the tyrannical ones' glory rain down calamities. The rights of the people have been entirely lost. This Wronged One observed that every year warfare and conflict would arise between the Babi and Shi'ih parties, with many slain on both sides. In the battles of Nayriz, ?abarsi and Zanjan, nearly fifteen thousand souls were consigned to death. For the protection and preservation of God's servants, this Wronged One, with no helper or assistant save a single pen, aided both government and people, and through loving counsels and wise admonitions removed killing and plunder from their midst. We transformed weapons into instruments of peace. For forty years no one has moved contrary to what God has willed. Thus in the land of ?ad the oppressors of the world perpetrated that which caused the Supreme Pen to lament, and in 'Ishqabad occurred that which brought grief to all the world's different parties. You have surely heard the details. Yet in no instance did the people of God rise in self-defense, but rather held fast to submission and contentment. Nevertheless the unjust people remained heedless and manifested a wickedness that had and has no equal or likeness. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of the oppressors. Praise be to God that the martyrdom of His loved ones in this Most Great Cause transformed rejection and denial into acceptance and recognition, such that this party now associates with all the world's parties in utmost love and fellowship. The hearing and sight of the people have likewise progressed, and wings besmeared with clay have been cleansed and sanctified by the Kawthar of utterance and are now capable of flight. We hope that grace and favor will teach all a new way of soaring, that perchance the helpless people may attain rest and freedom from the vain imaginings of the world's clay-dwellers. Although the wickedness of the oppressors has reached such a degree that the pens of the world are incapable and powerless to record it, strive, O Hakim, that perhaps your counsels may serve as a barrier between the fire of malicious souls and the helpless servants. Although in truth abundant fruits have appeared, for since the day that strife and conflict were forbidden in the heavenly Books, no more than nineteen souls have perished over forty years. Say: O servants! We have previously stated that ye are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch. In the station of love and kindness be as rain-laden clouds, and in seizing the conditions of self and passion be as a blazing flame. Strive to exalt the blessed Most Great Word, that perchance the withered leaves of earth may become fresh and verdant through the spring showers of the mercy of the knowing and accomplished ones. The glory from Us be upon you and upon whoever hearkens to your words concerning this Most Great Announcement.\n\n=== END BH02242 ===\n\n=== START BH02243 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Bestower of favors and bounties! O Samandari in the realm of earth and heaven! Your letter has come before Us and was read at the Throne, attaining the honor of being heard while the Ancient Beauty was established upon the throne of grandeur and majesty. We found in it that which indicated your name and saw in each word of it the fire of your love for your chosen Lord. Ask God to make that fire a magnet to attract the hearts of all in the world. He is verily the One with power over whatsoever He willeth. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.\n\nAs for what you mentioned therein about your sadness - this We have not chosen for you. Rejoice in My favor unto you, for nothing that can be mentioned or described in creation equals it. How can sadness overtake you when you find yourself upon the shore of the ocean of joy and gladness? Be not grieved by anything. Trust in God. He is with you in all conditions. What you asked for - We have answered you through Our servant who is present before Us. Thy Lord is verily the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Trust in Him and commit all affairs into the hand of Power. He sees more than you and desires for you what has not entered the mind. This is what behooves you. Thy Lord is verily the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nSoon He will exalt your station and make you a sign of guidance. He is verily the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. Beware, beware lest anything sadden you. Drink the Kawthar of joy from the hand of thy Lord's favor, Who has appeared and shines before your face. Be moved by the fragrance of joy and attracted by the verses of thy Lord, the Speaker, the Mighty, the All-Wise. Make Him your guardian and the guarantor of your affairs. He is verily the All-Sufficient, the Faithful, the Giver, the Bountiful. This is a word through which the essence of My favor and the pure wine of My providence for you have been made manifest. Be thankful to Him for this with a gratitude that no worldly thanks can equal. Thus does the Mighty, the All-Compelling command you.\n\nO Samandar! Hearken unto that which thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, calls out to you. Arise to aid the Cause of thy Lord in such wise that thereby the standards of the Bayan may be raised upon every lofty mountain. Be a guardian of the House of the Cause, then protect it with the swords of remembrance and utterance lest thieves find any way thereto. Circle round about the House at all times lest it be pierced by a mouse or dug into by a rabbit or entered by a treacherous deceiver.\n\nBehold the people - they see the lights of the Sun shining from the horizon of grandeur and majesty, and the seas of verses and proofs surging between earth and heaven, yet they have denied this bounty and taken for themselves the calf as lord instead of God. Woe unto them and unto those who follow the desires of such as these! Verily they are among those whose names the Pen does not wish to inscribe, and from whom every accursed devil flees. Ask God to aid them to recognize the Dawning-Place from which countless suns have shown forth, and to open their eyes to the knowledge of this Great Name. Glory be upon thee, O thou who hast turned to My face, arisen to serve Me, and spoken forth My wondrous remembrance.\n\n=== END BH02243 ===\n\n=== START BH02244 ===\n\nIn the Name of the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! O 'Ali-Akbar! We counsel thee even as We counseled thee before with that which will manifest the station of man in the contingent world. Exalted is the All-Merciful Who created the world by His command. He is verily the All-Bountiful, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thou hast attained the presence of the Wronged One and heard what His tongue hath uttered in His mighty prison. Now that one hour hath passed from Monday night, this servant hath attained the presence of the Wronged One. We have desired to make mention of the friends of God who have drunk from the choice wine of oneness and who are gazing toward the Most Exalted Horizon, that all may attain unto the most great joy and drink from the ocean of gladness. The names of all have been and are before Us. Praise be to God, they have been and are assisted in benevolent matters from God and are journeying unto God, that is, their beginning and return have been from God and unto God. God willing, may the light of this station be seen manifest and resplendent before their faces, that they may thereby walk upon the straight and manifest path. On this blessed night, suddenly mention was made of them and the face of the imprisoned Wronged One turned toward them. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to inscribe them as the dawning-places of His most excellent names in the Book of Names by the Most Exalted Pen. Verily, He is powerful over all things and worthy to answer. O friends! For some time the religion of God hath been seen to be weak, and the enemies have risen from all directions with the utmost oppression and tyranny. The sun of justice is concealed behind the clouds. Beseech and supplicate the True One, exalted be His glory, that perchance He may change this weakness into strength and this tyranny into justice. Hold fast to the cord of His grace and be confident in His loving-kindness. He is the Powerful One Who hath subdued the world by a single word and by two letters hath brought forth the manifestations of names and the dawning-places of attributes from the concealment of nothingness into the realm of existence. Glory be unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names and in Whose right hand is the dominion of all things! I beseech Thee by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy grace that Thou write down for us that which befitteth Thy generosity and bestowal. O my Lord! We are Thy servants and Thy creation. We have turned toward the lights of Thy countenance and hastened to the shore of the ocean of Thy loving-kindness. Wilt Thou disappoint, O my God, Thy weak servants who have found no helper besides Thee, no ruler other than Thee, and no one merciful except Thee? O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath encompassed all created things and by Thy mercy that hath preceded all contingent beings, that Thou send down upon us from the heaven of Thy bounty that which will cause us to be numbered with them who have hastened unto the river of Thy grace, who have held fast to the cord of Thy generosity, and who have clung to the hem of the robe of Thy loving-kindness. O my Lord! Thou art He to Whose greatness, power, glory, might and all-encompassing authority all things have testified. Look upon us, O my God, with the glances of the eyes of Thy mercy and ordain for us that whereby the eyes of Thy loved ones may be gladdened. Verily, Thou art the Almighty Whom nothing whatsoever can frustrate and no affair can render powerless. There is no God but Thee, the Doer, the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\n=== END BH02244 ===\n\n=== START BH02245 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him Who dominates over all who are in the unseen and visible realms!\n\nO Farrukh Kh., say: My God, my God!

O Lord! Protect Thy party from Thine enemies, then open before their faces the gates of generosity and bounty through Thy power and sovereignty. O Lord! Thou seest the weak ones of the earth turning toward the horizon of Thy might. I beseech Thee not to disappoint them in what they desire from Thy grace in Thy days. Verily Thou art He to Whose bounty and mercy and power and might the rock hath testified, and the sea to Thy greatness and glory, and the sun to Thy power which hath encompassed Thy kingdom. Thou art He, O my God, Whom armies cannot withhold nor ranks frighten. Thou doest what Thou willest and ordainest what Thou pleaseth. Verily Thou art the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nHas the eye of the world ever witnessed such a bounty, or has the comprehension of nations ever been enabled to enumerate it? Nay, by His own Self! That which was beyond the grasp and understanding of those in the world hath appeared. Through the power of His Pen, He hath removed all causes of contention, warfare, discord and differences from the tablets and established that which leadeth to harmony, unity, love, fellowship, friendship and oneness, and commanded all to observe these. Those possessed of true vision and inner hearing should turn somewhat their attention - they will observe all besides God as non-existent. This servant, with utmost helplessness and supplication, beseecheth from the wondrous divine grace and infinite mercy that which will cause the elevation of the stations of this party. It is hoped that this most great party, through the lights of the Ancient Beauty, will neither pay attention to nor draw near to that from which the odor of corruption emanateth, and will know and hear their own reward and station. Most people have now testified to the absence of corruption in this wronged party. This is in truth established before those possessed of insight, but due to the negligence of some who harbor enmity without cause, they have detected from some means of reformation the odor of corruption. We seek refuge in God from this. The Cause until now in all tablets hath spoken of what is known, nay of that which is well-known. Blessed are those souls who look with the divine eye. Assuredly when intention becomes pure, the effulgences of the light of reformation become manifest and evident. Verily our Lord is the Compassionate, the Generous, the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. As for the mention made of Hashim Bey, upon him be the Glory of God, after it was presented in the Most Holy and Exalted Presence, these holy and blessed verses were revealed - thus speaks He, mighty is His utterance and evident His proof...\n\n=== END BH02245 ===\n\n=== START BH02246 ===\n\nO Fadlu'llah!

Say: O people, act according to what the All-Merciful hath commanded you in the Book and follow not every ignorant remote one. Thus hath the Wronged One mentioned thee from the precincts of His Most Great Prison that thou mayest be of the thankful ones.\n\nHear in the Persian tongue these exalted and holy words: Praise be to God that thou hast attained to the recognition of the Dawning-Place of Divine Revelation, which today hath become the object of rejection and opposition by most of the people of the world, and thou hast hearkened unto His call. O thou who art mindful! The whole world was created to behold His horizon, hear His Word and act according to His command. This is a truth to which all the world doth testify and acknowledge. Yet after the appearance of the Divine Day and the establishment of the form of the All-Merciful upon the throne, all turned away and arose in utmost opposition and hypocrisy, save a few. Now ponder the station of these few. By the life of God, the Pen of possibility hath been and shall ever be powerless to describe such souls. We beseech God to make these holy souls firm and steadfast in His love. He is verily the Hearing, the Answering.\n\nAs for what thou didst write regarding mention, it hath been and shall ever be most beloved. O Fadl, the story of sacrifice hath been renewed, and Isma'il hath turned his face to the place of sacrifice and in the path of the Beloved of all possibility hath drunk the cup of martyrdom. He acted according to that which was revealed from the Supreme Pen in previous years in the Persian tongue:\n\nO sacrifice of God, from love's altar-place\n\nTurn not back, but give thy life in love's ways\n\nAnd this sacrifice returned not alive from the altar-place. He sacrificed his life, his wealth, his honor, his name and all that pertained unto him. O Fadl! These are days of tribulation. The martyrdom of Husayn hath been renewed and Hasan hath given up his life. By the Most Great Ocean, the Concourse on High are engaged in lamentation and weeping. Blessed is the one who maketh mention of the tribulations of the friends of God who in the land of Sad attained unto the most great martyrdom.\n\nO Fadl! Make mention of Hasan and Husayn. By My life, the Messenger doth lament and the Pure One doth cry out, yet the people are in evident doubt. Thy deed is accepted, approved and beloved. Make mention from the pulpits, for We have given thee permission as a bounty from Our presence. Thy Lord is verily the Commander, the All-Choosing.

Blessed art thou, O my brother, in that thou wert made a target for the arrows of destiny in the path of God, the Lord of the Kingdom of Names. Joy be unto thee, O thou who spoke with God, in that thou didst attain unto the lights of the Ancient One. I testify that thou didst fulfill the Covenant when the people of discord broke it, and didst hasten to the Most Exalted Horizon when the call was raised between earth and heaven. Thou wert with thy Lord in times of hardship and tribulation until thou wert exiled with Him from the Land of Ta by reason of what the hands of the wicked had wrought. And thou didst arrive with thy Lord in Zawra, the place which the All-Merciful made the seat of His throne for successive years. I bear witness that thou didst believe in God and acknowledge what the Tongue of Grandeur uttered amongst all created things, and didst drink the choice sealed wine when its seal was broken by His Name, the Self-Subsisting. And thou didst migrate once again from Iraq with the Luminary of the horizons, and stood before His face morning and evening until thou didst arrive with thy Lord in the Land of Mystery which was named Adrianople, and from thence to the Most Great Prison. And thou wert with Him for numbered years, and present before the Wronged One morning and evening, until thou didst soar on the wings of longing unto God, the Lord of the Day of the Covenant, and the verses of thy Most Glorious Lord drew thee to the Supreme Paradise - that station wherein naught can be seen save the manifestations of the grace of thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, the Ancient of Days. The glory that hath shone forth from the heaven of the bounty of thy Lord be upon thee and upon thy beginning and thine end, thy outward and thine inward self, and the mercy of God and His blessings.

I beseech and hope from God that this bounty may ever be bestowed and draw the friends to the ocean of joy. In truth, that beloved has been and is troubled by hardship - would that it were from common hardships, but rather they have been necessary, complex, weighty and difficult hardships. However that beloved does not acknowledge or admit to the hardship, for every burden has been and is made light through love. It is love that has opened paths and unlocked doors. In an instant it traverses the East and West of the world. It is the sign of the Ancient among nations.

The servant has received your noble letter which was honored by the mention and praise of God. When I took it and opened it and read it and found from it the fragrance of sincerity to God, the Lord of the worlds, I went and approached and entered and presented what was in it before His countenance. He said - and His sweetest utterance is: \"O servant! Make mention on My behalf of him who loved Me and desired My presence, and convey greetings unto him and magnify his countenance, and convey to him from the Wronged One that which will gladden him and attract him. We beseech God to grant him the good of the hereafter and of the former life, and to ordain for him and those with him His everlasting bounty and His perpetual table.

Then did the utterance speak forth in the kingdom of proof in such wise that this servant was struck senseless. When he recovered, he beseeched God, the Lord of the Covenant, for the unity of the loved ones throughout all regions. Verily He is the Answerer, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\nThey said: O Name of Generosity! We have heard your call and witnessed your turning to Us. We beseech God to assist you and grant you the good of the hereafter and this world. In His grasp are the reins of all hopes and in His right hand are the destinies of all souls. At times He speaks that which draws the servants near to Him, and at times He manifests that from which the people of error flee.

Or if they come on horseback, that is also good if they come two at a time separately. This lowly one conveys greetings to each one and gives them the glad tidings of attaining the presence.

We hope that God, exalted be His glory, will illumine and adorn all with what hath been mentioned. Verily He hath power over all things.\n\nAt one time We made mention in the preface of the Book of Detachment of the blessed, decisive Word of the Friend, that perchance its fragrance might perfume the world and make the peoples aware. When the fire of Nimrod's tyranny was aflame and the decree to burn the temple of the Friend of that time - may our soul be a sacrifice for Him - issued forth from that dayspring of polytheism, there appeared from His Holiness that whose fragrance shall never cease from the worlds of inner meanings, utterance, wisdom and knowledge. When they suspended Him in the fire, Gabriel, by God's command, came to Him and asked: \"Hast thou any need?\" He replied: \"No, not of thee.\" By the life of God, the fragrance of this utterance illumined the realities of existence with the light of detachment. Should any soul attain to the heat of this utterance, he would pass beyond the world and all therein and would hold fast to what God hath willed.\n\nBe not grieved at what hath befallen thee. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to open and keep open the doors of grace and bounty before the faces of His loved ones. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.

Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, and glory be to Thee, O my Aim, and greatness and laudation be to Thee, O my Beloved, for having confirmed me in recognition and made known to me Thy straight path and Thy mighty Message. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty to ordain for me that which will exalt me through Thy name amongst Thy servants. O Lord!

There is none other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nWe desire in this moment to make mention once again of thy brother who ascended to the Supreme Companion. We testify that he stood firm in My service, spoke My praise, and drank the choice wine of My love from the hand of My bounty. We beseech God to send down upon him at all times mercy and loving-kindness from His presence, and to give him to drink, from the hands of the Manifestations of His might and Cause, the Kawthar of His bounty. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Effulgent, the Compassionate, the Generous. And We make mention in this station of thy wife, whom We mentioned in the Tablet of Bounty, as among those who believed in God and His signs, who attained unto His recognition and drank the Salsabil of knowledge in His days. Thus have We sent down verses from which surged the ocean of forgiveness and wafted the fragrance of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of the seen and unseen. And We have revealed for her that whose fragrances shall not cease throughout the duration of God's kingdom, the Sovereign of existence.\n\nO Mahmud! Give thanks to thy Lord for having mentioned thee and thy brother and thy wife with verses that cannot be equaled by treasures.

These words flow not from tongue or pen except with firm, steadfast constancy. Blessed be his honor! Indeed he stands in service and speaks in praise. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist him in preserving this most exalted station.

And if in this regard some harm befalls the heirs, the Right will compensate and bestow. The intention is that his honor Haji should strive and endeavor in the will to the extent that no corruption arises, and beyond that is not permitted. The Command is in God's hand - He does what He wills and decrees what He desires, and He is the Powerful, the Mighty.\n\nAs for his own things and property, let his honor Haji oversee them or send a trustworthy, astute person.

This is the station of the most great steadfastness, the ultimate goal, and the highest summit.

Today from the waves of the Ocean of Utterance of the Goal of all worlds, this word was heard: O people of God and His chosen ones! Aid your Lord through what He hath revealed in His Book. Beware lest the clamor of the ignorant prevent you from drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. Blessed is the ear that hath attained to hearing the Word of God and hath held fast with supreme steadfastness. Some immature ones in the world are deprived of the Names while claiming them. In the great city appeared that which made every person of insight aware of the deeds of those who accepted and those who turned away. Ask of God that He protect the servants from the vain imaginings of the previous people. In the Dispensation of the Qur'an, conflict and contention arose over names - in the name of Imam, successor, chief, noble one, fourth pillar and the like - they engaged in battle, cursing, reviling and rejection. Yet on the Day of Reckoning not a single pure deed appeared from the divines and mystics of that group. All are aware that that group turned away and ultimately issued the decree for shedding the most pure blood of the Dawning Place of Divine verses. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by Thy power that hath encompassed all created things, by Thy sovereignty that hath surrounded all existence, and by the sovereignty of the Names whereby Thou hast subdued earth and heaven, to adorn Thy servants with the effulgences of the Day-Star of justice and equity. Thou art the Possessor of bounties and favors. O my Lord! Thou seest me turning toward Thee and detached from all else but Thee. Ordain for me that which befitteth the heaven of Thy generosity and the ocean of Thy grace. Thou art the All-Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. They asked about \"the meeting of the two seas.\" In earlier years the Most Exalted Pen wrote about the interpretation and inner meanings of the divine Books, and likewise about unveiling the symbols and allusions of the companions of the Bayan and their meanings - that which every person of knowledge hath testified to the Ocean of divine knowledge. However in these days We have not been and are not inclined to interpretation and inner meanings. These verses have been sent down from the heaven of the Manifestation of clear proofs: This is not the day for questions and answers. Rather it behooveth every soul, when hearing the Call from the Supreme Horizon, to arise and say: \"Here am I, O Lord of Names! Here am I, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all in the heavens and earth!\" In these days you and the friends of God must hold fast with utmost joy and fragrance to that which is the cause of exalting the Word. You have been confirmed, praise be to God, in acceptance, turning and hearkening in days when most people of the world are seen to have turned away. Be not grieved. We beseech God to open before your face a door of His doors of grace and mercy. Verily He is powerful over what He willeth and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. The Glory from Us be upon you and upon those who heard the Call and said \"Yea, yea, O Lord of the Kingdom of Names and the Manifest One through Thy Most Great Name, the Most Glorious!\"\n\n=== END BH02262 ===\n\n=== START BH02263 ===\n\nO thou who art mentioned before the Throne! Know that the idolaters made My family and loved ones captives from Iraq and brought them to other lands. Yet the fire of hatred in their breasts was not quieted thereby. Then they turned with blackened faces against faces of light, and banished Us from the Land of Mystery and made Us enter 'Akka. It is the most desolate of the cities of the world. When We entered the prison, its doors were guarded by souls who had never inhaled the fragrance of faith from the Egypt of certitude, nor had the breezes of the All-Glorious ever wafted upon their hearts. Three successive months passed and We did not enter a bath. Thus did it befall the Youth at the hands of those who denied God's favor after its descent. By God! We have not complained of what befell Us, nor shall We ever complain, through God's might and power. Would that no tribulations had touched anyone in His path save Me! By His glory, I long for all of them in His love and the manifestation of His Cause. Hardship and ease both pass away, and what endures is what is with thy Lord. Where is he who built As-Sadir? Where is he who sought to ascend to the ether? Where are the Pharaohs and where are the kings of old? Where are their trellised gardens and furnished houses? Where is he who drank pure water while beauties circled round him? Where are their couches and crowns and might and dominion? They have descended from their strongholds to their graves. By My life! If all people were to hear the cry of but one of them, they would forsake the world and turn to the Most Exalted Horizon. Has not the time come for those who sleep to awaken and those who are heedless to become aware? Do they think they shall not depart, shall not enter the graves, shall not be gathered tomorrow and questioned? Far from it! Their imaginings are false, their abode is the abyss, and they shall find none to protect them unless they return to God, the Lord of creation. My Pen has been restrained and My body imprisoned. I face toward the Most Exalted Horizon while behind Me a serpent lurks. Soon shall the veil be lifted and the companions emerge. Thus have We related unto thee from the tales of the Youth, of what was and what shall be, after We were forbidden remembrance and utterance. Say: By God! The Youth shall not be prevented from the remembrance of God, though all who are on earth should oppose Him. Be thou not grieved by anything. Remember thy Lord - He is with thee and will aid thee through His sovereignty. He is the Protector of those who remember Him. Say: O people of Baha! By God, this is the Day wherein the sincere shall stand firm and the doubters shall flee. Say: It behooveth you in such days to manifest your certitude and steadfastness and love for your Lord, the All-Merciful, and your support of His Cause amidst His servants. He will protect you in truth - He hath power over all things. Convey My greetings to My loved ones, then gather them on the seashore and remind them at all times.

Were but a single wave from the waves of this sea to become manifest, it would cause all who are in the heavens and on earth to be drowned therein. The glance of grace hath ever been directed towards thee - He is, verily, the Mighty, the Generous. That which will gladden thy heart hath been ordained for thee in the Tablet. Grieve thou not over anything, but be thou among the joyous ones. Behold the power of thy Lord, how He hath seized the foreigners through a sovereignty from His presence, and those who expelled Us from the Land of Mystery - verily He is possessed of mighty strength. Thus was it sent down aforetime in the Tablets, and when the appointed time came to pass, that which was inscribed therein was made manifest, that all might be assured that He is, verily, powerful over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Impregnable, the Almighty, the Peerless, the All-Informed. We opened the door in those days lest there occur again that which had occurred.

Whosoever drinketh therefrom shall fear no one, and heaven and earth cannot withstand him. Thus hath the sacred Pen of glory irrevocably decreed.\n\nBe thou steadfast in the Cause of God, and in that which hath been prescribed unto thee, and fear no one. Place thy trust in Him, He verily shall protect thee from every plotting sinful one. By God! Whosoever hath the love of this Youth in his heart, God shall verily render him victorious over all who dwell upon earth and heaven, and verily God shall be the witness thereof. He shall walk upon water as he waketh upon the earth, and shall soar in the realm of the Spirit in the limitless expanse of heaven. Thou shalt find the infidels fleeing from this Youth as mules flee from the lions of eternity, and they shall turn upon their heels, and shall violate the Covenant of God after It hath been revealed.

Distance preventeth Him not from what He willeth, nor do the veils of contingent being conceal Him, for unto whomsoever calleth upon Him, He is near. And at the moment when the glorification issued forth from the mouth of God, thy Lord, the tongues of the Concourse on High were loosed in glorification of thee, and this was a bounty which was great before the Throne. Blessed art thou in that thou didst attain the presence of God while yet young, and when thou didst grow older the breaths of the All-Merciful took hold of thee from this Paradise which was made manifest through the Word of God at the dawn of time, visible at the right hand of the Throne. Be thou steadfast in the love of God, then enter upon the Ark of eternity which saileth upon the sea of names through My Most Glorious Name. Fear thou no one, but put thy trust in God. Verily He will sanctify thee from the doubts of those who are seized with vain imaginings and idle fancies and who stand arrested in the wilderness of heedlessness by the most great intoxication, turned away from the truth.

This is the Primal Point Who came to you with all the signs and hath appeared in this final revolution with the Most Great Mystery - secrets beyond reckoning. Thereupon the idolaters dispersed from around Him and cast Him into the well of darkness, and at every moment they hurled upon Him the darts of misery. None was aware of this save God, Who knoweth all things. And from the depths of the pit He crieth out saying: \"O people of the Bayan! Be fair, by God, and look upon that which hath been sent down from before the Throne, and be not tyrannous oppressors in the land. O people! This is not from Mine own self, but the Spirit speaketh within My breast, and My proof hath filled the horizons. Besides it, naught hath been sent down from the presence of One powerful and self-subsisting.

We behold thee speaking at all times in praise of thy Lord, even after thou wert imprisoned among the silent ones. And We see thee possessed of sight amidst the blind, and standing firm among those who sit. Through thee was raised the scratching of every pen and every wise decree was expounded. Through thee were hearts drawn to the Beloved, and the hearts of lovers were set ablaze with the fire of separation, and the Face illumined the horizons. Verily thou art among those who are firmly established. How long wilt thou gallop in the arena of utterance? Dost thou see any who would race with thee? By My life, We behold thee bewildered in reply, gazing to the left and to the right. O Pen, recount unto the Lord of Eternity: We behold thee bearing all tribulations and afflictions, yet never ceasing from utterance in remembrance of the All-Merciful. Dost thou make mention of Him for love of those on earth or of Him Who created it? Tell Me truly, for verily thou art the Truthful, the Trusted One. How can I mention, O my God, my condition, knowing well that Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Informed? The fingers of Thy Will move me, and Thy prevailing Purpose directeth me throughout all worlds. O My Pen! Tell Me what thou hast, for thou beholdest Me a stranger among the oppressors. None is there to speak with Me of that which would gladden Me in this Most Great, Most Mighty Cause. O My Pen! We have heard from thee diverse melodies and countless strains. Hast thou a melody whereby the world would be attracted and every mouldering bone be quickened, such that nothing would remain save that it would hasten unto thee and turn toward this luminous horizon? O my Lord! No power have I before the manifestations of Thy might, nor any knowledge before the surgings of the ocean of Thy knowledge. All things are dependent on Thy Will and conditioned by Thy Purpose. I testify that Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. Were I to find a hearing ear, I would manifest what lieth within Thy knowledge, for verily Thou art the One Who ruleth as He pleaseth. Where are the attentive ears that would hear what is sent down at every moment from the Kingdom of Utterance? And where are the eyes that would behold Thy bright and wondrous countenance?

In this state He summoneth all unto the Mighty, the Beloved. Be as thy Lord was, in such wise that no mention would prevent thee from His mention, nor any description from His description.

Arise to aid the Cause of the All-Merciful through wisdom and utterance and say: O peoples of the earth! By God!

Beware lest the tyrants of the earth and the pharaohs of the lands prevent you from the Cause of God, the Lord of all men. The divines of the earth who cast behind them the command of God and followed vain imaginings and idle fancies have wronged Me.

By what proof did you believe in Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime, and by what reason do you turn away from Him Who, when He came, all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom is God's, the One, the All-Forgiving\"? By God! He bore witness to Me before My appearance, and before Him did the Books of God - O ye who are endowed with understanding! The books of the world have submitted to My Most Great Book, and the tongues of nations throughout the ages and centuries have testified. Yet when He appeared in truth and the standards of the Revelation were made manifest, they turned away therefrom except those whom God delivered through His power and authority. They lamented My separation, spent their wealth for My Name, and entered the temples for My remembrance; yet when I manifested My Self, they disbelieved in Me and disputed My signs which have encompassed the horizons. My servant named Abu'l-Hasan has come into Our presence and mentioned your condition in relation to the Cause of God.

Then remind them of that which We counselled thee in Our presence, in such wise that no blame from any critic may grieve thee in the path of God, nor may the allusions of any heedless one veil thee, nor the doubts of the opposers prevent thee. Be as a fire in thy love for thy chosen Lord, that through it may be consumed the veils of idle fancies which have covered faces and enveloped the hearts of those who have turned towards Him.

This is the wine of oneness and the pure water of detachment which hath flowed from the Pen of grace of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Whatever hath appeared until now from certain souls We have forgiven. Praise be to God, the ocean of forgiveness hath encompassed all who have returned and turned towards Him. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Kind. And We beseech God to assist thee to arise to serve His Cause with spirit and soul and essence and body, in such wise that its traces may become manifest in all cities and lands. This is among the great bounties of thy Lord.

On other days they should engage in occupation and the earning of livelihood, and should regard such occupation itself as worship of the Self-Sufficient Lord, so that through this means mankind may be delivered from the idleness and sloth that has overtaken most regions. The first is the Day of Baha of the month of Baha, which is the ancient Naw-Ruz and the Festival of the Fast, marking the beginning of months and years, wherein the bounties of God are made manifest on that day beloved of all worlds. The second is the Most Great Festival, which is the king of festivals, being those days when the Ancient Beauty emerged from the Most Great House and illumined the Najibiyyih Garden with the light of His countenance. This is also called the Festival of Ridvan and the Festival of Roses, comprising twelve days from the Ancient Beauty's first entry into that garden at the afternoon hour of the thirty-second day after Naw-Ruz, until His departure from the garden at noon of the forty-third day after Naw-Ruz. Work is forbidden on three days of this blessed festival: the first day, from afternoon to afternoon; the ninth day; and the final day. On the remaining days they may engage in their occupations. The third festival is the fifth day of Jamadiyu'l-Avval 1260, near the evening hour when the Exalted One - may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for Him - by command of the Sovereign Who doeth what He willeth, made His declaration to the Babu'l-Bab, upon him be the glory of God. Therefore that night and day are of supreme greatness before God, and honoring this blessed festival is among God's commandments binding upon all the people of Baha. The fourth festival is the Birth of the Ancient Beauty, who at the second dawn of the month of Muharram 1233 illumined all the world with the light of His beauty. Concerning the date of that blessed nativity, in that poem which I composed in the Land of Mystery by command of the Mighty Sovereign, tracing events from the beginning of creation until the day of that Most Great Luminary's birth, this verse flowed from the tongue to the pen: \"Be ready, O friends, be ready indeed, The Hidden Day \\[1233\\] has come - no child was born before.\" That blessed day is among the most noble and greatest of festivals. The first of Muharram, being the birth of the Herald of the All-Glorious Beauty, the Most Exalted Lord - may the spirit of all worlds be sacrificed for Him - is joined to this festival, and both constitute a single festival. However, the blessed birth of the Most Exalted Lord occurred at midnight on the first of Muharram 1235.\n\n=== END BH02278 ===\n\n=== START BH02279 ===\n\nHe is the Dawning Place from His Most Exalted Horizon\n\nThis is a remembrance from the Wronged One to him who hath turned unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that the fragrances of remembrance and utterance may draw him to a station wherein he shall behold naught save the lights of the face of God, the Lord of what was and what shall be.

There is no God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Loving. This is He Who hath stood before all faces and summoned all unto God, the Lord of existence. Neither the power of princes nor the opposition of divines held Him back. He spoke that which He was commanded by God, the Lord of the Promised Day.

O Lord! Thou knowest that I have migrated in Thy path and turned to the ocean of Thy knowledge and the heaven of Thy bounty until I entered the prison by Thy command and was honored by meeting Thee and attained unto the hearing of Thy call and drank the choice wine of reunion from the hands of Thy bestowal.

Ordain for them, O God of existence, from Thy grace that which befitteth Thy greatness and is worthy of Thy sovereignty. O Lord! These are days wherein Thou hast sent down Thy Books and Scrolls of glory and Psalms and Tablets, and wherein the stars of Thy commandments have shone forth from the horizons of the heaven of Thy grace. I beseech Thee by them and by those who have submitted to the manifestations of Thy Cause, to ordain for Thy loved ones that which will gladden their hearts and solace their eyes. O Lord! Illumine the face of the earth with the lights of the sun of Thy justice and adorn its thrones with the temples of the dawning-places of truth and fairness, that the countenances of those who love Thee and who have believed in Thy signs may smile with joy.

By Thy glory, O King of the kingdoms of justice and Sovereign of the cities of bounty! Such tribulations have come upon them that no pen of creation can recount, and should it attempt to mention them, it would not know what to record. Yet since these afflictions have been endured in Thy path and for love of Thee, they give thanks to Thee in all conditions, saying: \"O Beloved of our hearts and One remembered in our breasts! Should the arrows of tribulation rain down upon us from the clouds of destiny, we would not complain in our love for Thee, but would thank Thee for this, for we have recognized and are certain that Thou hast ordained for us naught but what is best for us. And though our bodies may at times be distressed by these trials, our souls rejoice in them. By Thy glory, O Desire of our hearts and Joy of our breasts! Every punishment in Thy love is mercy, every fire is light, every torment is sweet, every toil is rest, and every sorrow is gladness. O Lord! Whoso complaineth of tribulations in Thy path hath not drunk from the cup of Thy love nor tasted the sweetness of Thy remembrance.\"\n\nI beseech Thee by the Sovereign of Names and its King, and the Manifestation of attributes and their Creator, and by those who have soared in the atmosphere of Thy nearness and meeting and have tasted the sword's edge in Thy path, to assist all Thy creatures to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self, Who is imprisoned in exile for having summoned all creation unto Thee. O Lord! Thy mercy hath preceded Thy wrath, Thy loving-kindness Thy fury, and Thy grace Thy justice. Take hold of the hands of Thy creatures through the wondrous tokens of Thy favors and gifts, and cut them not off from the means which Thou hast ordained for the recognition of Thy Self. By Thy glory! When these are cut off, every soul becometh perturbed, every man of wisdom is bewildered, and every knower is confounded, save him whom the hands of Thy Cause have taken and whom the evidences of Thy grace and the influences of Thy favors have seized.\n\nBy Thy glory, O my God! If Thou shouldst regard Thy servants according to their deserts in Thy days, they would merit naught except Thy chastisement and torment. But Thou art the Generous One, possessed of great bounty. Look not upon them, O my God, with the glances of Thy justice, but rather with the glances of the eyes of Thy grace and favor. Then deal with them according to what beseemeth Thy generosity and bounty. Thou art, verily, powerful to do what Thou willest.

Say: By God, those who did not heed My words are burning in the fire of their own selves, if you but knew, and We are innocent of them. And those who emigrated and traveled without Our leave, by God, they are dead in the veils of their own selves. Soon their news shall reach you, if you be patient. The baker whom God loved in his heart has come to Us, and We heard from him that which caused the hearts of those who believed in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, to tremble. Say: Have mercy on Me, O concourse of the beloved ones! Be content with the tribulations and trials that have afflicted Us. Say: By God, if similar deeds appear from you, the harm will return to Us. Say: Do you not reflect within yourselves upon the fruits that will come from the tree of your suspicions after Me? Or do you, following the desires of your souls, do what you know not? Say: Fear God and forget not My counsels - this is better for you, if you but knew. No fruit has come from this tree that has grown in the soil of your selves except the destruction of Myself and those with Me, could you but see with the eye of the spirit. By God, the harm of this matter is greater than the harm inflicted upon Us by Our enemies. Therefore, O people of the Bayan, have mercy upon Me! I swear by God that the harm of this repugnant matter all returns to this Servant. Say to the people of the Bayan: None has ever heard until today of one who, with the tongue of friendship, would show complete enmity. After all, after the departure of this Servant, what use remains for this matter and what benefit accrues from it? By God, all that they do is vain! And it has come to pass that I, meaning this Servant, demonstrate with a hundred thousand oaths My powerlessness, showing that these matters and their like are ultimately harmful to the Cause of God, yet still they do not become aware. They must either be false in their love or consider this Servant false. I complain of My grief and sorrow unto God. Verily, we are God's and unto Him do we return. God is witness to the condition that merely hearing of this matter has caused the utmost harm - how much more its occurrence! In any case, immediately upon receipt of this writing, either summon Haji Abdul-Rahim and Haji Abdul-Majid, or go to them yourselves. Beseech them to forgive Us, to show mercy to these little ones who are with this caravan, not to cause any harm to befall them. By God, this matter will cause divine assistance to be cut off.

Warn those who have veiled themselves from meeting Him in His days and who deny His verses. Say: Woe unto you, O people of vainglory! Do ye bar men from the paths of God while ye claim to be Muslims? Do ye acknowledge God in your souls while ye play with His verses? Have ye a proof greater than this? Produce it then, if ye be truthful! Can the Book which is in your hands be greater than this? Glory be to God concerning what ye imagine! Say: All verses have been sent down from the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting, and all signs have appeared from His presence. There is no difference between them if ye look with the eye of oneness. Say: If ye have any proof, evidence or argument other than this, then bring it forth and tarry not! Say: The Beauty of knowledge hath appeared from behind the veils of the hidden. Say: The Sun of Beauty hath risen at high noon, yet ye turn away from it. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and be not veiled from Him for Whose meeting ye were created, if ye but knew! Do ye deny God's grace while ye witness it? Do ye flee from the Truth while ye behold it? If ye deny the lights of this Countenance, then to what countenance will ye turn? If ye close this Door upon your faces, then through what door do ye wish to enter? Fear God and deprive not yourselves of these breezes sent by the Beloved. Whether ye accept or turn away is equal before God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Your belief will not profit Him nor will your rejection harm Him, if ye but knew. But ye shall lose that which ye shall never find again, though ye seek it from all eternity and weep and lament in His absence. Arise from the beds of heedlessness and seek illumination from this Lamp which hath been lit in the Lamp-niche of holiness, from which the inhabitants of the heavens and earth have been illumined, and those men who circle round the Throne. Fear God and cast not the Book of God behind your backs, nor the Word of God behind your souls, if ye understand. Thus doth God cause the Salsabil of holiness to flow from this confined Pen, and through it establish truth and abolish falsehood, if ye would ponder His Manifestation. If He wished, He could reveal from it mysteries of what was and what will be, and manifest from it that which would necessitate Tablets of preserved glory.

We counsel you to patience, whereby your station shall be elevated before God, the Revealer of verses. Blessed is the servant from whom emanates the fragrance of patience in the days of God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWe make mention in the Persian tongue: Ever has the decree and destiny of God, exalted be His glory, existed among creation and continues to exist. Destiny, in one sense, is a divine herald among the servants, informing them of the changes and transformations of the world and its transience. However, patience in these circumstances is superior to most deeds. This is why the chosen ones and the near ones are content and thankful in these situations. The Seal of the Prophets, may the spirit of all else be sacrificed for Him, repeatedly experienced the passing of His children from this mortal world. Read what God has revealed in His Book, His exalted Word: \"Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.\" The polytheists gloated, for they saw that His Holiness was without issue. Thus the door of gloating was opened and the tongue of hatred moved, until Gabriel descended and recited the aforementioned verse in His presence. These words stemmed from ignorance and enmity. Had they reflected even slightly, they would have understood that the Book itself was an enduring proof and eternal traces. Every word that flowed from His blessed tongue was adorned with the ornament of eternity. However, the disease of prejudice in those days, and before and after, deprived most of the people of the world from the shore of the ocean of grace and bounty. The polytheists spoke such unseemly words that Gabriel again appeared and recited the blessed Surah \"Verily We have given thee abundance,\" and from this verse the sterility of the opposers and fabricators became clear and evident.\n\nSay: Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having illumined my heart with the light of Thy utterance and for having sent down to me that which has made my soul content with Thy decree. O my Lord! I am Thy servant and the son of Thy servant. I hold fast to the cord of Thy good-pleasure and the hem of Thy decree, and I glory in this among Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the worlds Who hath appeared through the Most Great Name, to assist me to manifest that which Thou hast commanded me in Thy Book.

The mystics have always received and will receive their portion of that merciful fragrance, while those afflicted with the cold of self and desire have been and shall be deprived of this holy and eternal fragrance. The blind have no share in beholding the dawning of the Day-Star of the horizons, and the deaf have no portion in hearing the melodies of the birds of eternity. That which has ever deprived people from the living waters has been imitation and idle fancy, as you observe among the people - they worship vain imaginings and perceive it not, they bow down before idols and understand not. Consider the physical eye - how by a thin veil it is prevented from beholding all that exists between earth and heaven. Likewise, how can the inner eye, with the thick veils of idle fancy and imitation, perceive the shining of the lights of divine unity without limitation? In brief, this is the condition of the people that has been mentioned, and this servant has been afflicted among such a group throughout his life. We beseech God that He may cause to appear the Friend of divine might and power, that He may shatter the idols of idle fancy and desire. Verily He is the Powerful, the All-Choosing. Furthermore, since you have traversed the paths and drawn nigh, joy has appeared - perchance God will bring about through this some matter. It is hoped that with purified vision you will gaze upon the Greatest Scene in such wise that the veils of the people of creation will not prevent you, nor will the opposition and objection of the people of polytheism and hypocrisy become an obstacle. This is not difficult for God. Moreover, you had expressed bewilderment. Although bewilderment in one station is beloved and acceptable, as the Prince of the Chosen Ones, may the spirit of all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake, has said: \"Lord, increase my wonderment in Thee\" - for such bewilderment arises from beholding the lights of the revelations of the Beloved. Thus it has been said: \"I became not bewildered until I chose Thy love as my path; How great then is my bewilderment if it be not in Thee!\" The glance of love has ever been directed towards you, and it is hoped that through divine assistance you will emerge from the bewilderment you mentioned and enter the paradise of holy unveiling and witnessing, and arrive at the city of certitude and assurance.

The joy of this wine shall not depart from thoughts nor vanish from existence.

We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist them that through them the light of justice may shine forth in the world and among the nations.\" They certainly show the utmost love and kindness towards one such as yourself. We praise God in all conditions. End quote.\n\nSimilarly, the mention of the loved ones of that land and their love and fellowship towards that beloved one became the cause of joy and gladness. After it was presented at that time, expressions of favor were heard and witnessed towards each one. The loved ones of God, exalted be His glory, have never been and will never be absent from His sight, and they have been and are mentioned at most times. I beseech the All-Bountiful One to adorn each one with the ornament of His favor and love. He is the Hearer, the Answerer.\n\nThe trouble, attention and kindness of that beloved one, and the dispersion in the path of God - the conversation with the Roman, that is, that imaginary Christian, as well as the time spent fixing the fountain in the garden, the place of recreation for all in creation - in truth these are deeds whose reward shall not end and whose mention shall not perish.

Say: O people! Arise to establish the Cause of God and follow not your desires if ye be them that move within the shadow of the Cause. Fear ye God, then shun the grievous sins and desist from that which ye have been forbidden. Fear ye God and tread not the paths of vain hopes if ye be them that walk in the ways of holiness. Say: O people! Be not divided regarding the verses of God which have been sent down unto you in truth, but hold fast unto the cord of God - and this is of His cord - if ye would ponder within yourselves. He it is Who hath caused the sun to shine through His power and the moon to beam with His light and hath made the rivers to flow as a bounty from His presence, that ye may gaze upon the signs of God's mercy and be grateful unto Him at all times, then place your trust in Him in all affairs. Thus do We expound the verses unto you and remind you of the truth that ye may draw nigh unto the precincts of nearness. Say: O people! This one is a servant of God and His attendant in the kingdom who desireth naught save your betterment, as honored servants bear witness. Therefore arise from the couch of heedlessness and aid him with your hearts, your souls, your spirits, your bodies and with all that hath been ordained for you, if ye wish to be of them that render aid. And if ye aid him not, know then that He will aid His own Self through His Being and will raise up His Cause through the truth - and this is a matter which all the worlds are powerless to comprehend. Say: O people! Consider the generations of the past and what befell them, though they were mightier than you in strength, greater than you in glory, and more exalted than you in station. All of them went to their places and were buried with their deeds and returned to dust as they began the first time - and this is the evident truth. And ye shall return unto them and shall be questioned concerning what your hands have wrought and what your ears have heard and your eyes have beheld, and all that ye did in the vain life. This hath been inscribed in truth upon the preserved tablets of glory. Therefore fear ye God, then return regarding that wherein ye were remiss, then take counsel from what We have counseled you, that ye may attain unto what God hath desired for you. And glory be upon you and upon them who have been illumined by the lights of the countenance and were among those who entered the precincts of glory.\n\n152 God willing, move forward in all matters relying upon God and admit no sorrow to yourself.

We gave thee to drink of the purifying Kawthar when the Lord of Manifestation came with a sovereignty that encompassed the worlds.

Beware lest the doubts of the people of denial or the veils of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds, withhold thee.\n\nWe have created thee for My service and taught thee that wherewith We quickened hearts from time immemorial and whereby We shall resurrect every mouldering bone.

Then mention them through the wonders of Our remembrance, in every line of which lieth concealed an ocean from the oceans of life, from which We have distinguished this Name whereby all in the world were overturned, save whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, hath willed.

Verily words cannot take the place of deeds. Hold fast unto goodly and pleasing actions, and purify yourselves from the defilement of divine prohibitions that ye may attain unto true rest.

This is a Day wherein that which was hidden hath been revealed and that which was treasured hath appeared, by the command of God, the Ordainer, the All-Knowing. The fire of tyranny and wickedness hath been kindled, whereby the light of righteousness and godliness hath been veiled, through that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought in the land of Ya.

He who was seated hath arisen, and he who was silent hath spoken.\" For years justice had been deprived and no trace of it was found. Praise be to God, in these days it hath appeared from the horizon of power with standards and banners of victory. Two mighty deeds were manifested by the friends in that land: first, refraining from retaliation against the oppressors, and second, interceding with the authorities on behalf of their enemies. O H!

Where is my Hasan, and where my Husayn? Announce their fate, nor be of them that turn away! Did my Hasan deal faithlessly amongst you, unlawfully devour your wealth, or shed your blood?

The Tale of Taff (Karbila) hath been retold; yet are the people wrapped in a palpable veil. We, verily, concealed the station of My Name Hasan by reason of the frailty of Our servants; then, when he was ascended on the wings of the spirit unto the realms above, We disclosed a part of that which God had bestowed upon him, in token of His grace: He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Know further: That which hath come to pass shall exert an influence in the world: erelong shall this become apparent through the sovereignty of God, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. Oppression hath reached the pitch that alike the pen and the tongue are powerless and inadequate to recount or express it. Souls who at no time harmed another soul; who comported themselves with perfect love and kindliness; and who lived on terms of friendliness with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth - behold what was inflicted upon them! Were it to be inquired of those two embodiments of ignorance who regard themselves as learned, \"Wherefore slew ye these wronged ones, notwithstanding that no crime or sin had been committed on their part?,\" they would, in reply, undoubtedly repeat the same words uttered by the mouths of the infidels in respect of the Prince of Martyrs - may all else but him be His sacrifice. After the business of the Land of Kaf, the company of the oppressors were wont to repeat this utterance:\n\n\"Husayn beyond his limit stray'd, \\* so slain was, by his grandsire's blade.\"\n\nFie upon them, and upon those that have followed in their footsteps! This apart, what blame attached unto the Prophet's children who were in that household? This business shall never be obliterated from the tablet of creation. For all four souls there hath been sent down from the heaven of God's loving-kindness that which hath changed the world's happiness into grief. Although to outward seeming the people of oppression are complacent about the deed they have committed, yet, by My life, their realities curse them, and lament over them, albeit they neither hear, nor feel, nor know it.

The Wronged One hath heard and answered thee with verses that neither the circumstances of the world nor the succession of ages and centuries can alter. They shall endure as long as My most excellent names and exalted attributes endure. To this doth the Creator of heaven bear witness from the most sublime station. Cast aside all else but Me, then take the cup of life in My name, then drink therefrom the wine of divine knowledge by My leave and bounty. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the Bestower.

Among the people are those whom the attraction of their Lord's verses hath so seized that they have cast away the world, turning unto God, the Lord of eternity. They came, heard, responded, and attained unto that which was recorded in the hearts of the Prophets and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in My Preserved Tablet.\n\nThou didst seek forgiveness from the ocean of thy Lord's mercy, the All-Merciful. We have purified thee, as a bounty from Us, with the waters of loving-kindness and favors. Verily thy Lord is the All-Compassionate, the Most Kind. When thou dost inhale the fragrance of My words and attain unto the traces of My Pen, make mention of My days and what I have endured at the hands of Mine enemies who cast the Command of God behind their backs, following every rejected learned one and every ignorant reprobate. They who arose at Our mention pronounced judgment against Us, and when We manifested the Cause, they turned away from Us and objected to Us with such injustice as caused the denizens of the Kingdom to lament.

He, verily, is the Witholder, the Giver, the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nThrough His sovereignty He hath manifested servants possessed of love and understanding, and made them the hands of His Cause amongst His creation and the lamps of His guidance amongst His creatures. The servant beareth witness, and every discerning one who knoweth and every learned one who is informed beareth witness that He is God, there is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nFurthermore, I have read what flowed from the ocean of your love and the words that shone forth from the horizon of your turning unto God, our Lord and your Lord. I beseech Him at all times to make us among those who circle round Him in all His worlds which none hath comprehended save God, the Numberer, the Informed. May my spirit and my soul be offered up for your love and your steadfastness and your remembrance.\n\nAfter I became acquainted with what was in your letter, I ascended and approached the Beloved of the world and presented it before His face.

His Lord, the All-Merciful, is verily the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\"\n\nAs for what thou didst mention regarding Sasun, let him act according to what flowed from thy pen.

Transgress not against those who transgress against you, and be ye of such disposition that the gloating of enemies in God, the Lord of all worlds, grieveth you not. Those who gloat over you and shake their heads in derision, these are in manifest loss.\n\nThou art he who hath been faithful to God's Covenant and His Testament, and hath spoken that which made the back of polytheism to quake. This is attested by Him with Whom are the oceans of knowledge and wisdom, and that which none hath comprehended save His Self, the One dominant over all who are in the heavens and earths. Grieve not at what the polytheists utter. Rather, rejoice in that which the Speaker of Sinai uttereth, Who hath come with the truth by a Command that hath thunderstruck all who are in the heavens and earth, save whom God willeth, the Lord of this exalted Station.

This is a profit that shall see no loss throughout the duration of the kingdom and the heavenly realm, as attesteth He with Whom is the Mother Book.

He is the Hearer and the Answerer. Second, the letter from the radiant star, His Holiness the Afnan, upon him be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, hath renewed the heart and soul with the fragrances of love. In truth, mention of God's loved ones, especially the Afnans of the Divine Tree, is like the breaths of the spirit for bodies. I hope it will ever continue to arrive without delay or interruption. This evanescent servant hath ever besought and continueth to beseech the True One, exalted be His glory, to support the Afnans of the Divine Tree, upon them be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, and to bestow upon them such special bounties as would cause every counter to confess his inability and every possessor of speech to acknowledge his shortcoming.\n\nTo his honor the esteemed Afnan-i-Kabir, upon him be all Glory most glorious, I express my utter powerlessness and nothingness. Likewise to his honor the Last Star and the honored ladies, upon him and them be God's peace and loving-kindness, I convey mention, praise and greetings. To the honored beloved Haji Siyyid Javad and the beloved of the heart Aqa Muhammad Mu??afa, upon them both be God's peace and loving-kindness, and to the rest, I extend mention and greetings. And I beseech God, exalted be His glory, on their behalf, for that which befitteth His generosity. Peace be upon thee and upon them and upon God's righteous servants.

Exalted is the Dawning-Place of verses through which mysteries were revealed in the beginning and the return. And blessings and peace be upon Him through Whom the Sun of Reality dawned upon creation and the Dove cooed upon the branch of Oneness - verily there is no God but Him, the One, the Chosen One - and upon His family and companions through whom lands were conquered and God's laws flowed among the servants, and upon those who cast aside the world, turning to God, the Lord of eternity.\n\nThereafter, it is submitted that your letter arrived and brought joy and gladness both before and after. I beseech and implore God, exalted be His glory, to enable all to attain to what He loves and is pleased with. No station has been or is higher than this station. All good belongs to whoever drinks from the ocean of His good-pleasure, turns toward His direction and faces His countenance after the passing of all things. Praise be to God that you have attained to true blessing and are sustained by heavenly sustenance. This evanescent servant wishes to offer thanks with a hundred thousand tongues to God, glorified be His majesty, for He guided the Afnan to the Divine Lote-Tree. This has been and is one of God's special favors. Now, due to current circumstances, its fruits are hidden from eyes but are reflected in the mirror of knowledge in ways that none but God can enumerate. To Him be praise and grace in all conditions.\n\nRegarding what was mentioned about Jinab-i-Harf-i-Shin (upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]), and his deeds that were recorded - this news has been written and sent from various quarters. After it was presented, they stated that his deed was accepted and the service he rendered to the Afnan is like a crown among his good works. Well done to him for what he has attained. The petitions of this evanescent servant in this regard are known and need not be expressed. Verily He hears and knows and sees, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about certain matters, namely buying and selling - the affairs of this land are known and clear to you. Act as you deem appropriate. The command is in God's hands - He does what He wills and ordains what He desires, and He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nLight, remembrance and peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.\n\nThe Servant\n\n2 Safar 1300\n\n=== END BH02313 ===\n\n=== START BH02314 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power\n\nPraise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings be upon Him Who subdued the world through His Name, the Guardian over all nations, and upon His family and companions who aided the Faith and raised its banners in the name of God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nYour esteemed letter arrived, praise be to God. It was a herald bringing news of sincerity, health and wellbeing. Yet sincerity is for God, the Truth, and health and wellbeing are for all. After offering praise and thanksgiving to the Lord, you proceeded to mention your pilgrimage. Afterwards you wrote that God willing, may you ever be favored with divine grace and steadfast in His service. We beseech God to assist all to do what is befitting and to manifest and bring to completion specific civil matters with perfect sanctity and detachment.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about the claims of certain ones - there is no doubt that the creditors are embarrassed while those who should pay show no shame on their faces. This is not new but has always been thus, hence it was said: \"A loan is scissors that cut affection.\" His honor Aqa Mirza Husayn, upon him be the Glory of God, is truly a quiet and silent person who certainly avoids matters that cause aversion and ill-feeling. However, in conducting business one must follow its proper conditions. Therefore they must keep accounts and make claims, as they themselves are in debt and payment of debts is necessary. As He, glorified and exalted be He, has said: \"The payment of debts is an urgent obligation.\" If one does not collect, they certainly cannot make payment, and even if claims are made, no one gives anything.\n\nUntil the child cries, how can it drink milk?\n\nUntil the cloud weeps, how can the meadow smile?\n\nGod willing, may the debtors be enabled to pay and the creditors to collect. Another petition: whenever you meet with the friends and loved ones of God, glorified be His majesty, mention this lowly one. This servant has ever mentioned and continues to mention each one in the Most Holy Court, and requests all to beseech God to protect this servant from error, mistake and from all that is unworthy of God. Remember the beloved one, His honor Aqa Siyyid 'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God. It is hoped that this servant too may come to those parts. God willing, whatever remains of mentions due, I take upon myself so that I may attain the presence of the friends. Peace shining from the horizon of the Abode of Peace be upon you and upon those with you and upon those who took the cup of conjecture and cast it behind them, then took again the cup of certitude and drank therefrom in the name of God, the Mighty, the Wise.

The mirror of the world has arrived with what it brought - one cup of love, one cup of affection, one cup of remembrance and praise was observed therein. After journeying and traversing through the realms of truth and investigation, and traveling through the degrees of love with precision, having aimed for that station, it was presented before His face. He said: We beseech God to protect and guard His honor Javad, upon him be peace, and to bestow upon him in every moment that which befits His generosity and bounty. Likewise we beseech God to transform the days of separation and remoteness into nearness and reunion. End.\n\nIn truth, separation from that beloved one and his absence has become the dawning-place of sorrow and the cause of grief. God is sufficient as witness that the connection of limbs and members, the sight of eyes and joy of heart are, in the first degree, from union and meeting with the loved ones. This is a bounty which is truly worthy of mention, description and praise. This evanescent servant beseeches from the Ever-Abiding Lord that which will brighten the eyes and gladden the heart. Basra came but brought no glad tidings of that beloved one's presence. I beseech God to remove the causes of delay that have intervened, so that the eyes of the friends may be brightened. The mention of that beloved one has been and continues to be in the gathering of the prisoners. In truth, from what is known, all are weary from the burden of waiting and hasty in seeking relief. God willing, soon the glad tidings will arrive and the good news of reunion will dispel the clouds from hearts. God is witness and testifier to how much joy and delight was experienced from that beloved one's letter: first, the glad tidings of that beloved one's health and well-being; second, the turning to the direction of the Goal; third, the sanctification of his honor, the beloved of the heart, Nabil, son of Nabil, from allegations and limitations. From every direction there was no wine, yet it brought exhilaration; there was no carpet, yet it spread the mat of joy. What we now beseech from God is nearness and reunion. The command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and decreeth what He pleaseth. To the honored master, his honor the Greater Afnan, his honor the Most Luminous Star Afnan, the honored beloved his honor Haji, and other loved ones, upon them be God's peace - I remember them all and send greetings.\n\nO God, my God!

The fire of Thy love hath set me ablaze and Thy remoteness and separation have destroyed me. Is there a way for me, O my God, to the fortress which Thou hast made a prison for the Manifestation of Thyself? Have I any portion in the hearing of Thy call and beholding the lights of Thy countenance? Have I any share in the waves of the ocean of Thy revelation and in standing before the gate of Thy grandeur? I know not, O my God, what Thou hast ordained for me from Thy Most Exalted Pen and Thy Will that dominates all things. Alas, alas, should Thy irrevocable decree prevent me from drawing nigh unto Thee, O Lord of the worlds and Goal of the nations! Thou seest, O my God, my sighs in Thy days and my tears in my separation and remoteness from Thee. By Thy might, O Thou Who art the ardent desire of the hearts of them who are nigh unto Thee and the hope of the hearts of the sincere ones! Should Thou chastise me through Thy power and might throughout the duration of Thy kingdom and dominion, it would be better for me than to be deprived of standing before Thy throne and prevented from that which the Interlocutor heard on the Mount of Thy knowledge. O Lord! The vibration of Thy Most Exalted Word and the breaths of the utterance of Thy Most Exalted Pen have so seized me that my hand is powerless to choose and my breast to endure. Have mercy, O Thou Who holdest the reins of existence and art the Sovereign of the seen and unseen, upon one who findeth for himself neither movement nor stillness, neither spirit nor will nor volition of his own. O Lord! This is one dead who desireth the breaths of Thy revelation and what would give him life through the eternity of Thy might and sovereignty; and this is one non-existent who seeketh existence from the heaven of Thy bounty and the sea of Thy generosity and the sun of Thy grace; and this is one poor whom Thou seest clinging to the hem of Thy riches and holding fast to the cord of Thy bestowals; and a sinner who desireth the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and one deaf who desireth to hear Thy most sweet call which hath been raised from the direction of Thy prison. I beseech Thee, O Lord of creation and Originator of invention, by the breezes that wafted at the dawn of Thy manifestation and the fragrances of Thy verses, to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy generosity that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and acquaint me with Thy momentous Message and Thy straight Path. By Thy might, O Lord of Names and Creator of heaven! My deeds in Thy days and my remembrances at the time of Thy remembrance have grieved me. I am the one, O my God, whom Thou didst mention by Thy Most Exalted Pen when I was heedless of Thy remembrance, O Lord of Names, and Thou wert turning toward me when I was hesitant in Thy Cause, O King of earth and heaven! I beseech Thee to expiate my grievous transgressions and mighty sins, and purify me from that which is not befitting for Thy days, O Thou by the movement of Whose finger all created things were set in motion! I beseech Thee in this my station, by Thy mercy which hath preceded all created things and by Thy grace which hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, to confirm me in rending asunder the veils of glory and the veils of fancy which have prevented me from turning toward Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the kingdom of names!

All things lament for what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty from the nations, while He Himself is in manifest joy. We have taken, in Our Most Exalted Name, the cup of tribulation and drink thereof in My Name, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Through tribulation have We adorned the Cause in the kingdom of creation, yet the people remain in a mighty veil. In every moment there befalleth Us what hath befallen no one before, yet the mercy of God, the Almighty, the Powerful, hath preceded His wrath. Can anyone prevent Us from what We desire? Nay, by the Lord of the Exalted Throne! Had We found in the world any good or permanence, We would not have left it to Our enemies. This word sufficeth Our discerning servants. O loved ones of God and His chosen ones! Seize what remaineth of your days. Beware lest ye squander it. Turn ye unto God and what ye have been commanded, then seek this grace which hath shone forth from the horizon of justice with manifest sovereignty. Say: This is a sun whom clouds cannot obscure, and a moon whom veils cannot eclipse, and a light whom the veils of those who have disbelieved in God, the One, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, cannot prevent. How many servants have risen against Us in tyranny - We seized them through a power from Us and made them among the perished ones. Where are they who dwelt in palaces and reclined upon the cushions of pride? By My life, We returned them to their graves in manifest sorrow. Where is he who built Al-Khawarnaq? Where is he who warred against the Truth? Where is Pharaoh and his hosts, and Nimrod and his might? We seized them all after We had sent unto them the Prophets and Messengers. Say: O people! What hath made you heedless of God, and by what reason have ye turned away from His face after He came with the truth in His great glory? He desired naught for you save that ye should turn unto Him and draw near to the glorious horizon. Ye have occupied yourselves with passion and turned away from what is better for you from the Lord of the First and the Last. Fear God, then have mercy upon yourselves and follow not every sinful oppressor. O thou who gazest toward the direction of the Cause! Guide the people unto this Straight Path, then cast upon them the word whereby We have distinguished between all creatures. Beware lest the waters of rejection from those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, extinguish thee. If thou findest one athirst, be as water unto him, and if thou findest one hungry for the knowledge of God, nourish him with what We have sent down from the heaven of oneness - the eternal feast - that he may know and thank his Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wise. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who limiteth affairs to the remembrance of his Lord and calleth the people unto this luminous horizon. The glory from Us be upon thee and upon those who are with thee among My loved ones, from one mighty and beautiful.

You have interpreted what you interpreted regarding your standing before the Gate and your presence in the seats of grandeur at the right hand of the Tree of Eternity, where upon the shore of the Divine Identity was planted the pavilion of the cloud, and the words of your Lord were fulfilled in the atmosphere of these allusions, and the meanings of your Creator's melody were defined in the inner essence of these symbols. And you, bear witness for yourself as I bore witness then for you that you obeyed God in all conditions and did not disobey Him and will never disobey Him should He will and desire. And there shall appear to you what was concealed in your heart, and there shall descend upon you what was ordained for you, for in His hand is the Kingdom of might and power, and He is powerful over all things.\n\nThe corner of the tavern of divine love is the resting place of the soul's abode, for the delicate, subtle soul soars only in the atmosphere of the Beloved and finds no dwelling place except the gathering place of the Friend. One must arise and advance with all one's soul and spirit to give thanks at all times to this Cupbearer of the wine of immortality. The meaning of this thanksgiving is a thanksgiving that purifies the ear from hearing outward lute and harp, that it may perceive the holy, spiritual melodies, and prevents the eye from beholding ephemeral, darkened outer beauty, that it may receive its portion from beholding the beauty of the Divine Identity. Blessed is the ear that heareth from this divine Royal Falcon the celestial royal strain, and from this Iraqi Countenance heareth the melodies of mighty Hijaz, until his whole body becometh a spirit and his entire frame the dwelling and abode of the Beloved. But, I swear by God, none heareth and no soul perceiveth, for this divine flute needeth a plectrum of the essence of spirit, and this eternal harp requireth the melody of light - not these remote souls who have never tasted the wine of nearness nor drunk the water of reunion from the matchless fountain. They possess naught but pure fancy and find no eternal life save utter extinction. They have become slaves to self and remained cut off from the King of Kings; they have become servants of the body and remained heedless and veiled from the Lord of Lords. But O Taqi, the breeze of thy love is sweeter than morning prayers, and thy sin more beloved than asking forgiveness. It was intended that all these stations be explained, but what was decreed has come to pass and therefore is complete and ended. For if all on earth were freed from veils, this single page would suffice them all, and all spiritual meanings are hidden as pearls in this divine ocean. Blessed are those servants who succeed in obtaining its pearls.\n\n=== END BH02318 ===\n\n=== START BH02319 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty! O Letter M! Hear My call and be not of the heedless ones.

Say: O peoples of the earth! By God the Truth, this is indeed a Dove that calleth out at all times and feareth none save God, the Lord of the worlds. It turneth not toward any soul nor regardeth any that are in the heavens or on earth, for whoso turneth toward God will never turn to aught else - such is the way of the sincere ones. Alas for you, O people of the earth, that ye have been heedless of these days and were among the negligent ones. Ye have not heard the melodies of the Spirit - and this indeed is a grievous heedlessness. Say: They who were not present in that land were in manifest loss. Know then that God hath ordained this migration for a wisdom none knoweth save God, the Mighty, the Wise. O people of the Bayan, grieve not over this, but put your trust in God - in Him let them that profess His unity place their trust. Then make mention from Us to those servants who have been patient in God and were among the patient ones. And the Spirit be upon you, O loved ones of God, and upon those who were steadfast in the Cause.\n\nFurthermore, We make mention of the divine friends. The promised Bird that was sent in the tablets of Muhammad-'Ali hath now taken flight and sought the heights of nearness. While time remained, none perceived it and all were heedless. We are God's and to Him do we return. Now I counsel all that, God willing, they may hereafter move in perfect unity and remain steadfast in the Cause, discerning with insight between truth and falsehood, for truth is as manifest from falsehood as the radiant morn from the dark night. Let them not cling to their own suppositions. Though truth be bitter, yet God willing, I hope it will prove sweeter than honey to their taste. This is of God's grace unto whomsoever He willeth. These very tribulations suffice as a reminder to all. God is the Guide, and verily He guideth the way.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the aforementioned matter, no word hath reached Us from you. In any case, if Aqa Murtada-Quli and the heirs of the deceased are acting according to the will and sending any funds, let them send them to Aqa Siyyid Mahdi-i-Yazdi in Baghdad. As debts have also accumulated in this land, we have therefore left the Siyyid and appointed him trustee over affairs and payment of debts.

This is thy station and what God hath ordained for thee. Hold thou fast unto it. He will assist thee under all conditions.

At all times fix thy gaze upon this exalted and most high station. Most people have been prevented from the Lord of Days by their vain imaginings. Thou must strive to rend asunder these thick veils. The Most Great Elixir and the Crown of Victory have been and shall ever be the love of the Dayspring of the Light of Oneness. Thou must bestow this sacred elixir, which transcendeth description, upon the base metals of contingent beings, that all may attain the golden station which is the kingdom of things, and be honored with pure gold which is the station of divine recognition.\n\nThy call was heard and thy purpose became known. However, what God hath chosen for thee is what was mentioned, and what God hath chosen, it behooveth thee to choose for thyself. He is verily the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

For His grace has preceded and His mercy has encompassed all. And whatever appears from the Source of the Cause of the Lord of Destiny, all must be content and thankful for it. For the decree of prohibition has not been and will not be for those who have accepted, rather it has been due to the turning away of the deniers and the protection of the Cause of the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nObserve that this servant has been among the claimants of love day and night, and at all times has summoned all to the horizon of the All-Merciful. Nevertheless it bore no fruit, as you have seen and heard that the new denier, despite the perfection of grace and favor manifested toward him from the Dawning-Place of the Manifestation, did not appreciate it and finally arose in a sin greater than the creation of the heavens and earth. The more perfect the manifestation of favors, the greater his turning away. He never observed the rights of God, and arose in such wickedness and enmity that nothing above it can be imagined. Fie upon him and his faithfulness! For successive years he was occupied in disbelief and mockery of the Messengers of God. Nevertheless We concealed it until he rent asunder the veil of honor with fingers of hatred. Therefore We banished him from the door. Verily thy Lord is He Who judgeth at the beginning and the end.\n\nYour honor should not be saddened by this new prohibition. In all cases be content with the good-pleasure of God. Although patience is bitter, yet by the command of the Friend it is sweet and blessed. It is incumbent upon those who have accepted to be content with the good-pleasure of the Friend and to be found submissive and obedient at the dawning of the divine Sun of the Cause. If the outward door is closed, the inward door is open. Verily He is with whomsoever desireth Him and He is the Protector of those who have accepted. We beseech God to remove what hath come between us and to send down from the heaven of His sovereignty that whereby the lights of His countenance may shine forth from the horizon of His mighty and wondrous Cause. Praise be to God that thou dwellest in His vicinity and art at rest in His shadow. Verily He seeth thee in all conditions. Verily He perceiveth all eyes and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH02321 ===\n\n=== START BH02322 ===\n\nIn the Name of our Most Holy, Most Great, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Lord!\n\nThe essence of praise, the quintessence of glorification, and the pure crystal of thanksgiving befitteth the most holy and most mighty court of that Beloved One Who hath given His loved ones to drink of the most pure water of life and established them in service to His Cause, that they might, with the utmost joy and fragrance and with supreme steadfastness, perfume the world with the sweet savors of the utterance of the All-Merciful. These are servants whose praise and glorification God hath sent down in His Books, His Scriptures, His Scrolls and His Tablets. These are they whom the concerns of creation have not prevented from turning unto Him and arising to serve Him.

Aid Thy loved ones to celebrate Thy praise and glorify Thee in such wise as to raise thereby the standards of Thy Cause. O Lord!

God willing that beloved one will exert the utmost effort to ensure their arrival - the sooner they arrive the better. I beseech God to confirm that honored one in service to His Cause. Praise be to God, you have been and are confirmed, and ere long its effects shall become manifest. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good to be lost.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this evanescent servant is sending a letter in reply to your honored missive. Its delay until now has been a cause of embarrassment, and it has happened again that while this servant was occupied outside the prison with sending replies to the correspondence of the two aforementioned persons, the reply to that beloved one had been written earlier and remained in the city, and there was no opportunity for this servant to arrange and send it. Hope for pardon has been and is present. God willing it will be sent on another occasion. A missive from His Holiness the Most Great Branch - may my spirit, my being, and my essence be a sacrifice for the dust of His most pure footsteps - was penned specifically for that beloved one and has been sent.\n\nTo all the loved ones and friends in that land who have drunk from the cup of steadfastness and are gazing toward the horizon of the Cause, I convey greetings, and for all I beseech from God, exalted be His glory, divine confirmations and assistance.

Bear thou witness that no God is there but Him, He who pronounceth at all times that I am God, there is none other God but Me, verily, I am, at all times independent of the entire creation. He revealed Himself unto thee once in the Realm of Glory, then once in the contingent world and the heavenly kingdom, then yet again during these days whence the lights west of the Sacred Realm are aglow, and with their radiance have illumined the denizens of the cities of eternity, and the Concourse of high, and thereafter them who set within themselves their path towards His Countenance. Go thou straight on and persevere in that which the Pen of God, in truth, commandeth thee, and remain upon the straight path of God, steadfast in His Cause.\n\nSay: Verily, this is the straight path of God upon earth and heaven, and His Testimony in the kingdoms of Revelation and creation. He was named \"Ali\" amongst the people of the Bayan, and then Muhammad amongst the people of the Qur'an, and, in ancient times, was named with each one of the most excellent names of God. Thus does the Tongue of power and might counsel you with Verses that have embraced all mankind, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and convey unto all people the glad tidings of this Announcement, hitherto concealed from the world, and proclaim unto all men that which we have proclaimed unto thee in this Tablet, and bid them to turn with justice towards the Most Exalted Throne. Say, the Truth proclaimeth; By God! No created thing having His love can ever be harmed. Verily, He is the Spring that floweth from the well-spring of a Name that is great indeed. Whosoever drinketh therefrom shall fear no one, and heaven and earth cannot withstand him. Thus hath the sacred Pen of glory irrevocably decreed.\n\nBe thou steadfast in the Cause of God, and in that which hath been prescribed unto thee, and fear no one. Place thy trust in Him, He verily shall protect thee from every plotting sinful one. By God! Whosoever hath the love of this Youth in his heart, God shall verily render him victorious over all who dwell upon earth and heaven, and verily God shall be the witness thereof. He shall walk upon water as he waketh upon the earth, and shall soar in the realm of the Spirit in the limitless expanse of heaven.

All praise be to Thee for having enabled me to hearken to Thy call, for having honored me with Thy footsteps, and for having quickened my soul through the vitalizing fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when the hour at which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike, Thou didst breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation shook to its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden within the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created things.\"\n\nNo sooner had her voice reached that most exalted Spot than We made reply: \"Render thanks unto Thy Lord, O Carmel.

Neither the opposition of rulers nor the clamor of divines could deter Him from His mighty, all-conquering purpose. The intention was that they might attain, through the traces of the Most Exalted Pen, unto the fruits of the divine Lote-Tree, and that these two fleeting days might not deprive the servants of the eternal divine Kingdom. The ocean of utterance surgeth at all times, and the Sun of Truth ever shineth from the horizon of the heaven of manifestation. The verses have been sent down in such wise that the Pen is powerless to reckon them, and the evidences are manifest. Yet all remain veiled and deprived, save whom God willeth.\n\nO thou who gazest upon His countenance! Reflect upon the previous community. For twelve hundred years and more, not a single one of the divines became aware of that Essence of Being in the loins. They attained not a drop from the ocean of knowledge. They took mere fancy for certitude and sheer conjecture for knowledge. They were enslaved by vain imaginings while counting themselves among the people of divine unity. On the Day of Reckoning, the fruit of the deeds of those heedless souls was that they pronounced sentence against the Lord of all worlds and martyred Him. Reflect thou upon this matter, for reflection on such matters increaseth knowledge, and the lights of the Sun of Certitude shine forth without veil or covering and are witnessed. Now certain ones among the people of the Bayan follow in the footsteps of the previous community. We see them as more lost than these, though they know it not. Today the world is illumined and hath attained unto the lights of true divine unity. Whosoever attaineth unto this findeth himself free and detached from the world and all who dwell therein.

When thou findest the fragrance of the All-Merciful's utterance and art attracted by the breezes of revelation, say:\n\nMy God, my God! Thou seest me advancing toward Thee, standing before the door of Thy grandeur, and gazing toward the horizon of Thy grace. I beseech Thee, by Thy Cause that hath subdued the heavens and earth, and by Thy Name whereby Thou hast subjected all who are in the kingdom of creation, and by the Ship that hath sailed on land and sea, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall immortalize my remembrance in Thy Scriptures and Tablets. Thou seest, O my God, the hands of hope upraised toward the heaven of Thy favor. Ordain for me that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and profit me in every world of Thy worlds.

The clamor of princes and the whisperings of divines did not hold Him back from manifesting His Cause before the faces of all parties. Before all faces He spoke the blessed word \"He doeth what He willeth.\" The power of the world did not weaken His might, nor did the oppression of nations prevent His Word from penetrating. In the trials that befell Him and the tribulations that descended, He held fast to the cord of patience, His purpose being to extinguish, through loving counsels and wise admonitions, the fire of hatred between the various peoples, so that the light of the words \"on thrones facing one another\" might illumine the horizons with the light of unity and concord.\n\nO Afnan!

However, if there is suitable accommodation and means in Port Said, we can send his eminence Aqa Siyyid Taqi, upon him be the glory of God, to you as well so that you may be together. The prohibition regarding Port Said was in consideration of your being alone, lest you become disheartened. Otherwise it is quite clear and evident that you are joyful and act according to whatever is commanded. Now too, as commanded, consult - if it is deemed advisable we will send his eminence Aqa Siyyid Taqi to you to be a companion to your honor and an assistant in your work, or you may proceed to Alexandria. Both options are adorned with the ornament of permission and good-pleasure.

Fear not the divine decree and be content with His good pleasure. Consider not this migration as abasement, but rather know it as the source of eternal glory. I swear by the Sun of Grandeur that were people to become aware of even less than can be counted, all would sacrifice their souls and spirits in the path of the Friend. Consider the wine of divine trials as a bounty - this cup is not the portion of every soul, but rather the share of those who have attained and the portion of those drawn nigh. Praise be to God that you remained preserved from the tribulation of grievous days which was recorded in the tablets of preservation, and turned toward the direction of the Beloved. Consider it a bounty to remain settled in that land, and with utmost tranquility recline upon the cushions of certitude, preserving yourself from the whisperings of the Evil One who is engaged in suggesting doubts among the people. Place your trust in the Truth and turn away from all else, hold fast to the cord of His grace and detach yourself from all besides Him. In these days the earthly satans have appeared in different forms, as was mentioned in a previous tablet. O emigrant! The divine verses are distinguished from all else - all that is mentioned and concealed between the heavens and earth cannot equal a single word thereof. Now observe the words of others, that you may become illumined and enlightened by the Sun of meanings which hath dawned from the horizon of divine utterances, and become independent of all else. The Truth was with you at the time when that polytheist was casting doubts in your heart. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, He knoweth what is manifest and what is hidden, and He is indeed knowing of all things. Let not your illumined heart be veiled by the allusions in the words of the polytheists and the objections of the hypocrites. For today if books were to appear equal in number to the leaves of the trees, and from them the fragrance of the love of this Youth were not inhaled, they would not be mentioned or accepted in the presence of God. O emigrant servant! Drink the pure water of meanings and knowledge from the hands of the people of Baha. I swear by the Truth that with but a drop thereof thou wouldst find thyself independent of all else besides God. Mention of these days and their trials hath been recorded in the Tablet of Proofs which was sent down from the heaven of oneness addressed to the maternal uncle, and likewise in other tablets. Should you now observe them, you would become aware of certain mysteries.

His call was raised in the nights and His lamentation in the early dawn, and His cry during the days. In the heavenly Books, according to what some of the parties have mentioned and continue to mention, there was the burning of books and the slaying of souls and the prevention of unity, which is the greatest means for the progress of the servants and the advancement of lands...\n\nIn my childhood, this wronged one read in a book by Mulla Baqir Majlisi about the raid on the Banu Qurayzah. From that moment I was distressed and full of sorrow, to the extent that my pen cannot express it -- even though what happened was the decree of God, and its intent was only to foil oppressors.\n\nBut when the ocean of forgiveness and grace appeared, therefore in those days I beseeched God for that which was the cause of love, fellowship and unity among all who are on earth -- until, on the second of the month of the Birth before the Dawning, all my mental states, my words and thoughts, were turned upside down, an inversion that bore the glad-tidings of the Ascent. This revolution was manifest for twelve days continuously and unremittingly. Afterwards, the waves of the ocean of utterance appeared, and the effulgences of the luminary of tranquillity were radiant. Then the matter eventuated in a time of full revelation (zuhu:r), when I attained to that which God rendered the basis of the joy of the worlds and the dawn of bestowal on all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. After the Most High Pen \\[Qalam-i A'la=the Bab\\], We abrogated all that which was the cause of hardship and discomfort and strife by Our decisive decree, and We revealed and implemented all that which was a source of concord and unity. No one denies the grace inherent in this revelation save those who are veiled and heedless, and the despised tyrants.\n\nThe revealed holy Tablets and the Tablet of the Call testify and bear witness. Blessed are the fair-minded and blessed is every truthful and trustworthy one. When thou hast heard My call from My Tablet and beheld what hath shone forth from its horizon as a token of My grace, say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having caused me to hear Thy call and for having acquainted me with that which was hidden in Thy knowledge and concealed from the eyes of Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O Sovereign of existence and Ruler of the seen and unseen, to assist me to remember Thee and to serve Thee and to serve Thy loved ones.

We make mention in this station of thy family and relatives and send Our greetings upon them all, male and female, as a favor from Us. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous.\n\nAnd We make mention of her who ascended to the Supreme Companion and attained the meeting when the Sun was shining from the horizon of Baghdad. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And We have mentioned the Perfect One time after time and have sent down that which brings joy to the eyes of those near to God. Convey greetings to all from the True One, and the word of forgiveness has been sent down for those who have ascended. Verily He forgives as He wishes and bestows as He desires. There is no God but He, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The glory be upon thee and upon thy brother and upon those who have attained to this mighty station.\n\n=== END BH02330 ===\n\n=== START BH02331 ===\n\nHe is the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nHis remembrance from the Wronged One is unto all who are in the world, that He may draw them nigh unto God when He came with manifest sovereignty and revealed that which was hidden in the Books of old and treasured in the hearts of the Messengers. This is He through Whom the ocean of knowledge surged in creation and the light of unity shone forth from His luminous horizon. But for Him, the Books would not have been revealed nor would the pearls of wisdom have appeared from the sea of knowledge. To this testifieth every perceiving scholar. O 'Ali-Naqi! Behold and then recall what the people of the Bayan uttered when the All-Merciful came with a manifest light. They broke God's covenant and His pledge, clinging to the promptings of Satan. Say: By God! The Bayan circleth round Me, and the Point lamenteth by reason of what hath befallen Me at the hands of the aggressive ones who cast the Book of God behind their backs and spoke that which none of the ancients ever spoke. They have taken their calumnies as a shield unto themselves that they might lead people astray from the path of God. Nay, they perceive it not. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear the All-Merciful and follow not your own selves. Follow Him Who hath come with the hosts of divine inspiration from the horizon of the heaven of your Lord's power, the Self-Subsisting. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth, and He is the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. Whoso saith 'why' or 'wherefore' hath indeed disbelieved in God and His signs. To this the Books of old do testify, but most of the people understand not. O Pen! Leave their mention and make mention of Thy loved ones in Ra and Shin, and give them the glad-tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of existence. O people of God! Ye have heard the Call when it was raised from the land of Zawra and from the Land of Mystery, and in this praiseworthy station. Blessed is the light whom veils have not deterred and the strong one whom hosts and armies have not weakened.\n\nO 'Ali-Naqi! Hearken unto the divine Call in the Persian tongue, that all may attain to their goal and not be deprived of the fragrances of the Day of God. The loved ones of God have ever been beneath the glance of His loving-kindness. We beseech God to aid all to that which befitteth these days. O people of God! Be not grieved. By the life of God! There hath been ordained for you that which the eye of creation hath not seen the like thereof. In most Tablets We have commanded all to perform goodly deeds and manifest spiritual attributes. Blessed are they who have arisen to assist the Cause through the hosts of deeds and character. They are God's loved ones amidst His creatures. We beseech God, exalted be He, to forgive you and ordain for you that which shall profit you in all His worlds. Verily He is potent over all things and worthy to answer. May He send down upon you His blessings and ordain for you attendance before His presence or the reward of meeting Him. Verily He is the Compassionate, the Generous. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH02331 ===\n\n=== START BH02332 ===\n\nO ?. Abu'l-Hasan in Shin! He is the Sovereign! Glorified is He Who sendeth down in every season that which purifieth the hearts of them that have recognized Him, and uttereth at all times verses that leave powerless all in the world. The Revelation in this Dispensation hath attained such a station that were all who are in the heavens and on earth to gather together to enumerate that which hath been sent down from it, by God, thou wouldst behold them utterly powerless. Say: O servant, woe unto every sinful denier who, when he heareth the verses of the Spirit, his face darkeneth with rancor and he turneth away therefrom, and waxeth proud before God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Say: By God, such grace hath been manifested in a manner that none can conceal it, if ye be of them that are discerning. And among the people is he who saith \"I have believed in God and His verses,\" yet when the verses of the Spirit are recited unto him, he persisteth in pride as though he heard them not, and shaketh his head in mockery before God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And among them are those who, when they hear God's verses, their eyes overflow with tears out of their love for God, the Single, the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say: O people, fear ye God and differ not among yourselves, lest the hearts of the deniers rejoice thereat. Be as one soul in upholding the Cause, then aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate, though He is in truth independent of the help of all in the heavens and earth, if ye be of them that are endued with insight. He commandeth His servants to render aid that they may thereby detach themselves from all else but Him and turn towards a holy and luminous direction. And thou, O believer in God, remind the servants of that wherewith We have reminded thee, and place thy trust in God, thy Lord, and be of them that trust. Fear thou no one and be not troubled by anything, even shouldst thou witness all who are in the heavens and on earth turning away in manifest rejection. Know thou that God hath prescribed mercy for Himself, that He will aid those who have patience, seeking His face, and cut off the last remnant of them that disbelieved and were of the idolaters. Soon shalt thou witness thy Lord's triumph, whereby His Cause shall be raised to such a station that before it shall bow the necks of the proud ones. Thus do We make mention unto thee in truth and cast upon thee that which purifieth thy spirit and expandeth thy breast and consoleth thine eyes, that thou mayest give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for this bounty which shall never cease unto all eternity. Then remind the servants not to follow every ignorant rabble and every sinner remote from this Kawthar which floweth from the right hand of a mighty Throne. Know thou moreover that We have arrived in a Prison which none can reach save through mighty effort and determination, and thereby have been severed from Our hem the hands of both those that have turned towards Us and those that have turned away, except whom thy Lord willeth, the All-Conquering, the Almighty, the Most Compassionate. And the Spirit be upon thee and upon him that hath shown gratitude and patience, and We are in manifest thankfulness.\n\n=== END BH02332 ===\n\n=== START BH02333 ===\n\nTo one of the Afnan, his honor Buzurg:\n\nUpon thee be the splendor of God and His glory! Rejoice that thy name is oft-mentioned before the Throne. Say: Praise be to Thee, O our Lord, the All-Merciful! Thou, while in prison, dost remember those who love Thee and call out to those who seek Thee. I testify that Thy mercy hath encompassed all creation. O Lord! Withhold not the glances of Thy loving-kindness from this servant whose gaze is fixed upon Thy most exalted horizon. Preserve him, then, beneath the shade of the Tree of Thy grace. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nKnow thou that there hath come before Our presence a leaf from the Afnan which We found adorned with the ornament of love for thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Blessed is he in that he hath been mentioned before the Throne and the tongue of Revelation hath spoken in his remembrance words of light that have shone forth from the horizon of the favors of thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Remember him on My behalf and say: Should thou ask of the Prisoner, verily He is in the hands of the wicked, and at all times His tongue doth make mention of His Lord and there descendeth from the heaven of Command that which giveth life unto souls. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Qiblih of all horizons and for having been encompassed by the grace of thy Lord, the Creator of all things. Say: O people! The Day hath come - the Kingdom is God's, the One, the Almighty. Doth it beseem anyone to tarry when every rock proclaimeth with loudest voice: Hasten with your hearts unto the Dayspring of grandeur and power!\n\nGive thanks unto God for having adorned thee with the ornament of His love and clothed thee in the raiment of righteousness, which is the recognition of the Manifestation of His Cause, whereby the standards of remembrance have been raised upon the highest mountains. Know thou that upon Our arrival at this Spot, We chose to designate it as the \"Most Great Prison\". Though previously subjected in another land (Tehran) to chains and fetters, We yet refused to call it by that name. Say: Ponder thereon, O ye endued with understanding! All that hath appeared and will appear hath been recorded in the Book. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Among the people are those who recognize Him before His manifestation, and among them are those who, when He is made manifest, say: \"This is what hath proceeded from the Pen of Revelation from God, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving.\" Blessed is he who pondereth the verses of God and readeth them at eventide and at dawn.\n\nWe beseech God to make thee steadfast in His Cause in such wise that thou seest all else beneath thy shadow. This beseemeth one who hath laid hold on the Most Great Cord, by whose movement all creation hath been moved. O My Afnan! We love to remember you by night and by day. Blessed is he who hath aided Me and hath arisen to serve his Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Rejoice and be glad on this Day wherein the veil hath been rent asunder and that which was hidden in God's knowledge from time immemorial hath been made manifest. Convey My greetings unto the face of him who loveth Me. Verily thy Lord remembereth whom He willeth through His grace. His grace hath indeed preceded creation. Upon thee be My glory and the glory of all things unto the Day that shall not be followed by reckoning.\n\n=== END BH02333 ===\n\n=== START BH02334 ===\n\nO Mirza Rida-Quli\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the Most Powerful\n\nIt has been a long time since the breezes of love have wafted from your direction, and this servant, mindful of prudence, has made no expression. Yet the sublime Truth bears witness that love for you has dwelled in my heart and mention of you upon my tongue. We beseech God that through His grace you may arise to serve His Cause, detached from all else. This is what endures in the Kingdom of your Lord; all else shall perish. The days have passed - we must spend what remains in service to the Beloved of the worlds.\n\nIf you ask about this servant's condition - never before has any Manifestation of the Divine Unity been imprisoned together with seventy souls. From this you can imagine what has transpired and continues to transpire. Yet through divine grace and heavenly favor, We shine forth from the horizon of tribulation, summoning all to the Truth. Whatever befalls Us has been and will be beloved. We beseech God to aid Us to remain steadfast in His Cause and love, for He is the Protector of the sincere ones. Pray that We may meet one day, so that hidden matters may be witnessed unveiled.\n\nConvey My greetings to those who circle round. Tell your sister that if her lack of love stems from love for Yahya, God and all in the heavens and earth bear witness that you had and have no knowledge of his cause, and whatever you have heard was all due to wisdom. Even now, if you reflect purely for the sake of God on what is mentioned, you will become certain. In any case, your lack of love has had no cause. Setting all else aside, it is not befitting to break the covenant of love due to the suppositions of deluded souls. Hear the call of this Wronged One and speak with fairness. I beseech God to aid you to be just and not to deprive you of the spiritual waters of mercy flowing from the heaven of divine grace. What is mentioned is for God's sake - this is most evident. This servant has fallen into a barren valley where tribulations have reached such a state that no good decreases them and no evil increases them. We praise God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, in all conditions. God willing, We hope you will break the chains of imitation with the strength of certitude and enter the pleasant expanse of detachment. This intensity and that ease shall both soon pass away - what endures is steadfastness in love and faithfulness. Thus has the All-Merciful testified in the Tablets. We beseech God to aid you in what He loves and is pleased with. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\n=== END BH02334 ===\n\n=== START BH02335 ===\n\nO my God! I call upon Thee when calamities descend from the clouds of Thy decree and tribulations rain down from the heavens of Thy command. How long wilt Thou make us drink from the cups of joy in Thy dominion, and how long wilt Thou provide us with the chalice of sorrow among Thy servants? Have the rains of Thy bounty ceased to pour, though I witness them still flowing in Thy lands? Have the gates of Thy mercy and favor been sealed, though I see them still open before Thy creation?\n\nBy Thy might, O my Beloved! The drink of Thy lovers has become their hearts' blood, and the food of Thy faithful ones the pieces of their livers. Days pass over them without the breezes of Thy mercy wafting upon them, and nights elapse without the fragrances of Thy loving-kindness reaching them. Dost Thou, O my God, bar them from the shores of Thy mighty ocean after they have confessed Thy oneness? Dost Thou, O my Lord, drive them from the precincts of Thy sanctity after they have acknowledged Thy unity?\n\nGlory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee, O my Heart's Desire! Tribulation has reached such a state that it gives us no respite even to draw breath, encompassing us from all directions and seizing us with mighty force. By Thy might, O my God! I am bewildered in mentioning Thy descending trials and falling afflictions. I know not of which tribulation to complain to Thee.\n\nShall I complain, O my God, of my imprisonment for known months, or of the chains whose weight has broken my neck, or the iron upon my feet? Of what the hands of the wicked have wrought, or how our families were made captive in the hands of enemies, or how they seized our possessions and destroyed our homes? Or shall I recall, O my God, when they took me and led me from village to city, my head bare and my feet unshod, my neck in chains and my hands bound? Then the people gathered around me - some who knew me and some who did not. Those who knew me stood bewildered at my plight, some mocking me, while those who knew me not all cast at me whatever stones and sticks they could find, as though they had never drunk the wine of equity nor caught the fragrance of fellowship.\n\nBy Thy Ancient Beauty and the wondrous lights of Thy countenance! They inflicted upon me that which I am ashamed to mention before Thee, which the pen cannot move to describe, nor ink flow to express, nor tablet bear, nor souls endure. Therefore I cease with this, O my God. Or shall I mention how they drove us out with our women and children from our homeland - and Thou hast counted all that befell and descended upon us - or what occurred to us thereafter, or this fresh calamity and unprecedented tribulation that has grieved hearts, disturbed souls, broken backs, and constricted breasts?\n\nSince all this has come to pass through Thy irrevocable decree and decisive command, I beseech Thee by Thy luminous Beauty and Thy manifest Glory to make us patient in the occasions of Thy trials and tranquil in the places of Thy decree. For Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Glorious, the Omnipotent.\n\nThou knowest, O my God, that my complaint before Thee is but as the yearnings of lovers before their Beloved, for they desire not to complain of what they have witnessed in the paths of love and separation, or of how they have been consumed by the fire of longing. Rather, their purpose and hope is to demonstrate their sincerity before the Beloved and to prove their steadfastness in what has befallen them in the paths of affection and love, that it might serve as testimony for the lovers who will come after them upon this path.\n\nGlory be unto Thee, O my God and my Beloved! By Thy might! I find no sweetness save in the descent of Thy trials, and I behold no glory except in the appearance of Thy tribulations. May necks be deprived that have not been placed in chains of retribution in the paths of Thy good-pleasure, and may hearts perish that have not tasted the wine of afflictions in the desert of Thy love and favor, after Thou didst promise us all this in Thy inviolable Book, saying - and Thy word is the truth: \"We shall surely test you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth, lives, and fruits; but give glad tidings to the patient - those who, when affliction strikes them, say: 'Verily, we belong to God and to Him do we return.' These are they upon whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy; these are they who are guided aright.\"\n\n=== END BH02335 ===\n\n=== START BH02336 ===\n\nIn the name of the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious! The springtime of divine revelation has come, and the Sovereign of verses has been established upon the throne with a dominion that has encompassed all created things. By God! The musk of utterance has diffused such fragrance that all existence, both seen and unseen, has been perfumed thereby. To this bears witness the Concourse on High and then those who have sought shelter beneath the shade of My Most Glorious Name. Thus has the Command been sent down from God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O people! Cast aside what you possess and take hold of that which God, the Sovereign, the Most High, the Most Great, has commanded you. Verily this is the pure wine of reunion for those who have turned to God, and the dawning-place of hopes for all who are in the heavens and on earth. This indeed is the Most Great Proof among the nations and the Most Straight Path for all who possess clear vision. Blessed are you, O people of Baha! Take the cup in the name of your Most Exalted Lord and drink therefrom at all times. Verily it will make you independent of all else. Say: When the Hour came and the verses were sent down, faces turned away from their Lord, the Possessor of all attributes. Among them were those held back by vanities, and those prevented by learning, and those who said \"I have a sealed book bearing God's seal, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\" Say: O rejected one! Were We to accept what you claim, We would say: By God! Even if you possessed all the scriptures of those gone before and those yet to come, they would profit you not at all except through this Book from which has been detailed the Preserved Tablet. And were all the Dawning-Places of Revelation to hesitate in this Cause at this moment when the Tongue of Grandeur and Glory speaks, even for less than an instant, their deeds would be rendered vain. Thus has the matter been decreed by the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Say: You have not recognized this Revelation. By God! It cannot be compared with what has come or will come. To this testify near-stationed servants. Were We to mention to you the station of this Revelation, you would fall senseless at once. Verily the Cause is concealed behind a veil of light. Blessed are the people who know. Say: O heedless one! You who have not been awakened by God's call nor stirred by the breezes of revelation. We see you among the denizens of the graves. Thus have We detailed the verses that you might know what every unknown man has spoken. Arise to serve God and aid His Cause, and place your trust in Him. He protects whom He wishes through His sovereignty. There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Beloved. Verily the Glory be upon you and upon those who have drunk the choice sealed wine through this Hidden Name. Blessed art thou for having drunk the wine of reunion and attained to the mention of thy Lord amongst His servants, and recognized that which every renowned scholar was prevented from knowing. We have mentioned thee before and mention thee now through grace. Be thou assured in God, the Lord of existence. We beseech God to give the servants to drink, through thee, the wine of turning to Him, that they might recognize Him Who has come with the truth with manifest sovereignty.

Hasten unto Him with your hearts, for thus have ye been commanded in all the Tablets from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Say: This is He for Whose sake the Exalted One sacrificed His life, would ye but know it. This is He Who was mentioned in all the Tablets and Who was treasured in God's Scriptures - the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beloved. Through Him were the heavens of utterance adorned with the suns of wisdom and exposition, to which the All-Merciful Himself beareth witness, even should ye deny it.

Exalted be thy Lord, the All-Merciful, Who hath manifested from all creation that which was inscribed in the preserved Tablets of glory. Grieve not for those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God, and pay no heed to them. Turn away from them and set thy face toward God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Loving. Those who remain heedless of this Cause are nourished at the breast of idle fancy - how can they attain unto this most exalted station? Thus hath it been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen, that perchance the people may return unto the seat of the Command. Say: With Us is the knowledge of the heavens and earth.

Say: If ye wish to test your Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, then ask Him concerning the sciences ye possess, that ye may be assured within yourselves that the reins of knowledge are in the grasp of His power. With Him are sciences of which no one hath learned a single letter save God alone. Fear God, O people, and transgress not.

All things have been created for the meeting with God, yet when He appeared, every idolator and infidel denied Him, save those whom God preserved through His grace and aided to turn towards the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. The meeting hath diverse degrees - thus hath the matter been decreed in the Book. Among the people are those who attained the presence yet did not truly attain, and among them are those who remained in their homes yet received the decree of attainment from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One, through His word that revealeth all things and establisheth every matter. Verily He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Powerful, the Sovereign.\n\nIn the name of the Peerless Friend! The letter which that honored one sent to this servant who is present before the Throne was noted, and the effect of the heart's burning heat in separation from the Dawning-Place of Oneness was perceived. All matters depend upon God's command, and whatsoever hath been revealed by the Pen of the Divine Command concerning any soul is firmly established in all the infinite divine worlds. For example, observe that from the beginning of the mention in the new Revelation, whatsoever was revealed concerning each soul remaineth mentioned until now and shall remain mentioned hereafter, and likewise it is mentioned and established in the infinite worlds. Verily He is knowing of all things and powerful over all things. Therefore that honored one should not be grieved, for the decree of nearness and meeting and presence before the Throne hath repeatedly been revealed specifically for that honored one from the Supreme Pen. Rejoice thou and be of those who are thankful. In this year infinite tribulations have descended and the prison-land hath been witnessed in utmost upheaval and agitation. That which was foretold in previous Tablets hath manifestly come to pass from concealment. In view of these occurrences We did not summon thee before, and until now it hath remained postponed. Should God will and desire thy presence among creation, He will surely summon thee. He is the Protector of those who love Him. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. In any case that honored one should not be grieved, for all good hath been revealed in the Tablets concerning that honored one. Observe how God hath seized those in the lands who transgressed against Our new Name when We sent it with a clear Tablet. We have clothed them with the garment of hunger and fear, for through them was established the foundation of tyranny. Then We shall seize him who was their source. Verily thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty.

He is the Consoler, the Comforter, the Generous One! The Supreme Pen hath revealed concerning the most great tribulation that which caused the Tablet to lament and raised the cry of the Names. O My loved ones, My chosen ones, My leaves and My handmaidens! Be not grieved. By the life of God, after these sorrows, surging oceans of joy shall be witnessed. In the nights and days did the Nature of God lament and the Eye of Loving-kindness wept, although for those of insight and those near to God, whatsoever hath occurred hath been the cause of the exaltation of the Word of God and the advancement of souls. Yet outwardly, from all things - from mountains, trees and seas, even unto the pit and the pebble - lamentation and moaning were raised. Now We counsel all, both men and women, to patience and forbearance. We have loved patience and commanded it unto all, before and after, and at this evident time. O My handmaiden and My leaf! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison. Verily, all the treasures of the earth and the adornment of its queens cannot equal it. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, that there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Powerful. Know thou with clear certainty that God, exalted be His glory, is just, and assuredly according to the requirements of justice shall He requite those who led astray, the polytheists, the slanderers and the murderers. Not an atom escapeth His knowledge. He doeth what He willeth and He is the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Give thanks unto thy Lord, for He hath turned unto thee and revealed for thee from the heaven of utterance that which He hath made a proof unto all who are on earth. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken, as a favor from Him unto His leaves who have drunk the cup of tribulation in the path of God, the Lord of all beings and the Possessor of Names. Convey My greetings to the handmaidens of that land. Say to those who are with thee: Grieve not for what hath befallen My loved ones in My path. Soon shall the tender mercies of their Lord, the Generous One, encompass them. Death is inevitable for all; therefore if it occur in the path of the Peerless Friend, it is assuredly most exalted and most beloved, for that death is the cause of eternal life and the source of everlasting existence. We beseech God to change the sorrow of His loved ones into the Most Great Joy and to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His chosen ones who have sacrificed what they possessed of wealth, souls and bodies in His straight Path. Praise be unto Him, for He is the Goal of the mystics and the Beloved of the worlds.

The Name of Munificence, who circled round the House by night and day, desired thy mention. We have therefore mentioned thee in this mighty Tablet. The Wronged One beareth witness to thy devotion, thy humility, thy submissiveness, thy steadfastness, and thy service to the Cause of God, the sovereign Truth, the manifest Justice. Thou hast performed for God's sake that which shall not perish through the duration of His kingdom and His dominion. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them unto thee, that thy breast may be dilated thereby and thy heart rejoiced. Even so have the glances of the Wronged One been directed towards thee from this far-distant spot. Convey My greetings to the faces of My Afnan, remind them of My verses, and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down for them in the Crimson Book from My Most Exalted Pen. Verily thy Lord is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. We beseech God to protect them from the croaking of every croaker and from those whose hearts and tongues are not in accord. This is what We informed you of before, and at this moment nothing whatsoever escapeth His knowledge. He is the Concealer, the All-Forbearing, the Mighty, the Great. The glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those who are with thee, who love thee and hearken unto thy word concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment.\n\nOne day the Name of Munificence - upon him be My glory - attained the presence of the Face and expressed boundless love and embarrassment regarding the Afnan - upon him be My glory and loving-kindness. He mentioned that he had been the cause of his trouble. In showing kindness and love there was no hesitation. He asked from God - exalted be His glory - for that which endureth and remaineth. We said: O Name of Munificence! The Afnan have come into being from nothingness for the service of God - exalted be His glory. He and all that is with him shall return unto God. This word hath been inscribed by the divine Pen at the very heart of God's Book. Well is it with him and pleasant it is unto him. Convey the greetings of the Wronged One to the loved ones of that land. We beseech God to unite the hearts and tongues of His servants, that the evident bounties and revealed verses may not be deprived of their influence and fruit.

I swear by God that beneath the shade of but one leaf of its Tree have been and shall be created infinite paradises, though not all souls shall receive their portion thereof save whom thy Lord willeth. For at its gate stand the denizens of the all-highest Paradise and its chosen ones, who will not permit entry into this blessed and sublime station until they find one purified and sanctified from all human allusions, earthly indications, personal imaginings and idle fancies. Therefore, O beloved one, regard the vanishing world as non-existent and count all save My remembrance as null. Hold fast unto the cord of My love, that through divine bounty and glorious favor thou mayest enter this spiritual paradise and behold such realms that all thou hast heretofore witnessed shall appear as but a drop compared to the Most Great Ocean, and thou shalt be wholly freed and delivered from earthly dross, entering the holy retreats of divine oneness.\n\nO beloved! When the Day-Star of the horizons shone forth from the Iraq quarter, as that holy and wondrous Temple was seated before the Throne, He desired to utter a wondrous and glorious word and draw thee, through the gems of outpoured and hallowed grace and universal, divine mercy, from the realms of fancy and passion to the pleasant expanses of certitude and eternity. However, in view of the weakness of all created things and whatsoever is therein, and the poverty of the people of creation and all that pertaineth unto them, that Beauty of the All-Sufficient withdrew from the heaven of utterance to the kingdom of silence, lest the pillars of men be shaken and the hearts of people be cut off. For in those days the appointed time of silence in the kingdom of the divine Cause had not yet been fulfilled. Therefore, as a token of grace and bounty toward men, the tongue of clear utterance remained still in the hidden corners of silence. But as in these days the grace of the All-Knowing One hath appeared from the most holy, most gracious, most glorious and most exalted horizon, and the time of silence hath been fulfilled, He hath therefore spoken forth with these most decisive, most perfect and most exact words, that perchance the eyes of the mystics may become purified and sanctified from the veils of sinners and the shrouds of the heedless, that ye may perceive the Beauty of the Lord of Glory Who hath appeared from the horizon of grace and bounty in another turn, and that ye may attain unto His presence, which hath been the true purpose of the Lord of existence.

The whole world hath been created for the knowledge of God, and His knowledge is dependent upon the knowledge of the Manifestation of His Self and the Dawning-Place of His Revelation, inasmuch as that sanctified Being hath ever been, and will forever remain, sanctified from appearance and emergence, and exalted above ascent and descent. All the most beautiful names and most exalted attributes refer back to the Dawning-Place of God's Cause, for He is the Manifestation of God amidst creation. Whoso hath known Him hath known God, and whoso hath turned away from Him hath turned away from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nWhenever the Sun of Truth hath risen from the horizon of divine Will, all people have arisen in opposition and protest, save those souls who have rent asunder the veils of idle fancies with the fingers of certitude and have turned toward the manifest horizon. Today all must fix their gaze upon the horizon of the Cause, for if they turn to aught else besides Him and what proceedeth from His presence, they shall be veiled from the Truth and deprived of the fragrances of the days of God.\n\nConsider the appearance of the Luminary of Truth from the horizon of Hijaz. In the early years, all the divines, men of letters and nobles united in complete opposition to shed His pure blood, yet after His Cause was exalted, a great multitude turned toward the divine horizon of revelation and the dawning-place of celestial light. However, some did so with complete submission and harmony, while others with the utmost duplicity and hypocrisy, as is recorded in detail in the books.\n\nThe purpose of this utterance is that certain souls who attribute themselves to the Truth, while soaring with the wings of self and desire, are not and have never been of the Truth. That honored one should remind all the loved ones of the divine virtues and heavenly commandments, that all may act according to what God hath willed and be adorned with the ornament of love, unity, friendship and concord.\n\nSay: O people! Dispute not concerning the Cause of God. Follow that which ye have been commanded in the perspicuous Book. Beware lest the deeds of those who claim to believe should deter you. He who transgresseth My bounds is not of Me, except he repent and return unto God, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nVerily, I rejoice in what thou hast mentioned before the Throne, and this wondrous Tablet hath been revealed for thee. Those who are heedless this day are indeed wandering in the wilderness of error. Say: Take ye the cup of steadfastness and assurance in the name of your Lord, the All-Merciful, then drink therefrom in spite of those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of all worlds.

Did the oppressors place her grave in a dark well, or did they drag her out with ropes of hatred to another calamity? By the life of the Beloved, the powers of heaven were shaken by this dire catastrophe! Alas! Alas! The Luminary of Batha wailed among the Concourse on High for what befell His family from the manifestations of hatred.\n\nO people of Sad! By God, ye have committed that which hath caused the dawning-places of vainglory and the daysprings of tyranny in all creation to be bewildered. Be fair - by what proof did ye slay those through whom the Cause of the All-Merciful was spread in the East and West of the earth? Alas! Alas! Through you the Ark of the Messenger was broken and the progeny of the Chosen One were drowned. Through you joy was transformed into sorrow and darkness encompassed all in creation, save whom the All-Merciful willed.\n\nO people of Sad! Hearken unto what Muhammad, the Messenger of God, calls out to you from the highest horizon: \"O people of hatred and wickedness! Where is my Hasan who was aflame with the fire of God's love in the kingdom of creation and was adorned with the ornament of faithfulness between earth and heaven? And where is my Husayn who accepted no ransom in the path of God, the Lord of all beings? By My life, O company of evil ones, no excuse or justification remains for you despite My words 'The righteous are Mine and the wicked are Mine.' Did ye imagine faith for yourselves and consider yourselves people of the Furqan? Nay, by the Self of the All-Merciful! Every learned one who donned the robe of grace hath wailed at your deeds, and every knower adorned with justice hath cried out at your actions. The lamentations of the Concourse on High have risen from your tyranny and the cry of all things from what your hands have wrought. Ye read the Qur'an yet deny its Source and He Who revealed it, and ye acknowledge My Messengership yet slay My children and turn away from Him Who sent Me. O company of hatred, ye have bewildered Me - nay, all that was created by the Word of God, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nO Mariner of the Sea! Where are thy ships? Have they been broken by the rocks of unbelief and discord? Or have they been drowned by the winds of oppression and hypocrisy? Or have they sailed from the cities of bodies to the gardens of spirits? Or have they migrated from the wilderness of separation and remoteness to the station of nearness and holiness and reunion? O Lord of the worlds! By Thy might and sovereignty, I cannot mention what befell them from the winds of oppression. By Thy Self, I am ashamed to disclose what I have seen and known. Thou knowest what I have and I know not what Thou hast, for Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. But I present a word to show my submission to Thy binding command and my adherence to Thy decisive decree: The croaking hath risen for the Nightingale hath taken flight.

That which they wrote concerning the harmony and unity of the two stars, upon them both be my Baha and my loving-kindness and my mercy - the horizon of grief hath been illumined and made radiant with the light of joy. We beseech God to make all their deeds and devotions as a single rose, and their condition in my service everlasting. This blessed word is from the Sovereign of existence, that is, the Seal of the Prophets, which He taught to 'Ali. Praise be to God, they have spent themselves in the path of God. From the earliest days they have attained and have drunk the cup of recognition from the hands of the bounty of the Lord of Religions. Happy are they and blessed are they! And concerning what some have written that they speak according to their own vain imaginings and hold fast to that which God hath not intended - there are souls whose tree of hope hath been cut down by their deeds. We have previously revealed in the Hidden Words: \"O MOVING FORM OF DUST! I am fain to commune with thee but thou wouldst put no trust in Me. The sword of thy rebellion hath felled the tree of thy hope. At all times I am near unto thee, but thou art ever far from Me. Imperishable glory I have chosen for thee, yet boundless shame thou hast chosen for thyself. While there is yet time, return, and lose not thy chance.\" O Name of Bounty! God is aware that they have committed deeds at which equity itself hath wept and the heart hath cried out in lamentation. Such souls have ever spoken according to their vain imaginings. In the time of the Seal of the Prophets, every day a few would speak according to their desires. Such souls have ever existed and continue to exist. We beseech God to guide all and deprive none from the ocean of knowledge. Today everything findeth its seeker except the precious pearls that have appeared and shone forth from the treasury of the Supreme Pen - these remain without buyer. The seeker is missing, the purchaser non-existent. Yet a time shall come when people will eagerly purchase the pearls of the ocean of utterance with their very lives. We convey Our greetings to all the friends in that land. O people of God! Steadfastness is beloved. All must be so firm and steadfast that neither the tempests of days nor the hurricanes of vain imaginings shall move them. Those souls who speak contrary to the will of God - their every word and deed testifieth to the loss of such souls. O My loved ones! Be not grieved by anything nor by that which the ignorant utter. These move according to their desires. We beseech God to aid them to return.

O My Afnan, upon thee be My Baha and My loving-kindness! Thy letter which thou didst send to the Afnan, upon him be My Baha and My loving-kindness, was seen. Every letter thereof was illumined with the light of unity and voiced the words \"there is none other God but Him.\" Reflect upon God's loving-kindness - the letter hath attained to this most exalted station and supreme height, while those who considered themselves the most learned and knowledgeable among nations have deviated from the Path and returned to their own abode. I testify that the grace hath encompassed you, and the mercy is with you, and the bounty is yours. Regarding the matter mentioned to his honor Afnan Muhsin, upon him be My Baha, that which is now intended was mentioned. From the first day that honored one hath arisen with complete dedication to serve the Lord of all beings. This is a testimony uttered by the Tongue of Grandeur in His Most Great Prison. In truth, that honored one is numbered among the inheritors of this Cause. Let him act in whatever way he deemeth advisable. The purpose is that there should appear in that land that which will cause the exaltation of the Word of God. The Command is in His hand - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. The glory and the remembrance and the greatness be upon you and upon those who are with you and who love you for the sake of God, the Lord of the worlds. O helper of God's Cause! If wisdom permiteth, inform some of that which befitteth not the days of God and is unacceptable before His Presence. Some of the servants make their own interpretations to justify certain things as lawful, without any evidence from God. Until now no word hath been revealed from the Most Exalted Pen exposing the deeds of such souls, for the Name \"the Concealer\" hath ever clung to the hem of grace. Therefore concealment hath taken precedence. Verily He is the Concealer Who seeth and concealeth, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Although in these days the ocean of forgiveness is surging and the sun of grace is shining from the highest horizon of the world, yet for every deed there is ordained its own effect. Today those servants who gaze toward the Greatest Scene must hold fast to such deeds from which the fragrance of sanctity is wafted and which cause the people of the world to turn towards God. Most strange, utterly strange, are those souls who for the sake of a moment's pleasure deprive themselves of God's good-pleasure which is the cause of eternal life and everlasting bounty. We beseech God to assist them to return and to adorn them with the ornament of fear of God. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the Lord of the throne on high and of earth below.\n\n=== END BH02354 ===\n\n=== START BH02355 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Grandeur and the Power!

How excellent is the Giver and how excellent is the achiever! O Mustafa Afnan, upon him and upon thee be My glory! He hath sought from the Sun of Truth a special effulgence for you, that perchance the horizons of the world may be adorned with the light of unity from the lights of the Sun of inner meanings, such that thou shalt see therein, that is on earth, neither crookedness nor inequality. O Mahdi Afnan, upon him be the peace of the All-Merciful! He hath desired to bring a fruit from the Lote-Tree of utterance that thou mayest find intimate fellowship with the remembrance of God in joy and gladness and delight and bliss, and hold fast unto that which beseemeth the station of man. O Muhammad-'Ali, O Afnan! From the garden of knowledge he cometh with roses of remembrance and utterance. His remembrance is the dawning-place of remembrances and his utterance is the luminary of proof. Blessed art thou and blessed are they that attain! O 'Ali, O Afnan! From the fresh palm tree of knowledge he hath desired fresh dates to place in the mouths of those who seek the Ka'bah of knowledge, and the herald of glory proclaimeth \"Well done!\" O My loved ones ('Illiyin)! When the vengeance and might of autumn seized the world, Afnan cometh with the breezes of the divine springtime and the rains of vernal mercy. We hope that the earth of existence may become verdant and flourishing through the grace of these days. O Muhammad-Qabl-i-Husayn! Say: O Pure One! O King! Every one possessed of knowledge hath testified to Thy oneness. Thou art that Almighty One whose bounty brought existence into being, and the errors of the servants held not back Thy favors. O Generous One! Illumine through the Dawning-Place of Thy light and grant true wealth from the Day-Spring of Thy riches. Thou art the Bestower and the Powerful. O Husayn! Say: O Lord! Thou art that King whom the hosts of the world did not prevent from Thy Cause, and the might of the nations held not back from Thy power. Thou art that Generous One whom the disobedience of the people of possibility did not prevent from the kingdom of forgiveness. Thy mercy, like a copious rain, descendeth upon the righteous and the sinful. O Merciful One! Withhold not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy bounty and deprive them not. Thou art the Bestower and the Kind. O Light! O Expansive One! Afnan, upon him be the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful, hath desired to take from the heaven of grace a brilliant star and bring it as a gift. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, the Lord of the mighty throne. And we seal the book with mention of al-Javad, upon him be My glory, who hath turned towards you. We beseech God, exalted be He, to aid him and His loved ones in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for them good in the hereafter and the former life, and We ask Him to strengthen them in that whereby their remembrances and their names and their stations and their conditions may endure.

The enemies have invented calumnies and made these the means of their own associating partners with God, seeking thereby to ensnare heedless and ignorant souls. The Most Exalted Pen declareth: Such mentions serve only the purposes of malicious souls. But those servants who have quaffed the sealed wine and dwell beneath the banner of \"God doeth whatsoever He willeth\" see all else as non-existent and void. They have raised high the pavilion of certitude; the winds of idle fancies neither prevent nor move them. By God's life! All things have wept tears of blood at the tyranny of the oppressors, yet these shameless people - the followers of the Bayan - display no modesty but cling to the cord of falsehood and grasp the hem of calumny, that perchance they might deprive helpless servants of the rain of divine mercy, even as they did aforetime. Say: O people of God! Be not weak-spirited, be not moved by every wind, be not deluded by every word. The Tree of Revelation, which in former Books was referred to as the One Who conversed on Sinai, hath from the beginning appeared and stood manifest before the faces of the divines and rulers. Most of the world's peoples have, without veil or hindrance, seen and heard. Where were those manifestations of doubt and sources of idle fancy in those days? By God's life! Each one, from fear in those days, was concealed behind a veil and hidden behind a curtain. Say: By God! Should anyone deny this Most Great Cause and this Great Announcement, he cannot prove any other matter. To this testifieth the Mother Book which is with Him. Well is it with thee, O My Afnan, for having attained the presence and heard and seen that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Sacred Scrolls and Tablets. Thy letter hath been presented repeatedly, and from each letter We have inhaled the fragrance of thy love and sincerity toward God, the Illuminator of the horizons. Soon shall the world and all that thou beholdest today perish, and there shall endure that which hath been ordained for you by the Pen of Destiny from One Who is the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. We beseech God - exalted be He - to aid thee and grant thee success in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. Hold fast unto wisdom lest the clamor be raised of those who have denied the Beginning and the End. That which thou didst send hath been presented before the Wronged One and hath been adorned with the ornament of acceptance. Be thankful and say: Praise be unto Thee, O Thou Who hast remembered me while I was in prison through that which the hands of every associating doubter had wrought.

Thou hast made mention of the friends and desired for each that which abideth and endureth in the Book of God. These souls have been and are remembered, and for each hath been ordained that which the minds and souls of the peoples of the world are powerless to comprehend and reckon. At some time, act on behalf of His Holiness 'Ayn \\[the Bab\\], upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, and perform that which hath been the hope of the Messengers. The people of Baha, that is, those souls who have arisen to assist and are engaged in service, have each been blessed with the traces of the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to aid all to do that which He loveth and is pleased with. Convey on behalf of this Wronged One greetings to each one and gladden them with the bounties of God, exalted be His glory. The ocean of divine verses surgeth, and the lights of the Day-Star of grace shine forth and are manifest from the horizon of His will. Soon shall be made known the stations of those who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken from His Most Glorious Station. At all times verses descend like rain from the heaven of the favor of the Lord of the Worlds - nay, even more abundantly - yet the people remain in evident doubt and mighty suspicion. His honor Nabil, son of Nabil, hath from the first days until now been blessed with favor and engaged in service. However, in the great city there befell him that which caused grief to those near unto God. With the permission of this Wronged One he arrived in that land and attained unto His good-pleasure. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to transform his sorrows into supreme joy, and We ask Him, exalted be He, to draw him nigh and ordain for him to attain the presence of the Wronged One. Verily He is the Almighty, the Powerful. O Nabil! His honor 'Ali-Akbar, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, hath repeatedly made mention of thee. He kept faith with the Covenant and made mention of the loved ones of the All-Merciful in a missive which he sent to the Wronged One. We have answered him at this time with this Perspicuous Tablet. We beseech God to ever aid His loved ones to that which will lead to the reformation of the world and the tranquility of the nations. By My life! There shall appear from them that which God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, hath willed. Whatsoever hath been revealed in the Book of God for each of the loved ones shall assuredly come to pass.

Verily He will make clear unto thee His path, manifest unto thee His Cause, and draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. The cawing hath been raised - this is among the divine promises that flowed from the Supreme Pen in Zawra'. Protect the souls from the guile of the cawers in the name of God, exalted be His glory. For twelve hundred years the ignorant divines educated people in vain imaginings, with the result that on the Last Day they issued the death warrant of the Lord of the world. Reflect upon the fruits of the deeds of that vile party, namely the Shi'ites, and hold fast to the firm and mighty cord. Perchance through His wondrous grace He may protect these helpless people from the deception of the turbaned ones. Consider the Most Holy Book - mention of what would appear in the land of Kaf and Ra was revealed in that sacred tablet from the Pen. Convey My greetings to the friends in that land. Say: This is the day of steadfastness and the day of service. Thieves lie in wait and robbers stand ready, that they might find an opportunity to steal away the pearls of divine love. Beseech God that He may aid you to remain firm with supreme steadfastness and to perform such deeds as will endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven.\n\nO Rafi'! Reflect upon the pole of the divines, namely Shaykh Muhammad Hasan Najafi, who at the beginning of the Revelation was the chief divine of Persia. That aforementioned pole, together with all the Persian divines, engaged in cursing and denouncing the Lord of mankind and Master of the world. Finally they issued the death warrant for His pure blood. There occurred that which caused the Spirit of Truth to lament and the dwellers of the highest paradise to weep - a weeping that caused all things to don the garment of grief. Fie upon them and upon what their hands have wrought! Make the friends aware of past vain imaginings, that they may not again be debarred from the straight path by green and white turbans and remain deprived of the Most Great Ocean. Be a helper of thy Lord's Cause in such wise that nothing whatsoever shall deter thee, no host shall frighten thee, no might of the mighty nor authority of the divines shall weaken thee. By My life! The world shall pass away and thou shalt find thyself in a glorious station, were the merest trace thereof, even less than a needle's eye, to be revealed, all on earth would swoon away, save whom God, thy Lord, the Mighty, the Great, willeth.

In these days the Supreme Pen has preferred and chosen silence over speech. In the nights and days its scratching is raised, yet ears capable of hearing are rarer than the red elixir. The revelation has encompassed all possibility and divine verses have descended like torrential rain, yet ignorant servants cling to vain imaginings and hold fast to calumnies. Previously, one lying malicious woman caused disorder among the Shi'ih party and on the Day of Judgment sent them all to hell, such that from pulpits and shrines they cursed the Truth and issued fatwas for the shedding of His most pure blood. Now too the deniers of the Bayan cling to the same vain imaginings and are occupied with misleading people. The words of the past have resurfaced - sometimes they say the Bayan has been altered, uttering calumnies the like of which have never been heard in creation. It is not known what they have understood from the Day of God and by what proof and evidence they have chosen faith. O Muhammad! By the life of God, they are seen to be more degraded and more rebellious than the previous party. Say: Woe unto you! Were it not for the Glory (Baha), who would call out before all humanity? And were it not for Him, who would manifest the Truth before the faces of the rulers? Fear God, O people, then be fair in His Cause, the firm, the mighty, the wondrous. And among them is one who said that He stole the verses of the Point and revealed them in His own name. Say: Woe unto you, O heedless doubter! Say: Die in your rage! God has made His Bayan the point of circumambulation for the books of the world. Fear the All-Merciful, O people, and be not of the wrongdoers. Say: Do you believe in the Point yet deny His Messenger, and do you read the verses yet reject their Revealer? Be fair and be not of the losers. O Muhammad! Aid thy Lord through wisdom and utterance, and be not of the silent ones. We have mentioned thee before and at this time, that thou mayest arise to aid the Cause with a steadfastness that the doubts of the people cannot shake nor the gestures of any remote scholar prevent. We ask God to forgive thee and forgive those for whom thou didst previously seek forgiveness. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\nConvey the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends. Say: O people of God! Hold fast to the truth alone. By the life of God, this Day is different from other days and this Cause is different from other causes. It has no likeness in what came before or after. Abandon what the people possess and take what ye are commanded by God, the Ordainer, the Ancient. O people of God! Strive that perchance the croaking of the croakers and the clamor of the transgressors may not deprive the people from the Lord of the Day of Judgment.

O My loved ones! Baha does not know which of His tribulations to recount to you. Shall He mention what was inflicted upon Him by the oppressors, or what was visited upon you by Satan's party who disbelieved in their Lord, the All-Merciful? We were sitting in prison while two watchmen, through whom the clouds were prevented and fires were kindled, stood guard. Whenever anyone entered the city gate turning toward God, they would inform their chief. Thus were the loved ones prevented from drawing nigh unto their Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Thus does the Ancient Beauty inform you after grief has seized Him. And remember when Nabil-i-Akbar sought to attain the presence of the Throne - the heedless ones seized him and expelled him from the city. At this the Dove lamented, all things wept, and the faces of those who had turned to God, the Mighty, the Gracious, grew pale. Every day these two visited upon Us what had never been visited upon anyone before - with thy Lord is the knowledge of what was and what will be. When We would send Tablets, they would whisper in hearts to seize God's Tablet and its effect. Thus was the water of life withheld and the gates of reunion were closed to those who had turned to their Lord's face, the Mighty, the Help in Peril. At all times they consulted on shedding My blood, after they had imprisoned Us for what their hands and the hands of those who denied the proof and disbelieved in the evidence had wrought. When they entered the seat of government they would say \"We have disbelieved in God,\" but when they saw others like themselves they would say \"We are among those who follow what was revealed in the Bayan.\" Every atom testifies to their falsehood and the Concourse on High curse them. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We remember God at all times and convey His messages in such wise that the followers of all religions cannot prevent Us. Those who turned away after God came upon white clouds with power and sovereignty are among those upon whose foreheads the Most Exalted Pen has inscribed \"This one is among the losers.\" O thou who art mentioned before the Throne! Remember thy Lord among His loved ones that they may know what was visited upon Him by the oppressors. Take care not to grieve at anything - put your trust in God your Lord. He aids whomsoever He wishes with hosts of angels - verily He is the Help in Peril. It behooveth everyone who has turned to God to manifest that whereby God's remembrance may be exalted among His servants. These are indeed the people of Paradise - thy Lord, the Mighty, the Most High, beareth witness to this. The people are as dead, except those who have attained the Kawthar of life flowing from the direction of the Throne of the All-Merciful at all times. Blessed is he who hath cast away all else save Me, adorned his heart with the ornament of My remembrance and his face with the lights of My love - he dwelleth within the tabernacles of My mercy, around which circle the denizens of Paradise.

The clouds are the trace of My movement and the winds are sent forth by My Word, and the signs appear by My wondrous command. By God! The sun is the trace of My Face, shining and luminous, and the stupor which thou seest in the people is from the trace of My awe which hath encompassed creation. Thus hath the Truth spoken - hearken and be of the thankful ones. Creation is the trace of My Will, and for My love for them have I unveiled My Beauty and manifested My sovereignty which hath conquered the worlds. Dost thou see any besides Me, that thou shouldst recognize My nearness unto him? Say: Glory be to God! All is nothingness before the Ancient One. The kingdom belongeth to none save God, the One, the Single, the Peerless, the Mighty. He hath neither nearness nor remoteness, and such mentions are made in the cities of names. Verily thy Lord is sanctified above what the servants know. He is indeed exalted above all creation. All that hath been created is My trace, not My Self. Know thou this and be of the thankful ones. Beware lest thou mention creation at the manifestation of Truth. Avoid those who take partners with Him and know not that they are among the heedless ones. Are darkness and light equal? Say: Glory be to the Manifestation, that the birds of the hearts of the mystics should ascend unto Him! Whatsoever appeareth in the kingdom of that which We have explained to thee is created from the trace of thy Lord's Pen, and that which descendeth from it is the sovereign of traces and is better than that upon which the sun shineth. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who seeketh it from God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. As to what thou hast asked thy Lord, the Great, the Most High, know thou that although We desire not to turn away any who ask, yet wouldst thou be content in thyself that this trace, upon which dependeth the life of the world, should be governed by what any of the servants hath spoken? Say: Glory be to Thee, O my God! Cause me to know what Thou desirest, for I am among the worshippers. I have forsaken what is with me in hope of what is with Thee, for Thou art the Most Merciful of the merciful ones. And since We behold thee asking thy Lord, We shall not disappoint thee from this mighty gate. Know thou that since it is established that He encompasseth all things and knoweth them, it is established that He is nearer to things than they are to themselves. Dost thou not see how We erase and confirm and inspire in hearts? And verily He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. There is no God but Him, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. This is the sovereign utterance in this station. If thou knowest, thou wouldst say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Verily this evanescent one mentioned him before the Face when your letter arrived containing his mention and writing. He - may my spirit be his sacrifice - said that he should recite this prayer:\n\nHe is the Powerful over all things through His word \"Be\" and it is!\n\nGlory be to Thee, O Lord of all beings and Educator of all created things!

God has indeed heard what issued from your lips in praise of the Manifestation of His Self. Nothing escapes His knowledge and He has knowledge of all things. Know that the tongue was created to praise God, your Lord and the Lord of the worlds, and that the heart was fashioned to love your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Most High, the Most Great, and that the ear was formed to hearken unto His most wondrous and incomparable melodies. How blessed art thou for having heard His words and for having spoken in His remembrance and praise, and for having attained unto His love and good-pleasure. This is indeed a supreme triumph. Be steadfast in thy love for thy Creator in such wise that shouldst thou find no one else who shares His love and His Cause, thou wouldst not be perturbed within thyself but wouldst remain steadfast and filled with manifest joy, for this is a cup from which none can drink save the near servants of God. Hast thou ever seen the dung beetle yearn for the fragrance of musk, or the swine drink from the Kawthar of life? Nay, by the Lord of the worlds! Each one acts according to his nature and associates with his own kind. Thus has the decree been sent down in the Tablets by the command of God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forebears of old. And if thou wert to look with the eye of thy Lord, thou wouldst surely behold those who have denied God in these days in the form of dogs and swine.

Then detach thyself from every sinful polytheist.

This Wronged One, despite countless afflictions, summoned the people of the earth to the most exalted horizon during the days and nights, that perchance hearts might be cleansed and sanctified from the doubts and signs of imitation and restriction and from vain imaginings and idle fancies, that they might find themselves free and unfettered. However, the heedless servants did not hearken to the Word of Truth and arose in rejection and opposition, as ye have all seen and heard. In days when the opposition of the divines, the objections of the mystics, and the power of princes had encompassed all, this Wronged One arose alone to promote the Cause - an arising that the hosts of earth were powerless to prevent. And when the effulgences of the Sun of Truth became somewhat manifest, certain ones emerged from behind the veil and arose to waste the Cause of God, to such an extent that pen and tongue are powerless to describe. They have desired to make the weak ones among the servants more veiled than the parties of the past. Beseech ye God to assist His loved ones in protecting souls.

If we say we were and are satisfied with it, it is observed to have become a barrier and cause of prevention, and the reason for separation and remoteness which has ever been detested. And if we mention anything less than good, this would be counted among real transgressions, for it has been and remains among the greatest bounties with God, the Lord of Names. Wisdom lies in being grateful in all conditions, in delegating to Him and relying upon Him. Surely the Just, the Trustworthy has not and will not let slip the interests of His friends.

From the earliest days until now they have dedicated themselves to mention and praise and service to the Cause. Indeed they have performed that which has had and continues to have few equals or parallels. To this testifies this Wronged One, this Stranger. Praise be to God Who aided him and caused him to soar on the wings of detachment in the atmosphere of His love, the Mighty, the Wondrous, and adorned him with the ornament of His love amongst His servants. Verily, He is powerful over all things.\n\nPraise be to God! In the nights and days they are engaged in remembrance and in this field they are mentioned, meaning they are occupied with the remembrance of God and are mentioned in the presence of the Remembered One. The pen is powerless to make mention of this station and the maidservant is unable to describe it. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, to shower His grace and bounty upon them at all times. Verily He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower. And that which was sent arrived with this servant through that spiritual beloved, he who is turned towards the Most Exalted Names, his honor M.H., upon him be the glory of God, the Most Glorious. Peace and praise and remembrance and glory be upon you and upon those who love you for the sake of God, our Lord and your Lord and the Lord of the heavens and earths.\n\n=== END BH02373 ===\n\n=== START BH02374 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Powerful\n\nToday all things are speaking this most exalted Word: \"He Who was promised in the Books of God and mentioned in the hearts of the Messengers hath come.\" O My Afnan! Today the Eternal God speaketh. All the near ones, the sincere ones, the chosen ones and the favored ones have given glad tidings of this Most Great Revelation and have made mention of the trials and tribulations that would come to pass, even unto the prison of 'Akka. Blessed is the soul that hath arisen to serve and is engaged in such deeds and character as befit the Day of God. This Wronged One seeketh helpers, and helpers are deeds from which the fragrance of God can be inhaled. Verily doth the Glory of God forbid all from following their desires and command them to fear God, the Lord of all creation. In one of the Tablets this most exalted Word was revealed: All the Prophets and chosen ones were commanded by God, exalted be His glory, to water the trees of human existence with the living waters of refinement and wisdom, that there might appear from all that which God hath deposited within man. Every tree hath its fruit, as is plainly evident. The purpose of all they have spoken and taught was, in one respect, the preservation of human dignity and station. Blessed is the soul that in the Day of God hath held fast unto the divine principles and hath not deviated from the true Law. The fruits of the tree of existence which are attributed to God, glorified be He, have been and are trustworthiness, religiousness, truthfulness and sincerity. And the greatest of all, after recognition of the unity of the Lord, exalted and glorified be He, is regard for the rights of one's parents. This matter hath been mentioned in all the heavenly Books and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen. Consider what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"Worship God and join not any partners with Him, and show kindness unto parents.\" Observe how association with parents is linked with the recognition of the one true God. Blessed is every wise mystic who witnesseth and seeth and readeth and recognizeth and acteth according to that which God hath revealed in the Books and in this mighty Tablet. Praise be to God that thou hast recognized that of which the peoples of the world, of whatever kind, are deprived. That which the Most Exalted Pen now commandeth thee is to make thy father pleased with thee, for the good pleasure of God, exalted be His glory, dependeth on this. We have, through Our special favor, acquainted thee with this matter. Act according to that which thou hast been commanded and be of the thankful ones. He will assuredly reward thee for thy deeds, purely for the sake of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Glory be upon thee and upon My Afnan and upon those who are with thee and have believed in the One, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH02374 ===\n\n=== START BH02375 ===\n\nIn His Name, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful!\n\nToday all must fix their gaze upon this Most Great Word which is like unto a heaven for the ocean of inner meanings. Follow ye My laws for love of My beauty. The souls that have turned to God and are steadfast must act in accordance with whatsoever hath been revealed in God's Book - that is to say, such deeds as cause not the outbreak of sedition and hatred. Some deeds today are and have been contrary to divine wisdom, while others are in harmony therewith. Blessed is the soul that hath done what beseemeth the Day of God.\n\nO thou seeker of the Desired One! Praise be to the Goal of the world Who hath assisted thee and enabled thee to attain His most great bounty. Thou didst journey and arrive until thou didst attain the presence at the Gate which was opened unto all who are in the heavens and on earth. Be thou thankful to God for this supreme favor.\n\nConvey the greetings of the Wronged One to the friends in that land. All must observe wisdom and hold fast unto it, dealing with the people of the city in the utmost joy and fragrance, and cleaving to such means as will conduce to the fellowship of hearts and the attraction of souls. Perfect wisdom requireth kindliness, care, compassion and loving-kindness. This is the day of spiritual virtues, goodly words and righteous deeds. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of utterance, shining and manifest from the heaven of the Most Great Prison, that the hosts of virtuous character and deeds are mightier than the hosts of the world. The Lord of the celestial throne beareth witness to this in the Most Great Prison. Blessed is he who hath been just in the Cause of God, and woe unto every sinful denier.\n\nWith perfect unity and harmony raise ye the remembrance of God, exalted be His glory, and be ye steadfast in His Cause, in such wise that neither the barking of the heedless, nor the signs of the deniers, nor the onslaught of the transgressors shall hold you back from the straight path. The barkers have ever lain in wait. Blessed is the soul that hath shown forth supreme steadfastness and hath uttered that which hath caused the foundations of every heedless doubter to quake. Satan hath ever sought to prevent the steadfast from the straight path through piety and asceticism. The monotheists and the sincere must arise to serve the Cause with perfect certitude and assurance, in such wise that were all the world to appear with complete asceticism and utter a word contrary to what hath flowed from the Supreme Pen, they would be rejected and would be accounted among the people of hell in God's presence.\n\nThe servant present hath attained with thy letter and read it before the Countenance. We have answered thee with this Tablet and have mentioned thee in such wise as naught in all creation can equal it. Give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the All-Bountiful. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My grace be upon thee and upon every one who hath turned unto God and is steadfast, and upon those women who have believed in the One, the All-Informed.\n\n=== END BH02375 ===\n\n=== START BH02376 ===\n\nO Sadra! The Hidden Book in this visible Temple speaks: There is no God but Him, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Verily it is a Book inscribed by a Pen that cannot be described by what exists in creation nor mentioned by the Most High. Blessed is the soul that has found the fragrance of God on a day wherein the Sun of Beauty has dawned from the horizon of God, the Mighty, the Wise - a day wherein was written what no one in all creation has known or will know except those whom We have permitted in truth. Thus have We adorned the Tablet with the ornament of utterance when the All-Merciful was established upon a seat around which circle the denizens of the highest Paradise, then the inhabitants of the cities of names, then those whose faces are turned only to His shining, radiant Beauty. Blessed art thou, O Sadra, in that thou hast taken the foremost position in creation when thou didst turn to God, the Powerful, the Most High, the Great. This indeed is a glory in which honored servants take pride. Be thou steadfast in the Cause of God and His love, then give glad tidings to the servants with wisdom and utterance to this Kawthar whose fragrant breezes have wafted among the worlds. Beware lest the affairs of creation veil thee from what thou hast been commanded by the True One. Trust in Him in all conditions - verily He is with His remembering servants. We counsel thee to wisdom in all matters - this is what God has ordained in the Tablets. He is indeed the Ruler, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O Sadra! We have heard thy call from before and from thy letter afterwards when it was present before the Throne. Verily We were aware and We answered thee in truth and granted what thou didst desire from God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. He assists whom He wishes with authority from His presence and causes whom He wills to speak with His beautiful remembrance. Thou didst say \"Expand my breast\" and so forth - We granted what thou desired before thy request. Were it not for this how couldst thou have turned to a Face from which most of the servants have turned away? Reflect and be of those who remember. We have expanded thy breast and assisted thee to draw near to this Great Sea and We will assist thee in truth and will open thy tongue with a remembrance by which hearts will be attracted and the hearts of those who have turned will take flight. We counsel thee to the Greater Steadfastness in such wise that the hearts of those who have taken the calf as their lord instead of God will be troubled. This is what the Most Exalted Pen commands thee on this wondrous day. And We have sent down for thy brother that by which the fragrances of My loving-kindness and the sweet perfumes of My favors have been diffused - to this testifies he who ponders what has been sent down in truth. Verily thy Lord is the True, the Trustworthy One. Say: O people! Fear God and commit not that which would muddy the pure chalice of mystic knowledge in the days of the All-Merciful. Leave what ye possess, turning to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Thus have We adorned thy head with the crown of remembrance and sent thee this Tablet from whose horizon has shone the sun of thy Lord's remembrance, the Most High, the Great.\n\n=== END BH02376 ===\n\n=== START BH02377 ===\n\nHe is the Most Wondrous! O Hasan! Show excellence even as God has shown excellence unto thee, inasmuch as He hath caused thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self and brought thee to the shore of grace, a praiseworthy seat of glory, and hath bestowed upon thee that which is better in His sight than all who are in the heavens and earth - and He Himself is witness to this. Therefore arise and show excellence unto thyself and then unto the souls of the servants. Fear no one, but place thy trust in God Who created all things by His command, for verily He hath power over all the worlds. Verily, thy excellence unto thyself is thy steadfastness in the Cause of God and thy following this Light which hath appeared from the horizon of grace in manifest truth. Well is it with thee for having recognized God thy Lord in days wherein all were far removed from the holy precinct, and for having found solace in Him Who hath attained the presence of God, heard His melodies, beheld His countenance, and remained turned toward Him at every morn and eve. Beware lest thou separate thyself from Him. Hold fast unto Him in these days and take Him as thy friend. Give thanks unto God thy Lord for having made the fire as light unto thee, whereby He opened before thy face in the prison a gate from the Ridvan and caused the breezes of glorious love to waft upon thee, awakened thee from thy slumber, caused thee to know His Self, and inscribed thy name among the triumphant ones in the preserved tablets of holiness. Thus doth God make imprisonment as paradise for whomsoever He willeth among His servants. There is no God but Him. His is the creation and the command, and verily He encompasseth all things. Cast behind thee all allusions and take hold of the Tablet of God with strength from Him, and follow not those who have taken Satan as their friend. Beware lest thou forget the grace of God or turn to the world and what is ordained therein, for verily His grace unto thee hath been great. Remember thyself throughout all days lest thou become heedless of the remembrance of thy Lord and remain veiled behind the veils. For those who claim belief have disbelieved in God and His signs after they came unto them from the Dayspring of the Cause with manifest sovereignty - save him who held fast to the cord of His grace, purified his heart from the dust of blind imitation and passion, and soared in this heaven with the wings of detachment in manifest truth. Thus have We taught thee and informed thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and remain steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord. Grieve not over the world and what hath befallen thee, for it shall perish by a word, and sovereignty shall remain with God, thy Lord and the Lord of all things and the Lord of all the worlds. And the mercy that floweth from the direction of the Throne be upon thee and upon those who have remained firm in the Cause and have held fast in these days to the cord of grace in truth.\n\n=== END BH02377 ===\n\n=== START BH02378 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty!

Through him appeared the Word of Primalness and the Divine Point and the Hidden Beauty and the Standing Alif and the Descended Ha and the Extended Ba, if ye be of them that understand. Through him appeared existence and rose the Beauty of the Worshipped One, and the pure Oneness was bounded by the ornament of a known name, that people might be enabled to draw nigh unto Him - and this verily is a manifest bounty, for were He to appear as He truly is, none would be able to draw nigh unto Him or behold Him or learn from Him the knowledge of what was and what shall be. Thus know thou the mysteries of wisdom through that which We have imparted unto thee, then ponder upon them that God may thereby open unto thy heart the gates of hidden knowledge. O Ali! Give thanks unto God thy Creator that thou didst attain the presence of the Servant in his final days, and thereby wert among those who were guided by the guidance of His countenance. Blessed be thine eye for what it beheld, and thine ear for what it heard, and thy body for having attained a praiseworthy station of nearness. Happy art thou, O servant, for having emigrated from thy home and journeyed unto God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, until thou didst arrive at the city which was named the Abode of Peace aforetime, for it submitted in this holy and renowned Manifestation. Thus doth God blot out what He willeth and confirm what He willeth, and with Him is the Mother Book preserved. And hadst thou delayed in this, thou wouldst not have attained this triumph which the denizens of Paradise long for, if ye be of them that are certain. It would have passed thee by as it hath passed most people who are now in evident grief and lamentation. Therefore know within thyself that it behooveth no one to delay in pursuing good works when able, and this verily is a truth inscribed in this unfurled scroll. Say: By God! This is verily the frequented House which hath been raised up in truth from God, the Mighty, the Thankworthy. Around it circle the people of the Supreme Concourse and they who have hearkened unto God's call on this Mount, for it is the source of Revelation and the manifestation of joy from God, the Mighty Sovereign, the Merciful, the Generous, the All-Forgiving. Thus have We mentioned thee in this Tablet that thine eye might be solaced and thou mightest be certain that We have not forgotten those who have believed in God and His signs, then in His proof and His evidence, then in His glory and His sovereignty, then in His beauty and His majesty, and who were among those who aimed at the goals of glory.

O Isma'il! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One. He mentioneth thee even as He mentioned thee before, and desireth naught save thy drawing nigh unto God, the Lord of the worlds. He who loved Me and soared in Mine atmosphere, who was named Nazir - upon him be My glory - came and mentioned thee. We have remembered thee in a Tablet adorned with the gems We have brought forth from the treasury of Mine wondrous utterance. By My life! My Tablets are not equaled by the tablets of the world, nor My mention by the mention of all who are in the heavens and the earth. Say: O people of the Bayan! The Divine Lote-Tree hath been adorned with wondrous, fresh fruits and delicate, new produce. Behold, and be not of the heedless ones. By My life! He whom Satan hath led astray used to serve Me night and day, at morn and at eventide. O thou who hast turned towards Mine horizon! Glorify on My behalf the Hands of My Cause, whom We have chosen for My remembrance amongst My servants and for the proclamation of My Most Great Call and My Great News. We beseech God to guard them, preserve them, and aid them with His hosts from on high. O My loved ones! We have caused the rains of My mercy to descend from the clouds of My bounty, and have revealed that which was hidden in God's knowledge, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Blessed is he who hath cast away all else save Me and acted according to what hath been ordained in My perspicuous Book. O Asadullah, O son of Nazir - upon thee be My glory! Thou hast been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to open before thy face, through the key of His Most Bountiful Name, the doors of His grace, wealth and riches, and to ordain for thee that which will draw thee nigh unto Him in all conditions. He is verily the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Bountiful. When thou hearest My call and attainest unto the recognition of My verses, say: \"My God, my God! Praise be unto Thee for having guided me unto Thy station and honored me with Thy presence. I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy bounty to make me detached from all else save Thee and sanctified from whatsoever is repugnant to Thy good-pleasure. O my Lord!

Praise be to the Goal of the world and the Beloved of nations, Who enabled you to recognize this great Day and whatsoever hath been manifested therein. How many souls, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, beseeched and hoped for the presence of this Day from the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Yet after the rising of the Most Great Orb from the horizon of the heaven of truth, all remained veiled save a few who now rejoice in Paradise. O thou who gazest toward the Most Exalted Horizon! Until the people become aware of the falsehoods of the past, they will not bear witness to the truth of this manifest Day. And even should they acknowledge it, it would be merely through imitation. But if one soul becomes informed and attains unto awareness, it is more beloved in the sight of God than a thousand souls, nay more. Say: O people! Reflect upon that which existed among the People of the Furqan - that is, those who considered themselves saved - that perchance after reflection ye may bear witness to this most exalted and most holy Cause. Such witness is regarded by God as a deed for which there hath not been and never shall be any equal. O friend! The people of the Bayan are veiled to such a degree that pen and tongue are powerless to describe it. They cling to the vain imaginings of the People of the Furqan and hold fast to the suppositions of the ignorant. How many traditions and narratives concerning the Qa'im did they recite day and night, unaware that all were devoid of the ornament of truth. The Most Exalted Pen uttereth these words that perchance they may break the chains of idle fancy through the power of certitude, and may cease to look to the tales, traces and stories of old, that they may behold the Truth with the eye of truth, and regard that which appeareth from Him as the standard and proof. Say: He needeth not, in establishing His Cause, the books of the past nor what appeared in former ages. Thus hath spoken the Tongue of Grandeur in His mighty prison. The satans of the Bayan strive to make these helpless souls more veiled than the peoples of the past. The upright souls must, with perfect wisdom and utterance, and for the sake of God alone, make the people aware, that they may become informed and sanctified, and then turn to the Most Exalted Horizon. This is the counsel of the Wronged One, the Peerless, in the prison of 'Akka. Blessed art thou, and blessed is every face that hath turned, every heart that hath advanced, and every tongue that hath spoken in praise of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH02380 ===\n\n=== START BH02381 ===\n\nO Siyyid Qabla-Rida, upon him be the Most Great and Most Ancient Glory of God!

The inner reality of the inner reality of the inner reality unto infinity has appeared in the form of a chalice, that it might be the vessel for this pure water which flows from the right hand of the Throne of the Lord of Manifestation. Then hearken to another strain: Verily the inner reality of the inner reality of the inner reality unto whatsoever God willeth hath appeared in the form of a chalice, that it might bear the sweet waters of thy Lord's mercy which flow from the direction of the Throne of My Name, the Most High, the Great. God willing, drink ye of these waters and bestow them upon the people. Shouldst thou attain unto the station We have mentioned, thou wouldst find thyself in such rapture as would render the tongues of all beings powerless to describe it, and thou wouldst reach a station wherein thou wouldst soar in the atmosphere of thy Lord's love, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. That which He ordaineth for His servants outwardly is a reality around which revolve inner meanings, and thy Lord is sanctified above all that hath been said or shall be said. He is the Mighty, the Generous.\n\nIt is desired that you arise with the utmost devotion to serve the Cause and reflect upon the condition of this wronged Prisoner Who hath been afflicted between two factions, and seek to follow His example. The contingent world and all therein is transient. We must all arise to serve the Eternal, that perchance our lives be not wasted and we may render some service. The foundation of all things is the unity of the people upon one Law. Observe ye the Muslim community and its weakness, and ponder its cause. This weakness hath come about solely due to the differences that have appeared therein, as thou canst see how each faction hath chosen its own path and walketh in its own way. And if someone should say \"The paths to God are as numerous as the souls of creation\" and that these paths have branched from the Most Great Path - even granting this claim, surely if one walketh upon the Most Great and Supreme Path it would be best and ever shall be, and nearest to righteousness. There are countless utterances regarding these matters, but in view of the sorrows that have descended, We have confined Ourselves to this much. In truth, Our main purpose was to make mention of you, lest you think you have been forgotten from the Most Great Scene. You have ever been remembered and, God willing, shall continue to be. We beseech God to manifest through you that which will revive the hearts of men, attract souls, cause spirits to soar, and raise up every moldering bone. Verily, glory be upon you and upon those who have turned to the Qiblih of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\n=== END BH02381 ===\n\n=== START BH02382 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One Loving God!\n\nO Sun! Hearken with thy soul to the song of the Nightingale of the Beloved, that perchance thou mayest with all thy spirit take thy step beyond the realm of self and passion, and pass into the placeless realm of glorious permanence, become detached from life and intimate with the Life of life. If thou traversest the vast expanse of the realm of the spirit, surely thou wilt rend asunder the garment of patience and forbearance, become swift in sacrificing thy life, pass beyond the defilement of nothingness and find repose upon the throne of ancient days. Of necessity from everything a sign appeareth, and from every hint a mystery is revealed. Until the world-illumining sun shineth forth, the east cannot be distinguished from the west, nor the rose garden from the furnace. After all, the divine melody is clearly distinct from the earthly cry, and the cawing of the crow is patently different from the song of the nightingale of the garden, for this latter telleth of the paradise of the Beloved and addeth to the spirit, while the former pointeth to the city of the blind and diminisheth faith. One must take a step and make a mighty effort. By God, if thou wert to hear in this Tablet of inner meanings the spiritual utterance of this evanescent servant, surely thou wouldst lay thy head in the wilderness of extinction and become detached from soul and heart, and cast thy head at the feet of the Friend. How lofty is the flight of the Phoenix of love, and how short is our appeal! Soar a little, that by the grace of the Eternal King thou mayest find thy dwelling place, rising from the dust heap of nothingness unto the canopy of ancient days. Grant a wing to the holy spirit and bestow flight upon the inner soul, that it may soar in the atmosphere of divine nearness and reach the destination of the unseen. From this profitless sphere naught ariseth save poison, and from mortal pain no immortal draught floweth forth. Should the Spirit of Jesus hear from the royal falcon of the Kingdom the holy melody, surely He would cry out from the depth of His soul and, like the spirit of lovers, would be stirred to passionate ardor. The Moses of eternity was rendered unconscious by that call, and the Abraham of faithfulness, by that song, broke the idols of self. Therefore break thou the idol of self, that thou mayest take up abode in the hiding place of the Friend. Pass beyond passion, that thou mayest wing thy flight to the Egypt of immortality. Purify the city of the heart, that thou mayest behold the Beauty of the Divine Essence and become quickened by the Holy Spirit from spirit itself. No melody remaineth that was not sung upon this branch, and no song abideth that was not warbled by this Nightingale. A thousand Hijazi ears cannot comprehend this Persian lament, and none but a divine form can understand this wondrous theme. How blessed, then, is he who entereth this ocean and quaffeth therefrom the draught of life.\n\n=== END BH02382 ===\n\n=== START BH02383 ===\n\nIn the Name of the One God! O 'Ali!

Blessed is he who hath found the fragrance of the divine utterance and is among those who know. If thou wouldst hearken unto the Wronged One of the horizons, strive with complete detachment that thou mayest be illumined by the lights of the Sun of insight. In all matters look unto the Truth and place thy trust in Him. The Lord of Bounty and the Sovereign of existence will assuredly not deprive His servants, but will assist them in whatsoever profiteth them in this world and the next. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of grace that none of the peoples of the world hath been or is aware of their own best interests, for knowledge hath ever resided and shall continue to reside with the true Knower. He, verily, is the One Who knoweth what is with them, and what profiteth and preserveth them, while they know not. It behooveth everyone to say: \"Thou art the Knower of what is within me, and I know not what is within Thy Self, and Thou art, in truth, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" Such meanings from the All-Merciful were revealed in the Qur'an, and likewise in previous Books, as every discerning knower will testify.\n\n\\[Rest of text already translated above\\]\n\n=== END BH02383 ===\n\n=== START BH02384 ===\n\nBeware lest thou falter, then speak with wondrous power.

The day when the Sovereign of Eternity emerged from behind the veils of names and attributes, rent asunder the clouds of knowledge and tore apart the mists of wisdom, and without concealment or veil the Tongue of the Lord of Lords began to speak - in such wise that the oceans of meanings flowed from His blessed lips and the surging waves of utterance streamed forth from His life-giving words. Therefore today the dwellers in the heaven of glory must detach themselves from all else and speak forth with healing words, holy breaths, and the warbling of the Dove of transcendent majesty in the paradise of inner meanings, bringing the contingent world into a state of attraction, rapture and joy through wondrous melodies. O Javad, the Beauty possessed of bounty and grace commandeth: Rend asunder the veils of fancy and tear apart the curtains of silence. Like a lover bereft of patience, step forth from the city of forbearance. Let no barrier restrain thee, nor any word conceal thee. For in this year of tribulation, mention of which was made aforetime in the tablets of glory, the greatest tumult and severest calamity shall assuredly arise, such that infants shall be cut off from their mothers' breasts and lovers shall be barred from the cities of their Beloved. Perchance in those days and times that servant may hold fast to the grace of God and cling to the hem of His mercy, standing so firm and steadfast in the Cause of the Beloved that even should all the embodiments of hatred and the souls of opposition determine to turn him aside from the straight path of truth, they would be powerless and unable to do so. O manifestation of the name of Bounty! Plant firm the foot of steadfastness, for the winds of discord are blowing from the direction of schism with such force that thou shalt soon witness how they cut off the yellowed leaves from the divine Tree and cast them to the dust. Therefore, O verdant and flourishing leaf, hold fast to the Most Great Tree, that the Most Glorious and Noble Holy Spirit may keep thee, through the blowing of phantom winds and the passing of the breezes of associating partners with God, from being severed from the divine Tree. Rather mayest thou be stirred with such rapture and ecstasy that thy movements give rise to the melodies of truth in such wise that all faces turn to the countenance of thy Lord, all ears become attuned to the strains of thy Creator, and all hearts are prepared for the dawning of the sun of thy Maker. Thus have We ordained for thee from the power We bestowed upon thee in the form of words in this Book, that thou mayest be among those who are firm and steadfast in the Cause of thy Lord.\n\n=== END BH02384 ===\n\n=== START BH02385 ===\n\nIn the Name of the one true God! O Ali! It is most clear and evident that from the beginning this wronged and lonely one had no thought for himself, for had he been concerned with self-preservation or other stations, he would never have accepted the countless afflictions, calamities and trials. Every person of insight beareth witness that we summoned the people, for the sake of God alone, to the Dawning-Place of God's Cause and the Dayspring of His divine revelation. This most great bounty the leaders of nations have counted as sin and error, and have visited upon us that which the pen is powerless to recount. We shall be patient in God as we have been patient, and shall thank Him in all conditions. Now the hearts that have attained to the love of God and that gaze toward the horizon of His grace must strive with utmost joy and radiance, with mighty and sublime effort, to raise up the Word of the Lord of Religions. Through virtuous conduct, deeds, kindliness and conciliation they must draw the people of the world to the City of the All-Merciful. The one who today claims to love God must be distinguished from all others in every aspect. Mere acceptance of the Cause and acknowledgment of the truth is not and hath never been sufficient, even as all people today make such claims, yet the Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to their lies, calumnies, pride, heedlessness and treachery. O friends! Act purely for God's sake and speak solely for His sake. A word that ascendeth from the heaven of the heart and shineth forth from the horizon of the tongue for the sake of God will assuredly have effect. Be not heedless of the influence of deeds. By the life of God! Were a soul to become aware of the effects of good and evil words and deeds, he would never incline to any wrong, and naught but pure good and absolute virtue would proceed from him. Fear not the might of ignorant divines, and be not gladdened by worldly wealth. Soon shall God's irrevocable decree seize both and bring them to naught. God willing, ye must be the dawning-places of divine counsels among mankind, that through your advice the heedless may turn to the ocean of certitude and the manifest horizon. O thou who gazest upon the Face! We have sent down this Tablet unto thee that thou mayest remind the loved ones of its contents and give thanks to thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We have heard thy call and perceived the fragrance of thy love. He is the All-Powerful, the All-Encompassing. Grieve not over anything. Trust in God, the Lord of all worlds. He is with thee and ordaineth for thee that which shall profit thee in this world and the next. There is none other God but Him, the Most High, the Most Great. The glory rest upon thee and upon whomsoever hath turned to God, detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth. And praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH02385 ===\n\n=== START BH02386 ===\n\nThat which hath been revealed in the Tablets of loving counsel regarding unity and other matters hath been and will continue to be intended for all created things, both those who are round about Me and those in all lands. The knowledge of the True One encompasseth all things. That which hath streamed forth from the Most Ancient Pen hath been based upon observation of what was and what would be. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. O thou physician! Convey My glorification to the people of Zawra who have embarked upon the Crimson Ark by the leave of God, the Lord of all names. Blessed are they, inasmuch as they have migrated in the path of God, the Originator of earth and heaven. In their departure from Zawra there are signs for those possessed of understanding, and in their return there are clear tokens for those who have been heedless of their Lord's remembrance. Thus doth God single out whom He pleaseth through His grace. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Say: Be not grieved by that which hath befallen you. Ye have borne what I have borne. This is of God's grace - He bestoweth it upon whom He willeth, though the people are in doubt and behind a veil. Rend it asunder through wisdom and utterance. Thus hath it been ordained in the Tablets of your Lord, the All-Merciful. He, verily, is the One Who ordaineth what He willeth. God hath made you a sign of His remembrance amongst His servants, and this is of His grace upon you, O ye who are endued with insight. Blessed be your ears, for they have heard; and your hearts, for they have turned; and your faces, for they have been illumined by the lights of your Lord's countenance, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. We have read the letter of Our name Muhammad-Qabli-Mustafa and have turned toward him from this Horizon whence the daysprings have been made to shine. He hath been wronged by those who wander in the wilderness of heedlessness and forgetfulness. God shall soon exalt those who have desired His presence and seize such as have persisted in pride and discord. Upon them be the glory of God, the One, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Compelling. Thy likeness hath been honored to attain the presence of the Lord of Majesty, and this is yet another turn. We beseech God to make it one of the supreme examples in the kingdom of creation and to manifest through it that which thy Lord, the Lord of all names, hath desired. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Wise. We make mention of thee in the realms of eternity even as thou makest mention of Us among the peoples. To this beareth witness the Pen that moveth between the fingers of thy Lord's will, the Powerful, the Almighty. Excellent is that which thou hast inferred regarding him whom thou didst mention. He, verily, is the Protector of those who remember. He aideth him who speaketh by His command and openeth upon hearts the gates of knowledge. He, verily, is the Mighty, the All-Wise. Convey abundant greetings on behalf of the True One to all the loved ones in that land. Be vigilant in all regions regarding the Cause of God, lest any matter arise that might cause harm to the loved ones of that land, for these souls are known by the name of God and their protection is necessary in all circumstances. Let them not be saddened by the disruption of outward means. Verily, He enlargeth unto whom He willeth. In His hand is the dominion of all things. He ordaineth for whomsoever He desireth whatsoever He desireth.

A hundred thousand means appeared so that He might lead thee to the Most Great Bounty and the Mighty Announcement. For such a Lord befitteth praise and glorification, mention and laudation, grandeur and glory. In all the books He gave glad tidings to the world that the time would come when He Who conversed on Sinai would repair to the Sinai of manifestation. But when the effulgences of the morn of truth illumined the world with its rays, all were deprived and prevented - some were held back by learning, some by ignorance, some by wealth, and some by pride and vainglory. In any case, most of the people of the world remain heedless of that for which they were created and brought from nothingness into being. But thou hast attained. Give thanks unto thy Lord through the continuance of His dominion and His kingdom, His might and His glory, His bounty and His generosity, His mercy and His grace. Thy letter arrived some time ago and from it wafted the fragrance of steadfastness, acceptance and devotion. Praise be to God that the veils of prevention did not hinder thee and the clouds did not intervene. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions in such wise that thou shalt be gazing toward the horizon, speaking His praise, and standing firm in His Cause. Convey My greetings to the friends and say: \"Remembrance and glory be upon you, O My loved ones! We counsel you with that whereby the Cause of God and your stations among the servants may be exalted. Verily He is the Wise Counselor, the All-Knowing. Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Wise.\" We make mention of the honored aunt, upon her be the Glory of God, and the Greatest Holy Leaf and her sister, and give them the glad tidings of divine favor. They have ever been and continue to be beneath His gaze. Likewise We gladden the hearts of their relatives with the favors, bounty and mercy of God. In these days the letter of the leaf who is the daughter of the aunt, upon her be the Glory of God, and Aqa Siyyid Faraj'u'llah who had written in the name of Mahdi, upon him be My glory, attained the Most Holy Court. We beseech God to assist them both in that which He loveth and is pleased with, and to ordain for them the good of this world and the next.

Blessed art thou for having rent asunder the veils of glory and entered beneath the shadow of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Exalted, and sanctified thyself from the association of every stubborn polytheist. However, strive within thyself in all thy days lest the whisperings of Satan cause thee to slip and lead thee astray from the path of glorious might and from the straight and holy way. Shun those who have disbelieved, then convey the Cause of thy Lord to those in whose hearts thou findest the fragrance of holiness and in whose faces thou seest the radiance of a luminous glory. And if sorrow overtaketh thee, remember My sorrow and My tribulations. By God! I have been afflicted with trials which none can reckon save God Who encompasseth all things in the Mother Book. This is the Book which speaketh now with truth that there is no God but Him, and that He Who appeared with the name of Husayn before Ali is verily His sovereignty, His grandeur, His majesty, then His manifestation and His concealment, and His might and power over all created things. And then the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimeth from behind the Most Exalted Pavilion: By God! This is verily Ali, then Muhammad, then Muhammad, then Ali. Follow Him, O peoples of the earth, and associate not partners with Him, for this would be an injustice from your own selves against God. Fear God and be among the pious in the Cause. Do ye worship the calf and forsake Him Who created you by His command, by Whose light all who are in the heavens and earth are illumined, if ye be possessed of insight? O people! Purify your ears that ye may hear My melodies, then your eyes that ye may behold My beauty. Thus hath God commanded you in all the Tablets and in this Tablet which hath appeared and shone forth from the horizon of the finger of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Exalted, and God is witness unto this. O servant! Hear My call, then stand firm in the Cause and turn not unto what hath been created in the realm of origination. We have ordained for thee in the Tablet an exalted station, and We have reckoned what is in thy heart and are aware of what is in thy secret thoughts, and We shall decree for thee what We have intended for thee, and with Us is the knowledge of all things and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, if thou be informed thereof. And the glory be upon thee and upon those with thee and upon those who have remained steadfast in this Cause wherefrom have slipped the feet of those in whose hearts was doubt concerning the meeting with their Lord and who were far removed from the path.\n\n=== END BH02388 ===\n\n=== START BH02389 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty, the Everlasting, the All-Praised!\n\nThese are the holy verses which have been sent down in truth from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Beware lest ye shut the gates of divine good-pleasure against your faces and deny the verses of God at the time they are sent down unto you. Fear ye God and reject not His verses, nor be of them that are veiled.\n\nSay: O people! Know ye that God created what is in the Bayan for the manifestation of His handiwork and the revelation of His grace and the exaltation of His Word, if ye be of them that understand. And He commanded them not to reject him who would come unto them with the truth on the Day when He would come with the truth - a Day which none can avert - and this is the decree of One mighty and knowing. And that they should not do unto him as they did unto this Servant - this hath been inscribed in holy and resplendent Tablets.\n\nYet ye, O people of the Bayan, by God, ye do unto him that which none hath ever done unto anyone, and this is assuredly the truth made certain, even as ye did unto His Servant after He came unto you with a manifest sovereignty which the peoples of the heavens and earth are powerless to produce the like thereof. And ye imagine within yourselves even as imagined they who were before you. Woe unto you, O company of evil-doers!\n\nKnow ye that this Tablet shall itself be God's proof against you and His evidence unto all creation. Whoso turneth aside from it hath turned aside from God in His Manifestations, the Prophets and Messengers, and God will accept naught from anyone except that he believe in this Tablet, even should he worship Him unto all eternity. Thus do We impart unto you, O people of the Bayan, that which I have been commanded by God, the Almighty, the Powerful. Whoso wisheth, let him turn aside; and whoso wisheth, let him take unto God his Lord a way.\n\nAnd thou, O Letter M, give thanks unto God thy Creator for that We have sent down unto thee this mighty Tablet and mentioned thy name on this blessed night which glorieth over a brilliant dawn. Then know thou that We have commanded thee to dwell in the city whose name is renowned among all peoples, and to protect those servants who enter therein from among the loved ones of God, the Most High, the Great. Thus have We bestowed Our favor upon thee in this Tablet that thou mayest thank God thy Lord at all times.

Thus have We sent down the Command in this Tablet as a remembrance from Us to all the worlds. Verily, they who have denied the signs of God in these days have indeed denied the Manifestations of God's Self in every age and dispensation, and their names shall not be mentioned before their Lord, nor shall any holy and mighty glance be turned toward them. And thou, O leader of the people, hearken unto the call of God from this crimson Tree upon this blessed, most holy, eternal and radiant Spot. God, there is no God but Him. He hath created all things for the knowledge of His Self and brought forth all existence to follow His Command - thus hath it been aforetime and will ever be, if thou be of them that know. Among the people are those who have drunk the cup of recognition and those who have turned away from God even after verses were sent down unto them morning and evening. Know thou that We have been tried among Our servants who believed not in God from all eternity, in whose breasts the fire of hatred was kindled, who returned upon their heels in rejection with manifest tyranny. Sorrows have encompassed Us to such degree that My tongue is powerless to make mention of My Beloved. Thus hath it befallen the Youth in these days, if thou be of them that are informed. Were the servants to possess attentive ears, what hath been sent down unto them from the mighty and holy dominion would suffice them. But without this they will not turn to the words of God nor hear His sweet melodies, even were verses of manifest glory to descend upon them at every moment like unto rain. Say: O people, fear God and war not against His Self, nor dispute His signs after they have been sent down in truth and have encompassed all in the worlds together. Hearken unto the call of God, then detach yourselves from all else - this is better for you than the treasures of the heavens and earth, if ye be of them that know and see. And thou, be steadfast in the Cause of God thy Lord. Beware lest the promptings of Satan cause thee to slip, for he hath risen against the face of the All-Merciful with a rejection that was grievous in the Mother Book. Be firm in the Cause, then remind thyself throughout all days, and if thou art able, convey the Cause of thy Lord to those whom thou findest today in heedlessness and distant schism. Thus doth the Tongue of Grandeur make mention of thee, that thou mayest follow what thou art commanded and be steadfast in thy Lord's Cause.

Those who denied their Lord aforetime - We seized them for their sins and made them a lesson for those who perceive. Soon shall We seize those who followed their tyranny. Verily thy Lord is the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, yet the people perceive not. We have detailed all things in the Book as a mercy from Us to people who know. We delivered those who believed and left the idolaters in the abyss of divine wrath. In this are signs for people who understand. Say: Do ye hasten on the punishment when signs have already come before you and We seized thereby those who denied God, the Mighty, the Loving? Reflect on those who came before you - they were seized for their deeds and they understood not. We seized no people until after God's proof and evidence were perfected against them. Thy Lord is indeed gracious to mankind, yet mankind perceive not. Those who fabricate lies against God shall never prosper. We shall seize them from every direction, then cast them into the fire for their unbelief. Say: O people! Do ye shun Him Who draws you nigh unto God and forbids you from following false gods? Break the idols by My sovereignty and turn to the Dawning-Place of My signs - this is better for you, did ye but know. He who calls you to himself instead of God has indeed denied God, the Mighty, the Beloved. We called him from the direction of grandeur: Hasten thou unto Us and be not of those whom passion hath seized and kept back from God, the Creator of names. But he turned away as did those of old. Blessed is he who fulfills God's covenant and His pledge, and takes for himself a path to the praiseworthy station. Say: Beware lest ye worship images like unto yourselves. Worship ye the one God - We are His worshippers. Remember God's grace when ye were in the wilderness of error - He brought you forth by the truth and made you of the guided ones. We sent down the Bayan and made it glad tidings for mankind lest they stray from the path. But when the promise came to pass and the Promised One appeared, they turned away save those on whose faces thou seest the radiance of divine bounty. When it is said to them \"By what proof did ye believe in God?\" they say \"The Bayan.\" Yet when its Revealer came to them they denied the All-Merciful. Lo! they are among the losers. Say: The Bayan was revealed for My sake and was adorned with My remembrance. Were it not for Me, not a single letter thereof would have been revealed, as attesteth he who hath opened his eyes by God's light, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Arise to mention thy Lord amongst the servants, then draw them by the signs of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Turn away from what they say and hold fast to this wise Remembrance.

One blessing requires one tongue to give thanks and praise for it. But before any person of insight, the inability of one tongue to mention millions upon millions of favors is clear and manifest. Christ (upon Him be God's mercy), after much trouble and reflection, in one breath investigated two bounties, thereby proving human inability - and indeed He made an excellent investigation, as though He had attained unto a drop from the ocean of utterance. But now we observe that we have one tongue while hundreds of thousands upon thousands of worlds and more of bounties and favors exist. In this case, our inability requires no investigation - it is as evident as the sun. And it is hoped that this very acknowledgment of inability will be accepted.

Furthermore, praise be to God, the letter arrived and notice of receipt was sent. They said that his honor Haji Shaykh (upon him be God's peace and favor) has taken much trouble. Accordingly, he is continuously occupied with services - his reward is with God. Two days ago they brought a rosewater sprinkler with rosewater into His presence. They used it and mentioned Jinab-i-Shaykh. The point is that you have been and are in His thoughts at all times. As for the mention of that beloved one's stay in the palace, it is quite clear that that beloved one did not notice the subtle, nay most subtle, hint of Aqa Mirza Aminullah (may my spirit be sacrificed for him), otherwise he would certainly have stayed. After this was submitted, He smiled and said \"Although the compensation is with them, We shall pay it and will inform when the time comes.\" As for what you wrote about your mention being made in the Most Holy Court - praise be to God, mention of that beloved one is ever-present. Your handwritten books are before His face, occupied with your mention, and likewise your presence and your service in the realm of writing and otherwise - all are manifest.

Thou didst advance and traverse the path until thou didst reach the valley of certitude and didst hear the Call from the Blessed Tree beyond which there is no passing: \"Verily He is God, there is none other God but Him. His is the praise and the glory, His the grandeur and the splendor.

The remembrance of God unto His servant who was named Isma'il, that it may be unto him an honor, a remembrance and a glory. O servant, grieve not at hardships and trials. Be content with what God hath ordained for thee, for He is the best Helper and Succourer. After every difficulty, in the Mother Book there hath been ordained, in truth, facility. All that hath befallen thee hath befallen thy Beloved, but the people are in great heedlessness. God's curse be upon him who hath usurped your rights and deprived you of what was created for you, for whatsoever is on earth was created for the loved ones of God and His chosen ones. Thus hath the matter been decreed by One Who is mighty and wise. Those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the path of God, God will surely punish them for what they have hoarded - and who is more truthful in speech than God? This is the inner meaning, but outwardly the property of others is forbidden unto you. Beware lest ye deal treacherously with any soul or dispose of their property without their leave. This indeed is a grievous error in the Book. Dear is it to Me, O My loved ones, that I should enjoy aught of God's bounties and favors while I behold you in manifest hardship. And dear is it to Me that I should be in one land while you are in another land, and this is hard upon Me and upon every seeing lover. But We have acquiesced to God's good-pleasure and decree, and I counsel you to beautiful patience. We beseech God to seize those who have come between Us and Our loved ones and scattered the leaves from the Tree, for He hath power over all things. Then We beseech Him to send down upon you that which will gladden your hearts and gather Us and you together in a praiseworthy station of truth. Beware lest ye grieve at what hath befallen you in this earthly life. By God! He hath ordained for you what none can reckon save God your Lord, and He hath ever been the Counter of all things in a preserved Tablet. Soon shall this world pass away, and there shall remain for you of the wonders of His bounty that which shall cause you to endure with His endurance, and this is a mighty grace in the Book. Thus have We conferred upon thee and made mention of thee that thou mayest thank God thy Lord in all conditions and be content with His good-pleasure at all times.

They have grasped the firm cord of \"God is the light of the heavens and the earth\" and have held fast to the hem of the exception \"My earth and My heaven contain Me not.\" Their remoteness is the essence of nearness and their separation the very spirit of union.

But after being drawn by the detailed word which is engaged in mending and rending among creation, from one direction would rise the cry of lovers in complete attraction and yearning, while from another the clamor of the people of hatred would be raised in utter rejection and rebellion. In such case the veils of wisdom would be rent asunder. Therefore We revealed it in measure. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Life and Life of the worlds!

They committed that which caused the denizens of Paradise and the holy precincts to lament, as attested by the Mother Book in the final abode. Throughout ages and centuries they were occupied in cursing one another while speaking of the Qa'im and uttering \"may God hasten His advent.\" But when the Sun of Manifestation shone forth from the horizon of the world and the One Who conversed on Sinai issued His call, the divines one and all, along with their followers, arose to curse and revile the Point of Existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen. Finally they issued the verdict for the shedding of His most pure blood.\n\nReflection is needed on the ranks of knowledge of the divines from the beginning of Islam until the Day of Manifestation.

The first is: forget yourselves and be intimate with God, the Powerful, the Living, the Manifest. And the second is: turn away from all that distracts you from your Creator, then advance toward a holy and exalted shore. Thus does the Dove teach you when it flew from Iraq through what the hands of the oppressors had wrought before and what they continue to perpetrate. Say: The tree of sorrow has once again been planted in the soul of Husayn, whereby the pillars of existence have been shaken. Say: The tradition has returned and God's way has been renewed in His own self, if you but knew. Say: O people of the earth, rejoice not at what hath befallen Us, nor be gladdened by what God hath ordained for Us, for there shall come upon you the torment of a promised day. Say: By God, were you to sense within yourselves less than a moment thereof, you would cry out, then instantly fall upon your faces for what you wrought in the days of the Spirit while turning away from Him. Say: This indeed is Husayn in truth, and His intimacy with tribulations is as the intimacy of the lover with the beloved. He fears no one even if all the powerful and mighty were to gather against Him - this is a known truth. Say: Whoso fears God fears no one, and whoso knows God knows none beside Him and is content with Him apart from all else. To this do the angels of the Cause bear witness, and beyond them this holy and manifest Pen wherein are ordained the mysteries of knowledge and wisdom, and wherein is known what has been and what will be. Say: By God, were this Pen to desire to move or transform you with but a letter, it would be able to do so in less than the twinkling of an eye, did you but know. But it desires naught save what God, the King, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved, hath desired, that He might thereby distinguish those who have hastened to the shore of holiness from those who hasten to the valley of self. Say: He who is detached unto God is instantly touched by tribulations at every moment, yet his yearning increases for he hath tasted the love of God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Thus have We detailed for you in this Tablet that which will cause your breasts to boil with the heat of love and transform you toward a praiseworthy right hand, that your hearts might find peace thereby and your inner beings find rest, such that nothing will disturb you in the Cause, and you will be as firmly-fixed mountains.

O Lord! By Thy might and majesty, were I to find for myself at every moment a life to sacrifice it for Thy Self, it would be little compared to the manifestation of Thy bestowals and the appearance of Thy gifts. I beseech Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven, to make me steadfast in Thy Cause, turning unto Thee, detached from all else besides Thee. Then ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for the sincere ones among Thy creatures and the unified ones among Thy loved ones.

This is a Tablet which God hath verily revealed at this time with truth and made it a proof for all the worlds. Verily it is in itself a manifest Book, a revelation from God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Beautiful. Therein hath God comprised the knowledge of the former and the latter generations, and ordained therein consummate wisdom whereof not a single letter can be comprehended by all who are in the heavens and on earth, save whom God willeth. This is of God's bounty unto all created things. Say: Verily it is the Mother Book, for naught is seen therein save God and His Cause, if ye be of them that comprehend. And verily it is the Mother of Tablets, for from it have been detailed the tablets of God, the Dominant, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: Were God to will it, He would expound from a single point thereof all that hath passed in former ages and all that shall come to pass throughout the eternity of God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing. O people of the earth! Sanctify your souls and purify your hearts that ye may thereby recognize that which lieth concealed in the treasuries of infallibility from One mighty and powerful. Say: The likeness of your hearts is as the likeness of water, if ye be of them that understand. Verily water remaineth pure until it is mixed with clay, and when mixed with clay its purity departeth and its delicacy vanisheth, such that none can perceive what God hath deposited within it, both outwardly and inwardly, if ye be of them that observe. O people of the Bayan! Strive within yourselves lest the clay of desires become mixed with the water of your being. Fear God and be of the God-fearing. Sanctify yourselves from the clay of self and passion that there may appear from you what God hath deposited within you of precious pearls of glory. Thus do We set forth for you every similitude that ye may ponder the signs of God within the horizons of wisdom and within yourselves, and be of them that are endowed with insight. O people of the Bayan! Behold the handiwork of God with your own eyes and be not content with hearsay. This is the most excellent utterance and the most eloquent remembrance from Me unto you, if ye be of them that hearken. Had ye heard this Cause aforetime, ye would have recognized the Ancient Beauty when He walked among you with a step of mighty glory, and ye would not have deprived yourselves of Him and His recognition, nor would ye have withheld yourselves from this wondrous bounty which no one's knowledge hath encompassed and of whose appearance no heart among the peoples of the world hath been informed. Therefore grieve not for what hath escaped you, but await the day wherein trials shall come upon you from every near quarter. At that time, remain steadfast in My love and My Cause in such wise that your feet shall not slip in less than a moment. This is better for you than all that ye have wrought in your days concerning the kingdom of the heavens and earth.

Thus was the matter ordained by the All-Knowing Ordainer. The husband's fate had outwardly been concealed but later it was confirmed that he had attained martyrdom.

Remember her on My behalf and give her the glad tidings of God's mercy and grace which have encompassed all in the heavens and earth. She may choose as she wishes according to God's Book, the Lord of the worlds. The law of waiting was revealed when the husband's fate was concealed, but after its discovery to act according to what is revealed in God's Book was and is beloved. Praise be to God, through this means she attained the mention of God, exalted be His glory.

And We remember him who was named Muhammad-Taqi for whom I desired his Lord's favor, and We ask God to forgive him as a grace from Him and remit his sins.

The Self-Subsisting has arisen, and the people have risen against Him in opposition - a opposition that caused the dwellers of Paradise to lament, and behind them the Concourse on High and those who circle round the Throne at morn and eventide. The servant present before Me has presented thy letter before the Face, whereupon the Most Exalted Pen raised its shrill voice and mentioned thee in such wise as nothing in the world can equal, as testified by the Mother Book which is with Him. We have called the servants to the supreme Paradise - among them are those who have heard and hastened, and those who turned away from Him Whose appearance God had promised in the Scriptures and Tablets. Grieve not at the people and their deeds. Look and remember what befell Muhammad, the Apostle of God, aforetime when He arose and called the people to God, the Lord of Lords. Then remember when the Spirit came before Him - the Jews rose against Him with such oppression as caused the hearts of the chosen ones to tremble and the livers of the pure ones to melt. Thus was the matter decreed aforetime and in these days which God has associated with His Self. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Then look before Him at Moses when He came with His Lord's signs, and the people turned away from Him on that day and denied God's Cause after its manifestation and committed that which caused the clouds to cry out. He gave the people glad tidings of the days of God and what would appear therein. Blessed are they who heard and responded, and woe unto every doubting denier. By the life of God! No Messenger was sent and no Book was revealed except to give glad tidings to creation of this Manifestation through which the very corners of possibility smiled. But when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Promise came and the Promised One appeared, the servants in all directions denied Him. Say: O people! Fear God and deny not Him in Whom ye believed throughout past ages and centuries. Cast behind your backs the divines of the age and hasten to the City of Divine Knowledge, whose gates have been opened by this Name through which the Resurrection has come, the Trumpet has been blown, the Cry has been raised, the Balance has been set up, and the heaven has brought forth smoke. Thus have We sent down the verses and dispatched them to thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord by night and day, at eventide and dawn. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon those whom neither the cannons of princes frightened nor the intimations of the divines who enter the mosques in My name yet turn away from Me in such wise as caused all things to lament, and whatsoever was created by the Word of God, the Lord of creation.\n\n=== END BH02423 ===\n\n=== START BH02424 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him through Whom the fragrance of My loving-kindness hath been wafted among My servants!

And We permitted Ali of Kashan what he desired on condition that you do not strengthen them with a third. They must engage in their work silently and quietly. They are not to speak about any matter. We beseech God to protect them and assist them in what He loves and is pleased with.\" End quote. O beloved of my heart, the servant wishes to expend an island of pens and an ocean of ink in your remembrance and praise and your arising to serve the Cause, but has not found the opportunity. The matter is in the hand of God, the Lord of creation and Dawning-Place of the light of oneness. And at the end of the letter the servant sends greetings upon his eyes and tongue and limbs and pillars and the fragrances of his heart and the radiance of his brow - Abbas and Haji Ali from T and Haji Ali from K and Mirza Husayn and Muhammad Ibrahim and the other brothers, upon them be the peace of the All-Merciful. And I beseech Him by the One through whom He illumined the world to draw them near to Him in all conditions and assist them in His remembrance and praise and in acting according to what they were commanded in His Book. And I end my words with mention of the delight of eyes, Husayn Effendi and his brothers. And peace and mercy and glory be upon your honor and upon the righteous servants of God.

The servant hath attained to that which was the dawning-place of joy and gladness and the treasury of remembrance and praise. When he drank from his words the wine of mystical knowledge, he approached the Most Exalted Station and presented it before His presence. The Lord, may our spirits be a sacrifice for Him, said:\n\n\"O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of nearness and reunion! Thy letter hath repeatedly come before the Wronged One. We have read it and made mention of thee with a mention that illumineth the eyes.

Were it not for him, the mysteries of eternity would not have been revealed nor would the fragrances of revelation have been diffused among the nations. Through him God manifested His Cause and enacted His decree. This Most Great Remembrance and Manifestation of Eternity deserves praise from those immersed in the depths of divine knowledge and remembrance from the Manifestations of the Cause throughout all lands.

The servant has attained to that which shone forth from the horizon of your love. When the joy of your words and the delight of your mention took hold of me, I beseeched God, the Lord of the seen and unseen, that He may assist your honor in all good that guides the servants to the path of wisdom and acquaints them with the ways of kindness and care, and that He may grant them the good of this world and the next. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nAs for what your honor mentioned regarding what his eminence the Trustworthy - upon him be the peace of God, the Lord of all worlds - desired, it behooves us to consider what the Master has uttered. He - may my spirit be His sacrifice - said: \"We desire to purify hearts from rancor and hatred, that thereby the standard of unity may be raised in the kingdom of creation.\" The servant beseeches his Lord to assist his eminence in what He loves and is pleased with, and in that which unites hearts, attracts souls, and brings joy to eyes.\n\nAnd as for what you mentioned about the Prisoner - upon him be God's peace - his eminence is remembered and regarded. The servant sends greetings upon him and upon the loved ones, and asks forgiveness from your honor because this ephemeral one delayed in sending a copy of what was sent to him. And from Him I ask for assistance in all conditions. God willing, he sends peace, remembrance and praise upon your honor and upon the friends who have returned from the Sacred House of God and attained what God desired in the Book, and upon his eminence Husayn Effendi and those who bring joy to eyes and your family and upon the unified loved ones of God.

One Most Holy Tablet specifically for the beloved of the heart, His Honor Mirza ?.Y., upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious, has been sent. God willing, he will attain to it. Permission to come has also been given to him.\n\nThe servant begs his Lord to assist your honor in all conditions and protect you from the evil of those who have denied God and turned away from His path and disputed His verses until they pronounced judgment against Him with manifest injustice.\n\nTo the honored gentlemen in that land, upon them be His most glorious splendor, I present my utter effacement and nothingness.

Since it was intended that some work should be sent for the honored lady, the reply was somewhat delayed outwardly, for praise be to God, through His grace and favor you have been and continue to be mentioned in all nights and days in the Most Luminous Presence. Two most pure garments of the Twin Resplendent Lights - may my spirit and the spirit of all the worlds be sacrificed for them - were sent specifically to comfort the heart of the honored lady, along with one tailored harkay garment for Inayatu'llah, Hibatu'llah, Vaffaqahu'llah and Ayyadahu'llah, and thirty-seven pieces of almond candy. We beseech God to grant you its inner sweetness just as He has granted you its outer sweetness.\n\nFurthermore, convey pure greetings and radiant salutations to that honored beloved, namely the esteemed Khalil - upon him be 966 \\[Baha'u'llah\\], Lord of nations.

And likewise remember the female believers and Aqa 'Abdu's-Samad and the children with goodly mention from this servant. Mention to the esteemed Khalil: May God protect us and you and then the company of those who drink this accursed tea! In truth if one dirham of it were to be sprinkled over all of China it would transform all of it. The tea that was first sent by that honored one bore no resemblance or relation whatsoever.

Light and spirit and mercy and glory be upon you, O manifestation of devotion and dawning-place of faithfulness among all peoples. I bear witness that through you the banner of polytheism was brought low and the standard of divine unity was raised to the most exalted station. You are the one who emigrated with the Wronged One in the path of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, on a day when the sky brought forth smoke and earthquakes seized the foundations of all in creation. You are the one whom the might of the oppressors did not weaken, nor were you veiled by the veils of the transgressors. You turned to the Most Exalted Horizon when most of humanity turned away from it. Through your mention the scrolls of the lovers were adorned in the love of God, Illuminer of the horizons and Lord of the Day of Meeting. Through your certitude the limbs of vain imaginings trembled, and through the light of your divine unity the foundations of the polytheists were shaken - those who denied the Cause of God when He came with proof and evidence. Blessed are you and joy be unto you in that you attained the recognition of your Lord on a day when God came in the shadows of clouds. And I remember at this time the dawn of a day when the Manifestation of \"He doeth whatsoever He willeth\" mounted a blue horse, heading toward the Ultimate Goal for the victory of God, Lord of Names and Creator of heaven. You were with Me along with a few souls and we traversed the way until we arrived at one of the villages. Then the oppressors surrounded us from all directions and seized us with such tyranny that the livers of the most exalted Paradise melted, and the highest Paradise and the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing lamented. Alas! Alas! There befell you in the path of God that which caused the tears of the sincere ones to flow and the sighs of those near to God to ascend. You are the one through whom wafted the breezes of love and fellowship, and through whom shone forth the sun of harmony and unity. You stood firm in the Cause such that the horsemen in the field of tyranny and oppression did not frighten you, nor did the fire blazing in all regions prevent you. Through your calamity eyes wept, hearts burned, and the pillars of existence were shaken. We beseech God, Lord of the unseen and the visible, to ordain for you at all times that which befits His name, the All-Merciful. He is the Mighty, the All-Bountiful. Blessed is the seeker who seeks your tomb, and the lover who visits your grave and recites what the tongue of your Lord has uttered. O God, O God of all contingent beings and Goal of all created things! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the All-Forgiving, which has encompassed the manifestations of disobedience, and by Thy pardon which has preceded all religions, and by Thy grace which has taken hold of all in existence, to forgive whoever presents himself before his grave and to fulfill his needs.

I have created all things for My Name and have raised them up through My sovereignty, and I call unto them from this luminous Quarter. Blessed is he who hath turned unto Him and cast away all else - he is indeed among the sincere ones. Say: O people, if ye be fair in this Cause - should ye deny the Manifestation of God, His sovereignty, His proof and His evidence - by what proof do ye uphold that which ye possess? Bring it forth if ye be of the truthful. Nay, by Him Who hath caused Me to speak the truth, there is no path for anyone except this Path which We have revealed in truth. By God, this is verily the Most Great Path among the nations and the Most Straight Way for those in the heavens and on earth. The imaginary hath vanished through the dawning of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and that which was known hath come with a wondrous command. Say: This is indeed His Most Great Mystery among you, and His Book within you, and His proof unto you. Ponder upon it that ye may recognize the Temple of God which ye were promised in a preserved and mighty Tablet. The Dove hath warbled that which the Spirit uttered and that which Muhammad, the Messenger of God, brought. Were ye to inhale the fragrance of all the Books, ye would find from them naught but the sweet scent of My wondrous Name. Those who have been kept back from the Path are indeed among the bewildered ones. Look not at the size of their turbans nor the swaying of their necks - they are indeed among the losers. Blessed is the learned one who hath not been veiled, and the ignorant one who hath recognized his Lord, and the woman who hath rent asunder the veils. Thus have We imparted unto thee the truth that thou mayest be among those who know. Say: Hearken unto My call when My lamentation is raised and My heart doth groan by reason of what hath befallen Me at the hands of the oppressive hosts. Know thou that My tribulation is greater than can be reckoned. To this testifieth the Lord of destiny and the dwellers of the Most Great Scene who have witnessed somewhat of that which We have endured in the path of God, the King, the Most High, the Most Great. Were I not to fix My gaze upon the Command of God, I would not have uttered a word nor would I have spoken a letter of that which I have been commanded by the presence of One mighty and generous. By My life! The Tablet hath well-nigh taken flight through the wafting breaths of the verses of thy Lord. Blessed is he who hath found and rendered thanks. Woe unto those who have turned away. O servant! Take fast hold of the cord of God. We have indeed manifested it in the form of a Tablet. Thy Lord is verily the Strong, the Powerful. When thou dost inhale My fragrance from the garment of My utterance, arise from thy place, turning toward the direction of thy Lord. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my Beloved and the Beloved of the worlds! I testify that through Thee the suns have shone forth, the moons have appeared, and the faces of those near unto Thee have been illumined. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy love in such wise that the words of the deluded ones and the signs of the heedless ones shall not keep me back from Thee.

This is that trust which none was capable of bearing save those whom thy Lord hath willed - they are the loved ones and chosen ones of God who have become the manifestations of His decrees and the dawning-places of His trials. Therefore one must console the heart through patience and trust. Moreover, beyond these afflictions there is the matter of separation which hath entirely blocked the path of attainment and meeting, such that hope hath been transformed into despair, as though this separation and parting shall not be followed by the glad-tidings of the sweet breezes of reunion and nearness. This is among the greatest afflictions of the spirit. In any case, we hope that, God willing, all these sorrows shall be transformed into joy and delight. Verily He is the Guardian of the doers of good.\n\nThese are afflictions in which we all share. However, such trials have befallen this servant that none hath the power to bear them - neither the heavens nor the earth, neither the Manifestations of the Divine Unity nor the Dawning-Places of Divine Singleness. O My handmaiden! Give thanks unto God that He hath concealed this from thee, for wert thou to become aware of it, thou wouldst surely lose all patience and composure. Yet despite all this, We remain patient and thankful, and are among the grateful ones.\n\nFurthermore, what can Maryam do about the separation from that nightingale which hath taken flight from the rose-garden? Though in truth the effects of grief are apparent in all things and evident throughout all existence, yet patience hath been and will ever be most beloved, for that nightingale hath winged its flight to the holy precincts of Paradise. This earthly realm is as thou seest - naught exists therein save sorrow, grief and material troubles. Therefore pure hearts tarry not but return to their own station. God willing, He will graciously bestow an even sweeter and more glorious successor.\n\nAt this moment grief hath so encompassed Me that I am unable to write more. Unto God do I commit My affairs and your affairs, and verily He is the Guardian of those who trust in Him.

All were created by His command and all act according to His bidding.

And whoso entereth beneath His shadow hath attained unto the ultimate goal, and this verily is His grace unto all creation, would ye but understand. Say: He is God's Balance amidst His creation, and through Him hath appeared every true measure. He is God's Proof, His Evidence, His Testament and His Authority amongst His creatures, would ye but know. Through Him were revealed the mysteries of what was and what is to be, through Him did the earth yield up her pearls, and all things were brought forth by His word \"Be\" and it is. Through Him were ordained the measures of all things and detailed exposition of destiny was set down upon a preserved and mighty tablet.\n\nThus have We imparted unto thee, inspired thee, taught thee and sent down unto thee that which was sent down from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, that thou mayest thank God thy Lord in thy heart and remember Him at all times and attain unto a praiseworthy station. Know thou moreover that the two calves did transgress against God in these two Names and these two most ancient Ornaments in the two most exalted Words, and they betrayed themselves in their heedlessness of these two Mysteries in this Light that hath shone forth from these two Horizons. By God! This is the Beauty manifest in these two hidden and concealed Symbols that are glorified in both worlds, and this is the Mystery veiled in the two veils. They followed the two goats with their own selves after We had forbidden their approach unto the two idols in the two Temples. Behold then the veil of this clemency that hath risen and appeared from the two Dawning-Places, and that speaketh in the two Mounts in the form of the two Fires, and uttereth the two most perfect Words at the pole of the two heavens. Say: By God! This is indeed the Light manifest in the two Suns rising from the two Corners after the folding up of the two Stations, that thereby might be revealed the melodies of the Spirit upon the two Branches, that thou mayest know the decree concerning treachery in the two most remote selves. Thus have We stirred the veils of concealment less than anyone might perceive save they who see with the eye of God. Say: By God! This is the Dove that singeth with two melodies in the divine Ridvan concerning the two Mysteries from these two Garments. And We bear witness that there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Supreme, the Exalted, the Beloved.

Through Him appeared the Kingdom of Names and Attributes, and by Him was distinguished every irrevocable decree from God, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. All that returneth unto God or is attributed to Him doth verily return unto this Hidden Name, and through it is established God's Cause and its manifestation, and God's proof and evidence unto all who dwell in the kingdom of Command and Creation. To this do my soul and pen bear witness, and every possessor of assured knowledge.\n\nKnow thou that God hath ever been manifest amongst His servants and visible amidst His creation, yet people recognize Him not, for in every Revelation they become veiled by limited signs and tokens which prevent them from beholding the countenance of God in another Manifestation, would ye but understand. This is a truth in which there is no doubt, if ye would but look with this vision. Whosoever desireth to know God and His Self must needs purify his ear from every utterance, mention, and expression, and from every word that hath been spoken, and must gaze upon God with a perceiving eye, a pure heart, a hearing ear, and an attracted soul, that he may know his Lord through what appeareth from Him and not through what is with the people. This verily is the beloved truth, for naught else can serve as proof of Him, and every limited soul is veiled from Him.\n\nKnow thou further that thy Lord God will never appear according to what the people possess nor according to the signs and tokens to which they cling, but rather He appeareth as He willeth through His command. He, verily, is the One Who chooseth for Himself, and all beseech His bounty. Thus learn thou the mysteries of the Cause, lest thy feet slip from every rejected mention. When the people of the Furqan clung to the signs, proofs and tokens they possessed, they opposed God, the Supreme, the Witnessed One. Do thou remind those of thy kindred of what We have mentioned unto thee, that they may all turn unto the countenance of God that hath appeared among them, may recognize that wherewith God hath favored them, and may be of those who are thankful for God's blessing. We beseech God to aid them in this, such that none among them shall remain save that he entereth the paradise of God, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting. For this did We petition God in former years and do We petition Him now, and He, verily, is the Answerer, the Giver, the Bestower, the Forgiving.\n\n=== END BH02438 ===\n\n=== START BH02439 ===\n\nO Rida!

Then open thine eyes that thou mayest know what God hath willed in these days wherein faces are transformed, wherein the clamor of the deceivers is raised, and wherein every hidden matter from God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Beloved, is made manifest.\n\nVerily thou wert in Our presence for numbered years and didst hear the melodies of God from this blessed, sublime and praiseworthy Tune. Yet thou didst not recognize Us at any time, nor didst thou turn thy face toward Me, as vain imaginings veiled thee and prevented thee from entering the sanctuary of the Desired One. Therefore, arise from thy station, then witness the handiwork of God with thine own eyes, and follow not those who deny this bounty.\n\nSay: By God! Whoso denieth this Cause hath denied all the Messengers of the past. This is assuredly inscribed by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. We have sent thee this Tablet that thine eyes may be solaced thereby, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself, and be of those who take delight in the words of God. Know thou that a single letter thereof is better than the kingdom of the hereafter and of the former time, if ye would but behold the verses of God with His vision.\n\nTherefore, strive within thyself lest thy feet slip from this exalted and extended Path. Say: By God! The heaven hath been cleft asunder from the clouds of the Cause, and God hath come with the promised countenance wherewith ye were promised in the Nine, were ye to know. And a single Tablet from His trace is God's proof unto His creation, His evidence unto His creatures, and His authority unto all who are in the heavens and the earth, were ye to perceive.\n\nThus have We inspired thee that thou mayest burn away the veils of idle fancy and be of those whom no hinderer can hinder and no servants who have opposed God in every age can veil, who have denied the signs of God. The Spirit be upon thee and upon those in thy household, both female and male. And if thou findest a pure heart, cast upon it what We have cast upon thee; otherwise, conceal it with the utmost concealment.

Verily it shall suffice thee above all things and make thee independent of all that are in the heavens and on earth. Be thou a distributor of that which descendeth from the direction of the Throne upon Our assured servants, and a breaker of the might of them that have disbelieved and turned away and were among the proud ones. That which descendeth from the direction of the Throne is what We have now revealed in this Tablet and sent unto thee, that thou mayest recite it unto thyself and unto the souls of the servants, that perchance the people may become of them that remember. Know thou moreover that in every letter of the verses are ordained treasuries of bounty, and for every soul there is a portion thereof. Blessed is he who taketh what is ordained for him and rendereth not himself among the deprived ones. Apart from this, none can draw nigh unto the Throne - how then could any be a distributor of that which appeareth from it and descendeth from its direction? Glorified be God, thy Lord, above the understanding of all created things! Arise to make mention of God and to spread His Cause, and follow not the ways of the corrupt ones. Beware lest thou draw nigh unto them whose hearts thou findest veiled from the mention of the name of thy Lord, and associate not with them in any place, and be of them who have detached themselves from such as have disbelieved in the signs of God, the Inaccessible, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Then remember thou the time when thou didst enter the Paradise of the All-Highest, the seat of the throne of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great, and didst abide beneath the shadow of His mercy for numbered days, and wert among those upon whom shone the Sun of Beauty from the horizon of the Face, and who were among the triumphant ones - they who attained His presence and circled round His house at every morn and eventide. Therefore remind the people of what thou hast seen and known, that they may remember within themselves and be of the assured ones. Stand thou firm in the Cause at the time when every soul shall raise its cry and the pillars of the idolaters shall quake. Thus have We commanded thee in this Tablet that thou mayest be steadfast in the Cause of thy Ancient Lord, for the people of the Bayan, most of them have disbelieved in Him in Whom they had believed and have returned to the lowest of the low, save him whose hand was taken by the hand of grace and who was delivered from the wrongdoing people - they who wronged their own souls and the souls of the servants, and were not conscious thereof and were among the heedless ones.

I have created all things for the praise of My Self, though I have ever been sanctified above the mention of all the worlds.\" And I offered My Cause to all who are in the heavens and earth. Then all those who had even a mustard seed of love for Satan and his manifestations fell away. Thus did the sun of wisdom shine forth from the horizon of the holy and luminous Finger. Say: O people! Do you call upon Baal and forsake Him Who created all in the heavens and earth? Fear God and take not Satan as your protector. Those who wage war against God and dispute His signs and deny His sovereignty - these have no portion in the Book and were far removed from the seat of nearness. Your letter has come before Us, both before and after it another letter, wherein you called upon God, your Lord and the Lord of the mighty Throne. Blessed are you for having partaken of the virgin fruits of the gardens of knowledge - this is from the grace of your Lord, the Most Merciful, that you might thank Him with a pure and radiant heart. By Him Who is unique in glory and splendor, and singular in grandeur and majesty - one letter of what God has cast upon your heart in your tablets is better for you than all you have done in His path, and My Self suffices as witness to what I say. Beware lest you cloud your heart with the mention of anything - rather remember your Lord and fear no one, for He will guard you from every wicked oppressor. Ascend to Him at all times and be not dismayed by what has befallen you. Rather reflect on My tribulation and affliction and exile and imprisonment and trials, lest the harm of those who disbelieved and associated partners with God and were deprived of the breezes of the Spirit affect you. We have sent by the hands of Salman Tablets wherein one letter thereof equals not what has been created in the kingdom of origination. Look upon them that your heart may rejoice and your eyes be consoled and you may witness yourself upon a manifest spirit. Although in such days nothing should descend from the direction of the Throne except that which would burn the hearts of every insightful believer, yet since My mercy has preceded, We have therefore varied the verses away from expressions of sorrow, as a favor from Us to those who have taken for themselves a true path to God. Know then that We have permitted you to dispose of whatever worldly ornaments come to you as you wish, and We have made you in the Mother Book a trustworthy one in truth.

Do ye imagine that anything can be hidden from His knowledge? Nay, by His very Self, were ye but to know! Do ye feel shame before His servants yet feel no shame before Him Who created you by His command? There is no God but He, the Creator, the Fashioner, the Former, the Ordainer, the Mighty, the Great. Say: O people! Purify your hearts from all else but Him, then turn your faces toward this Countenance which hath dawned from the horizon of eternity with manifest splendor. Aid thy Lord through counsel and utterance - this is what God hath prescribed for every soul at the outset of this Most Great, this wondrous Revelation. Say: O people! Shed not blood, for this hath been forbidden in the Book of God, were ye but to know. Victory hath been ordained through the mention of proofs and exposition - thus hath the command been sent down and the decree established from the presence of the Mighty, the Powerful. Whoso quickeneth a soul with the spirit of faith, it is as though he had quickened all mankind - thus was it revealed in the Bayan, then in the Qur'an, the Psalms and the Gospel. Say: O people! Seize ye the measure of these days and be not of the heedless. How many of those near to God waited yet attained not, how many of the sincere sacrificed their lives yet were not honored, while ye have attained to this most great bounty without toil or labor. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of this wondrous Remembrance. Should ye remember God but once in His days, it would be better for you than the kingdom of the heavens and earth - this is a certain truth. Compare not these days with days past or future - thus hath the Revealer of the Bayan clearly stated, were ye but of those who perceive. Leave what ye possess and take what hath been sent down to you from the heaven of might and power by God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Choosing. Be not of those who remained in doubt and discord at this radiant dawn. Behold this Revelation and what appeareth from it with His eye, that ye may be illumined by the light of His countenance and that Our heedless servants may be enlightened through you. Thus have We sent down the verses unto thee and dispatched them to thee that thou mayest find the fragrance of the garment therefrom and be of the thankful.

The clouds of oppression were raised up, and the sword of tyranny was drawn from the sheath of pride, and there came to pass that which caused the Concourse on High, the denizens of the Kingdom of Names, and the dwellers of Paradise to wail and lament. By God's life! There remained nothing that did not weep, yet be thou gladdened through God's grace, for in truth they attained to a bounty the like of which hath never appeared in creation, and they themselves had, with the utmost lowliness and supplication, besought this most exalted station from God. After their return from Iraq they were manifest with the utmost glory and elevation through divine grace, and at the end of their lives they attained to that which their souls had loved. God hath sent down concerning their tragedy that which caused eyes to weep and hearts to melt. The Supreme Pen hath made mention of them in such wise that all those who are nigh unto God and His Messengers seek this station and have besought and continue to beseech it from God.

Leave behind all created things and hasten with your hearts unto God, the Revealer of verses. This is what you were promised in the Tablets from One All-Knowing, All-Informed. Arise to aid the Cause of your Lord - this is better for you, if you be of those who understand.

Hold fast to the cord of your Lord's tender mercy, then rest assured in His grace. Say: O my God! Aid me to be steadfast in Thy love and in following Thy command, then ordain for me what befits Thy station and Thy gifts. Thou art indeed the Almighty over what Thou willest, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Merciful. If you find one who makes mention of your Lord, convey to him greetings from this exiled Prisoner. Say: He has desired for no one save what God has desired for him - to this testifies every fair-minded, discerning one. Throughout His days He was beneath the swords of His enemies, yet from the horizon of prison He calls you unto God, the Lord of Names. Beware lest you deprive yourselves of that for which you were created. Draw near with your hearts unto the Beloved and be not of those who hesitate.

Through Him was revealed that which was concealed, and the Ancient Beauty shone forth amidst the peoples, yet the people remain in a mighty veil. This is the horizon from which the suns of names have dawned, and the springtime whereby the gardens in the hearts of the mystics have been adorned. This is the dayspring of guidance among creation and the lamp of oneness for those in the heavens and the earth. At His call all things cried out, and at His grief the Concourse on High lamented and the Faithful Spirit cried aloud. This is verily the Book wherein there is no doubt, and the light of God for whoso turneth unto Him, and a burning meteor against the devils. This is the proof of God unto all who are in the realm of possibility, and His enduring testimony unto those in all the worlds. Through Him the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafted throughout creation, and the atoms cried out: \"Power belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most High, the Omnipotent!\" Through Him were the veils rent asunder and that which was inscribed on a preserved tablet was made manifest. Were We to expound the verses of this Revelation, the seas would be exhausted, by My steadfast and ancient resolve. They who are heedless this day shall find themselves in manifest loss. Blessed is the lion who hath emerged from the thicket of divine power to aid his Lord, the Mighty, the Generous.

Hearken unto what the Dove of Holiness sang upon the Tree, that there is no God but Him and that 'Ali before Muhammad is the Sovereign of existence in both the unseen and visible realms. All were created by His command and all act by His command. Say: O people! Fear God and do not distort the words of God or change them according to your imaginings. Be not of those who are not guided by the lights of God and who differ in the religion of God. Then show mercy to one another, O people, and let none boast over another in anything. All this is the decree of God, ordained in truth in the preserved tablets of glory. And you, strive in the paths of your Lord, then aid the Cause of your Master with all your power. This is My command to you and to those who hasten unto God. Say: O people! Forget not God's covenant, transgress not God's bounds, and go not beyond what you have been commanded in the hidden and holy Book which was sent down to 'Ali in truth on the day when the souls of all creation were troubled, and the hearts of every known mystic. Then know that We have arrived in the prison behind lofty mountains, and the matter has become severe upon Us from all directions. Yet We remain thankful for this, in praiseworthy gratitude. We thank God for what He has decreed for Us of His firm and ordained destiny. By God, whatever appears from the Beloved, He indeed is the One Who is loved. Thus have We sent down the verses unto you and related to you what has befallen Us, that you may be of those who rejoice in the traces of God. The Spirit, the Glory and the Splendor be upon you and upon every patient and grateful one.\n\n=== END BH02463 ===\n\n=== START BH02464 ===\n\nHe is the Speaker, the Hearer, the All-Knowing, the Answerer\n\nGod testifieth that there is none other God but Him, and He Who hath come with the truth is the Dawning-Place of My Revelation, the Dayspring of My inspiration, the Manifestation of My Self, and the Source of My mighty and irrevocable Command.

Throughout ages and centuries, they were occupied with the mention of God, glorified be His majesty, and were adorned with the ornament of His blessed name in supreme glory, speaking the word of unity in gatherings and assemblies, sorrowful and grief-stricken from the long absence. Yet when the morn of manifestation dawned and the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of the world, all engaged in cursing and execration. Would that they had sufficed with this much! But finally they issued the decree for the death of the Lord of the world. In any case, the delusions of the past became the cause and reason for this most great error. Now again the people of the Bayan are walking those same steps. Say: O heedless ones! Reflect upon the fruits of the previous party, that perchance ye may become aware and roll up the carpet of suspicions and imaginings in the name of the Lord of all names. In words they called themselves the most exalted in the world, but on the day of the test they were seen as more debased than all peoples. We beseech God to aid you to stand firm with supreme steadfastness. Speak for God's sake and summon unto God, that perchance the temple of the world may be cleansed from the dust of suspicions and imaginings and be adorned with the ornament of certitude and assurance. Convey Our greetings to the friends in that land and remind them of the mention of the Most Exalted Pen, that perchance the path of falsehood may not be opened again, that all may find the source and goal, and fix their gaze upon God alone. This is the binding command that hath appeared. It is hoped that the people of that land may perceive the fragrance of these days and return, detached from all else. Say:\n\nMy God, my God!

Leave the idols and what ye have heard from them. They are indeed a people of deniers.

Blessed art thou for having believed in Him and in that which hath been sent down from the heaven of His grace, and for having acknowledged that which the Nightingale of Proof warbled upon the highest branches.\n\nThe gate of heaven hath been opened and the Lord of the Kingdom of Names hath come with a sovereignty that the hosts could not repel, with a might that the power of kings could not weaken, and with a command before which all in the heavens and on earth have bowed down. He stood before the faces of the world and summoned all unto the All-Knowing, the One Informed. He chose not silence for Himself nor did He conceal His face for less than a moment. He appeared and manifested that which He desired, despite the company of divines who broke God's Covenant and Testament and turned away from His straight path.\n\nWhen thou hearest the call of My Name, the Self-Subsisting, and attainest unto My choice-sealed wine, turn thy face toward God, the Lord of what was and what shall be, and say:\n\nMy God, my God!

Quicken the dead through the name of the Beloved of all possibility, and guide those who remain behind to the Kawthar of guidance.\n\nThis is the Day for the manifestation of supreme steadfastness.

He said: \"We beseech God to forgive him and remit his sins and ordain for him what will benefit him.\" Ten majidis were allocated to be given, and afterwards, for as long as they are occupied with treatment, one quarter majidi should be given daily to his family, and from the time this letter arrives, give them for one full month.\n\nAnd regarding what you had written about some old belongings of the departed Aqa Muhammad Hadi being given to Mulla Muhammad Ali, and one majidi being given as payment - the command is that Mulla Muhammad Ali should deliver that one majidi to the heirs of the departed one, and in exchange one majidi will be given here to the aforementioned gentleman.\n\nFurthermore, the skullcap and letter addressed to Haji Siyyid Javad, upon him be the glory of God, arrived. And regarding what you had written about the tea that was sent causing embarrassment to that beloved one - that honor should never have any thought about such matters that might cause the slightest sadness to the heart, for it has been and is very clear that that honor exercises the utmost care and consideration in all related matters, and desires that whatever is most exalted and glorious of everything should be present, and none who looks with the eye of justice can deny this. This evanescent one's submission was entirely about the tea itself, that it is of this kind.\n\nAnd regarding what you had written about relief from outward impurity, it was presented.

The fundamental relationship has been and will continue to be the spiritual bond of faith. When this relationship is established and any soul attains to it, that soul is mentioned eternally before the Throne, even if not outwardly mentioned, and is counted among the names recorded in God's Tablet, though none may be aware of it. Observe that if this relationship is not established, the outward relationship is not considered and is not mentioned before the Throne. Thus many who had outward relationships failed to attain to faith at the time of the appearance of the Dawning Places of the divine Command, and were therefore not counted among those related. Praise be to the Ancient Lord that you have attained to this station and turned toward His direction. God willing, you must remain so firmly established on the path that all who are on earth will be unable to prevent you and will find themselves powerless. This is among the most excellent of deeds.\n\nYour letter has come before Us and We have heard that which you called upon God, your Lord, and We have accepted your mention, O you who are mentioned among the worlds. Rejoice in the favors of your Lord, for He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Grieve not for the leaf who has winged her flight to the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree. She has attained to what was ordained for her in the Book of your Lord, the Most High, the Most Great. We mentioned her before, and her name is recorded in the Tablets of your Lord.

Any soul who speaks today other than what the Sovereign of Manifestation has outwardly spoken - that is pure delusion and sheer calumny, and avoidance of it is necessary and obligatory. Be ever anticipating God's grace and detached from all else. The handmaidens who have ascended to the Most Glorious Horizon dwell beneath the shade of the Tree of Grace, partaking of the wine of bounty. Blessed are they in having attained the Dawning-Place of the Cause and in soaring in the atmosphere of the love of God, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Be joyous at all times through God's grace and celebrate His remembrance. His confirmations have been and will continue to be the helper of those who have turned to Him, both men and women.

I desire their salvation, while they dig a pit for My destruction. Thus have the servants who call upon Me day and night become veiled. Say: O people, open your eyes!

Ask God, thy Lord, at all times to strengthen thee in that whereunto thou hast attained and to make thee one who can break the might of the aggressors who have denied God, Who causeth the night and day to succeed each other. Associate with those whom thou findest to be weak. We love not that the reward of those who have turned to the Countenance should be lost. Thus hath the matter been decreed by thy Lord, the Mighty, the Compelling. Make mention of My servants and raise them to the kingdom of My loving-kindness that they may behold My signs and the manifestations of My grandeur. Thus hath the tongue of revelation spoken at a time when it was surrounded by the hosts of the wicked.

Within them lie the treasures of the waters of My knowledge which, when their veils are removed, flow forth in the name of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One. Be wise in all matters. Those who exceed the bounds of wisdom are overcome by heedlessness. Thus hath the command been sent down in the Tablets from the Pen of thy Lord, and none understand it save those possessed of insight.

Say: O people! Tarry not upon the Bridge; hearken unto the words of your Lord, the All-Merciful, then pass over it as a passing cloud. Beware lest ye differ concerning Him Who was the solace of 'Ali's eyes in the Ridvan of the Bayan, then of Muhammad's eyes in the Garden of the Furqan, then of the Spirit's eyes in the heaven of destiny, then of God's eyes, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Forgiving. Say: O people! He hath come unto you even as 'Ali came with the truth. Fear ye God and follow not every doubtful idolater. Say: O people! Be ye united in the Cause of God - this is better for you - then turn unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, with humility and contrition. Thus do We counsel thee out of Our love for thee, that thou mayest be mindful within thyself and that they who are endued with understanding may be guided thereby. Say: Were the veil to be lifted from the face of the Youth, the tongues of all created things would proclaim: \"By God! This is a wondrous king!\" Say: Do ye deny Him through Whom the Messengers were sent forth aforetime and through Whom the Lord of lords hath come? Whoso denieth this Revelation hath denied God in His previous Manifestations, as attesteth that which hath been sent down in the Book. Await ye the Day which ye were promised in the Tablets, when the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall upon the face of the earth. Say: The Day hath come, and none knoweth it save God, unto Whom returneth the decree of the beginning and the end. Say: Verily the Day hath appeared in the temple of the Youth. Blessed be He Who hath sent Him forth with the truth and dispatched Him unto His servants. He, verily, is great in bounty and severe in punishment. O people! Stand firm in the Cause of God and in the praise of His Self, and when ye behold Satan seeking to ascend unto the heaven of understanding that he may discover what is in your hearts of the love of the All-Merciful, drive him away with the shooting stars. Say: Seize ye the measure of these days. By God! The eye of creation hath not seen their like. Soon that which hath been decreed in the Tablets shall come to pass and the Face shall be concealed. Then shall ye bite your fingers in remorse. Beware lest ye be heedless of that which hath appeared with truth and follow every deceptive liar. And thou, render thanks unto thy Lord for having attained unto this Cause wherein the feet of most men have slipped, some seeking to slay Him, others rising up to plot against His Cause. But the scheming of the idolaters hath ended in ruin.

And if His name be mentioned as \"Baha,\" this was mentioned by the tongue of the Beloved aforetime, and by all names, were ye of them that know. Yet doth every thing bear witness to the sanctification of His Essence from names and their kingdom, and the glorification of His Self from attributes and their dominion. Thereupon doth the Tongue of Grandeur speak above His head, saying: \"By God! This is My Beloved - I love not that any should know Him save Me or that any eye should behold Him save Mine own.\" And beyond this He speaketh words which I am powerless to mention, and were I to mention them all created things would be thunderstruck. For after they were promised this Revelation throughout all the Bayan, they clung to a name among names which stood before Us as a servant standing before his master. When he turned away, most of the people turned away through what Satan whispered in their breasts. Thus were they deprived of this Beauty whereby the eye of God, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, was solaced, even after We had informed them that every possessor of light would be darkened at His manifestation and every possessor of radiance would be altered at the dawning of the lights of His countenance, the Dawning, the Luminous.\n\nSay: O people!

We have heard of thy drawing nigh unto God, and We prevented thee from attaining His presence because of that which the hands of those who rode the steeds of passion have wrought, and who committed that which caused the dwellers of the highest Paradise to lament.

Despair not of God's Spirit and mercy, and forget not when thou wert in the vicinity of thy Lord's mercy and the countenance of God, the Mighty, the Bountiful, was turned toward thee. Remember Him in thy days, and the tribulations which befell Him from those who perceived not the fragrance of faithfulness and followed vain imaginings. Thou art indeed aware of what befell Us in the Land of Mystery when two persons rose up against God, the Lord of Days. God seized one of them with His might, whereupon, seeing this, he said: \"I repent unto Thee, O Thou in Whose grasp is the dominion of all men!\" And the other presented himself and repented with hypocrisy, and thy Lord rent not asunder the veil until the appointed time arrived. When We reached the prison, he committed deeds whereby the honor of God was dishonored among His servants. By My life! We showed patience and concealed matters until the affair reached a point where the Cause was well-nigh transformed. Therefore We expelled him and his sister from the gate. O Jamal! I have sacrificed My soul and My spirit to exalt the Word and to glorify the Cause of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bountiful. Should We observe any of the Branches acting contrary to that which God desireth, We would assuredly cast him out with truth, for verily I am the Mighty, the Compelling.

Detach thyself from all else but God, then suffice thyself therewith. He is with thee under all conditions. Beware lest the cares and sorrows of the world take hold of thee. Behold, then remember what hath befallen Us from the hosts of the wicked ones. God will soon exalt thee through the truth and will aid thee through His grace. He, verily, fulfilleth His promise.

Forget thy sorrows, then weep for this Youth Whose blood hath been shed at every moment by those who were created by His Word. When they attained unto full strength they rose up against God in opposition, following their own selves and desires. Therefore do all the tribes in the realms of eternity lament My tribulations, and every servant whom God hath aided to recognize the Manifestation of His Self and whose eyes He hath opened doth weep. Be thou patient in all things except in My tribulations, then put thy trust in God Who created thee by a command from His presence. Cut thyself from all else but Him. Adorn thy heart with My love and thy tongue with My remembrance, and be not dismayed in the face of destiny. Be content with what God hath ordained for thee and follow the paths of His good-pleasure. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having aided thee to recognize His Self, while all others have opposed Him. Soon shall He requite them for what their hands have wrought, their tongues have uttered, and their hearts have harbored. With Him is the knowledge of all things and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and He knoweth the secret and public doings of every soul. Strive then with utmost endeavor to remain steadfast in thy Lord's Cause, firm in His love and established in His guidance, for in these days from every pit hath emerged a serpent of polytheism that rusheth forth behind every soul, and when it reacheth that soul it stingeth and destroyeth it instantly, except for one who possesseth the antidote of the name of thy Lord, the Most High. Nothing that thou witnesseth or beholdeth can affect such a one; rather, he affecteth all things and prevaileth over every soul through the triumph of his Lord, and everything witnesseth this in the shadow of Him Who created and nurtured it.

The honored Trustee, upon him be My glory and loving-kindness, hath made and continueth to make mention of the believing men and believing women, the devoted men and devoted women, and hath sought and continueth to seek bounty for all. Thus doth the Wronged One testify in this moment. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon you, O My handmaidens, and upon My handmaidens who have not broken God's Covenant and His Testament, and whom the clamor of the world hath not held back from the Most Great Name - they who have turned to the Most Sublime Horizon, the Station from which hath shone forth the Day-Star of this Great Announcement.\n\n=== END BH02496 ===\n\n=== START BH02497 ===\n\nHe is the Mighty! O thou who dwellest in the precincts of thy Lord's mercy! We have seen thy letter and read what was therein. Verily thy Lord is the All-Seeing Witness. As for what thou didst ask regarding him who turned away from God - verily We concealed thereby the source and origin of the matter, as a wisdom from Us, and He is the All-Wise. He is mentioned as the Mirror in the language of the people, and this is a name that applies to all things. Verily thy Lord hath ever been sanctified above this name and its like and what transcendeth it, as every person of illumined vision doth testify. Should anyone discover the interpretations of My Book and the allusions of My words, he would bear witness that from the beginning of the Cause I made mention of him according to his station and rank, but the people are in manifest ignorance. Today, should any soul reflect even slightly and be fair-minded, he will surely distinguish truth from falsehood and comprehend it. The light of the sun cannot be confused with darkness. The point is that he was mentioned by the name of Mirror, but those who have denied God and His verses in this Revelation utter words at every moment and speak according to their vain imaginings. The person of insight and knowledge speaketh not through imitation but rather through investigation which surrounds him. Before the Revelation, every soul was firm in his belief in the Point of the Bayan and ascended. He is reckoned with God as being immersed in the ocean of mercy. Whatever skilled physicians and surgeons do regarding a patient is valid and executable, but they must be adorned with the ornament of justice. If they know the truth, this is assuredly preferable and more beloved.\n\nQuestion: If one of the followers of the Calf, meaning one of the friends of him who turned away from God, should utter unseemly words about the Branches, and it be possible to bring him to justice in such a way that no harm would come to the Divine Cause - is this permitted or not?\n\nAnswer: This is absolutely not permitted. In all scriptures, books and tablets this reprehensible act, which is killing, has been strictly forbidden in the Book. Blessed is he who heareth! Woe to the heedless! Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!\n\nAs for the final matter mentioned regarding the betrayal by one whom you had trusted with your family - this matter and its ruling depend on its manifestation in the visible world. O thou who hast turned to God! Today the bird of justice is caught in the talons of oppression. The dark clouds have prevented its light from shining. If the people of the world become ready and capable of receiving this most great bounty and supreme gift, in that very moment the lights of the Sun of Justice will shine forth from behind the veil of clouds, and the darkness of oppression by treacherous souls will return to nothingness, like a shadow when the sun shines forth. The glory be upon thee.\n\n=== END BH02497 ===\n\n=== START BH02498 ===\n\nHere is your beloved, Habibullah of Khunsar. Upon him be the Glory of God.

We have accepted thy turning to Us, thy devotion and thy visitation, and We counsel thee to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped and hearts have been troubled. Glory be upon thee and upon those who have attained unto the Kawthar of inner meanings from the hand of the bounty of their Lord, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nBeware, beware lest thou commit what thou wrote at the end of thy letter. These are the deeds of the ignorant and the acts of the heedless. I swear by the Most Great Name that if any of the friends should harm another soul, it is as though he hath harmed the Truth Itself. Conflict, contention, corruption, murder and the like have been strictly forbidden in God's Book. Turn unto God in repentance for what thou didst intend in thy soul, then return unto Him and say: \"O my God! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Word to ordain for me the word of forgiveness, for I intended in my soul what Thou didst not desire and what Thou forbade in Thy Book. I beseech Thee to remit my evil deeds and to immerse me in the ocean of Thy forgiveness. Thou art verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\"\n\nEvery injustice manifested by an oppressor - leave it to the Truth Itself. The hand of divine justice is all-encompassing and all-pervading. There hath been and is no need for corruption, conflict, contention, murder and pillage. The triumph of the Cause hath been and ever shall be through utterance, and all else stems from selfish desires. God protect us and you, O ye who have turned towards Him.\n\nAll the souls mentioned in thy letter which thou didst send to this servant who is present have attained unto divine bounty and are remembered before the Throne. Give them the glad-tidings from Me of this mighty station, and convey My greetings unto them and unto those who have held fast unto that which they were commanded by One All-Knowing, All-Informed.\n\nThou didst mention the son of his honor of Abhar.

Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark which God described in the Qayyumu'l-Asma', a command from His presence, and He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing.\n\nWe beseech God that He may assist thee to serve His Cause and enable thee to achieve that which will exalt His Word amongst His servants. In the nights and days We are occupied with the remembrance of the Goal of all the worlds, and when the effulgences of the lights of manifestation and the call of Him Who spoke on Sinai were raised from the Sinai of knowledge, all the divines of Persia arose in rejection and denial, and unwittingly pronounced judgment against the very Manifestation Himself, whereat all things raised their lamentations. By the lights of the Sun of Truth! They perpetrated such an injustice as hath never appeared in the world, and committed that which causeth the denizens of the Most Exalted Paradise and the Supreme Heaven to weep and wail, while the perpetrators remain heedless and veiled. We beseech God to assist thee that thou mayest arise to help His Cause with wisdom, love and kindliness.

Yet when the expanse of the world was illumined by the lights of the Most Great Luminary, all arose in opposition. The primary cause and reason for this opposition were the divines of the age. Whenever the ocean of knowledge appeared, the sun of bounty was manifest, and the heaven of Revelation was raised up, all became as veils and prevented the servants from the Lord of Creation - though all were brought from nothingness into being for the recognition of this Day. Blessed art thou for having shattered the idols of vain imaginings and turned toward the Dawning-Place of certitude. What befell thee hath repeatedly befallen Us. Give thanks unto thy Lord as We gave thanks for what befell Us in His Straight Path and His Great Announcement. Thou hast ever been mentioned in the Most Holy Court and still art. We beseech God to assist thee to be patient. Verily He is the All-Patient and hath commanded all to patience, and He is the Ancient Commander. Soon shall the people of tyranny and rebellion confess their own loss and your gain. Were they to become aware even to the extent of a needle's eye, all would cry out \"I turn unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world!\" When thou receivest My letter and findest from it the sweet fragrances of My loving-kindness, say: \"My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having made me know Thee when Thy servants were heedless of Thee, and for having caused me to turn toward Thee when most of Thy creatures turned away. I beseech Thee, O Lord of existence, by the ocean of Thy bounty and the heaven of Thy generosity, to strengthen me to remain steadfast in Thy Cause and in Thy love in such wise that the tyranny of the Pharaohs among Thy servants and the oppression of the tyrants among Thy creatures shall not prevent me.

However, since what occurred was in the path of God, patience and forbearance are most beloved and fitting.

The world itself proclaims its own evanescence. Every person of insight witnesses its passing at every moment, and every hearing ear hearkens to its lamentation and wailing. The station that has flowed from the Most Exalted Pen for the Afnan has been and remains mention, praise and teaching the Cause to the extent possible. No station has been or is more exalted than this station. In the Tablets has been revealed that which the world cannot equal even one word thereof. By the life of God! The Wronged One loves you and consoles you in what has befallen you. We beseech God to preserve you, to aid you and to enable you to exercise gracious patience and noble forbearance. The Afnan, upon him be My glory and care, is present and abiding at rest in the shelter of divine mercy and the pavilions of divine grandeur. Give thanks to your Lord for this manifest grace.

Most times, both day and night, thou hast been and art remembered. Nevertheless, signs of vexation and sorrow are manifest from thee. Reflect and speak with fairness. By My life! Then thou wilt say: \"I repent, O my God, for what I wrote. I testify that Thou art my Companion and Friend, my Purpose and my Beloved. Thou hast not severed from me the cord of Thy loving-kindness, nor withheld from me the wonders of Thy grace.

I beseech God to grant them that which will solace their eyes, bring peace to their hearts, and make firm their feet in such wise that the clamor of every oppressor and the croaking of every lying pretender will not cause them to slip. The Glory be upon you and upon all who have believed in God, our Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bountiful.\n\n28 Ramadan 1296\n\n=== END BH02507 ===\n\n=== START BH02508 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station, the Most Great, the Most Glorious\n\nPraise be to God Who is one in His Essence with His Essence, Who is sanctified in His Self by His Self, Who is holy in His Being for His Being, and Who testifieth that there is none other God but Him. Eyes apprehend Him not, but He apprehendeth all eyes, and He is the All-Subtle, the All-Informed.\n\nThis servant hath received your honored letter and perceived from it the fragrance of the garment of love in this Dawn wherein the Lord of all beings speaketh and calleth all to the path of guidance. He is, verily, the Ruler in the beginning and in the return. Concerning what you mentioned about the city - that its essence was taken and its accidents were left, the former in the highest horizon and the latter in the blazing fire - verily those who turned away, fabricated lies and committed oppression shall reap what they have sown, even as their forefathers reaped, a promise from God, the One, the Single, the All-Wise, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We beseech God to assist His loved ones there, for they are brilliant, radiant stars when darkness hath encompassed most of creation. They have their work and others have theirs - the former endureth while the latter perisheth. Blessed is he whom the transient preventeth not from the countenance of the Eternal. We hope that you will convey greetings from this servant to all of them. As for what they mentioned in the news to your honor, remind them of the Tablet of Ra'is, the Most Holy Book, the Tablet of Fu'ad and other Tablets, that what they asked about may become clear to them. He is, verily, the True Informer, the All-Knowing.\n\nRegarding what you wrote about abstention and determining the day of Ridvan: The previous day, which was Wednesday the 7th of Rabi'u'l-Avval, was the Festival, and thirty-two days after the Festival is the first of Ridvan. For example, Wednesday 7th Rabi'u'l-Avval is the Festival of fasting, and Saturday 9th Rabi'u'th-Thani in the afternoon is the first of Ridvan. It is reiterated that the beginning of abstention corresponds to the day that your honor wrote about, and the previous day which was Wednesday was the Festival, and thirty-two days after the Festival, which is the first day of the month of Baha - the first of the thirty-two - the thirty-second day in the afternoon is the first of the Festival of Ridvan. I long and hope to attain your presence at that time. The sun of permission hath also shone forth that, should they deem it advisable, they may proceed with their families to the Most Holy Court. The choice resteth with your honor. Upon you be all His most glorious glory.\n\nThe Servant\n\nThursday, 8 Rabi'u'l-Avval 1294\n\n\\[In this blessed Tablet the scribe has used the letter 'ayn instead of the word 'Festival'\\]\n\n=== END BH02508 ===\n\n=== START BH02509 ===\n\nO Title of God, the Luminous, upon him be the Glory of God! He is the Most Sorrowful, the Most Sorrowful\n\nPraise be to God Who hath torn away from the face of one of the Names the veils of glory, whereupon all who are in earth and heaven were struck with terror, and the servants were immersed in the depths of self and passion. We delivered them once again and raised them up through Our mercy that precedeth all things, and We cast upon them His most exalted Word through the tongue of the Most Great Appearance in My Most Glorious Name. They dispersed from around the Throne time and again, except those whom We preserved through My Most Exalted Sovereignty and purified from the evil suggestions of the people of denial - they who took the Calf as their lord instead of God, the Lord of the last and the first. Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen inscribed this as a reminder for whoever feareth.\n\nO Beloved! The Pen of the Spirit cannot move across the Tablet due to the severity of tribulations. Consider then the state of Him Whom God hath sent unto mankind in days when the most truthful among them is the most lying, the most knowledgeable is the most ignorant, the most exalted is the most wicked, the most intelligent is the most foolish, the most honored is the most despised, the most upright is the most crooked, the most generous is the most miserly, the most lowly is their proof, and the most elevated. God hath decreed for Me what He hath not decreed for anyone in creation, such that with My own hands I clothed one of the wretched ones with the garment of Names and the essence of tyranny with the robe of justice, and commanded Me to strip it and remove it from his temple. When I desired to do as commanded, all in the heavens and earth were struck with terror, save those whom God had sanctified from the doubts of the idolaters. Glorified then be God, the Powerful Commander and the Mighty, Omnipotent Sovereign!\n\nSay: O people! Did We consult with you about clothing him that We should consult with you about removing it? Verily, He Who raised him up through grace cast him down through justice, and He is the Ruler over whatsoever He willeth. By God! The Primal Point was innocent of him and his like. When We were known among the servants, We manifested the Cause and mentioned him by a name other than Mine. Whoever possesseth insight and understanding will recognize and comprehend and be among those who know.\n\nThe Tablets were sent - deliver them. And afterward the mentioned Tablets will also be sent, God willing. Convey greetings from God to all the loved ones of God.

In the name of the All-Knowing Expositor. Today all must speak for the sake of God and gaze toward God. Let them not deprive their eyes from the supreme horizon, nor prevent their ears from hearkening to the words of the Lord of Names, nor withhold their hearts from turning to Him, nor veil their minds from contemplating His mighty signs and manifest conditions. If thou wouldst reflect upon what hath come to pass, thou wouldst observe all the world and its peoples as non-existent, and wouldst hold fast to the firm cord of the Purpose of all worlds in such wise that none would have power to prevent thee. Whatsoever hath been other than God and mentioned without His leave is all vain and reckoned before the All-Merciful as satanic whisperings. We seek justice: after the appearance of the Most Great Sea and the dawning of the Ancient Luminary and the raising up of the divine heavens of His Cause and the manifestation of the paradise of His all-merciful utterance, is it befitting that one should turn away from all this and cling to the vain imaginings of a soul who cannot distinguish right from left, and deprive himself of the bounty of this Day which shineth forth outwardly and inwardly from the horizon of the heaven of His Cause? Nay, by His own Self! This was not and is not befitting. Leave aside all else and hold fast to His firm cord and turn unto His straight path. He is the One through Whose manifestation all things have proclaimed that there is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The fragrances of the merciful robe are wafting at all times, and the lights of the Sun of divine commandments are visible from the horizon of heaven. It behooveth thee and thy like to abandon all the doubts and idle fancies that exist in the world and to turn unto the Dawning-Place of the revelation of thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Take thou the chalice of divine knowledge from the hands of thy Lord's favors, then drink therefrom, detached from all the worlds. Verily, while thou art in thy home He remembereth thee in the Most Great Prison. Be thou thankful unto God for this manifest favor. Doth it beseem anyone to deny this certainty and turn unto every doubting impostor? By My life! If thou wouldst taste the sweetness of His utterance and recognize His love for thee, thou wouldst abandon all creation, turning unto the Single One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. And among His gifts and favors is that He remembereth thee through His grace while imprisoned among His enemies. This indeed is a bounty that hath illumined the horizon of generosity. Reflect, that thou mayest find what hath been revealed for thee in this perspicuous Tablet. We beseech God to assist thee in His remembrance and His Cause, and to make thee detached from every croaking, braying, deceitful remote one. Praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH02510 ===\n\n=== START BH02511 ===\n\nHe is the All-Seeing in the Most Glorious Horizon! O Abu-Basir! Arise and warn those who have denied the verses of the All-Merciful and have deprived themselves of this Paradise. Know thou that We have given the warning in this Tablet for a wisdom that was hidden from the eyes of the servants. Soon We shall reveal it unto thee through Our grace, for verily He encompasseth all the worlds. Then give glad tidings from Us to the people who have believed in this Cause, which was inscribed by the Finger of God in the Mother Book. Then remind them of what the Spirit hath cast into thy heart, and fear thou no one. Put thy trust in God and remain not concealed behind the veil of silence. Rend asunder the veils through the sovereignty of Our Name, the Powerful, the Bestower, and be thou a herald among the servants of this Most Great Remembrance, which hath been witnessed from the holy horizon with the ornament of God. Be thou articulate in the praise of thy Lord and mindful of the wondrous expressions of His remembrance which have been recorded in the Tablet. Aid thy Lord with the sword of utterance - thus hath the matter been decreed from the Pen of the All-Merciful in these days wherein sorrows have encompassed Me from all directions, and God is witness unto this. Know thou that in those days God hath ordained the victory of His Cause through exposition rather than through the tongue, and thus hath the sun of wisdom shone forth from the horizon of justice with a radiance that encompasseth all the worlds. Hearken unto what God hath revealed unto thee from the Fire that hath been kindled in thy heart by the Self-Subsisting, the Self-Existing - that there is no God but I. I have created all things for My Cause and brought all beings into existence for the knowledge of My Self, that We might bring them to a station of glorious dignity. Verily, this Youth is the sanctuary of holiness among the servants, the Kaaba of the Cause in all lands, the dwelling place of eternity for those in the kingdom of the divine cloud, and the beacon of knowledge for all in the realm. So sacrifice thy self, thy spirit and thy body for the Cause of thy Lord. Then remind the people at all times with wisdom and utterance, and be not still within thyself - this is better for thee than all that existeth upon the earth. Thus have We commanded thee and taught thee, that thou mightest arise to serve the Cause with a sovereignty that encompasseth all the worlds. If thou findest one who is receptive, impart unto him what the Spirit hath imparted unto thee, and if thou findest one who turneth away, be not grieved but turn away from him and remain in an impregnable protection. And the glory be upon thee and upon those who have believed in God and who stand firm today upon the path of truth.\n\n=== END BH02511 ===\n\n=== START BH02512 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise!

He hath ordained for thee a station of glory with thy Lord - preserve it, lest the whispers of the wayward keep thee from it. Verily, thy Lord hath heard thy call and hath ordained for thee in the Tablet of Command whatsoever He willeth. Make His will thy wish. By God! This is better for thee than the dominion of the heavens and earth. Let thy will be dissolved in His Will and grieve not over what hath befallen thee. God will soon transform hardship into ease and decree for thee what He pleaseth. Verily, He hath power over all things. Despair not of God's Spirit and mercy, but rejoice in His remembrance of thee and remember Him in all conditions. He is with them that remember Him. Be not dismayed in the days of God. Rather, rejoice in that He hath aided thee to recognize His Self. Be steadfast and find solace in the praise of His Self, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Remember: \"Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy power whereby Thou didst subjugate the winds and send down the verses and cause the sun of Thy beauty to shine from the horizon of Thy will - whereby the faces of Thy chosen ones were illumined by its radiance - to send down upon me from the heaven of Thy bounty a mercy from Thee and from the cloud of Thy mercy a blessing from Thy presence. Then set right, O my God, all my affairs, for Thou art the Lord of grandeur and majesty. Ordain for me the good of this world and the next, for Thou hast power to do what Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nConvey My greetings to Nasr and mention that though some people are under the delusion - you who have seen Yahya and know full well that he was never worthy to speak in the presence of the Face - observe now the same condition. That We mentioned his name was so that the hosts of the oppressors would remain veiled from the Seat of the Cause, lest harm touch him before the Command of thy Lord was delivered. It is incumbent upon you to rend asunder the veils of the people, for most are unaware, even the brothers. We beseech God to aid thee in His Cause and make thee steadfast in His love and bring thee to the station ordained for thee - this truly is a mighty favor. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.

Blessed art thou for having migrated unto God and detached thyself from thy home for the love of God, the King, the Mighty, the Loving. By the True One! They who turned toward the throne after My arrival in the Most Great Prison - the Concourse on High pray for them and perceive from them the sweet fragrances of the mercy of their Lord, the All-Merciful. This is most excellent with God, the Mighty, the Praised. And they whose letters reached the throne after the Ancient Beauty entered the Supreme Prison - this is nearer to piety, did ye but know. For in the turning of the servants to the court of the Lord of creation there ariseth a tumult that causeth hearts to tremble. God hath ordained for those who desired the Face and whose letters reached the throne the reward of one who attained His presence and circled round the pavilion of His glory. Thus hath the bounty of your Lord encompassed all, would ye but understand. Let not the hardships of the world sadden thee in the path of thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. By God! We would not exchange an atom thereof for the treasuries of the worlds. When the Face of the Ancient One turned crimson from the breezes of revelation and His tongue spoke between the heavens and earth: \"I am He Who hath accepted for Himself the harm of the worlds, and the hardships of the world in their entirety dismay Me not, nor the might of the idolaters.\" Be as thy Lord was. Thus doth the Pen of the Ancient One counsel thee from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. We have ordained for thee in the Tablet that which the hearts of the mystics cannot comprehend, save those who have drunk the cup of eternity from the hand of Baha. Thus was the command, but the people are in evident remoteness. And praise be to God, the Beloved of the mystics.\n\nHe is God, exalted be His station. Glory and majesty belong to Him!\n\nO migrant unto God! Pass beyond all else but Him and be content with the love of God, which is the source of wealth. Though this station be hidden today, due to the lack of capacity of the peoples of the world, ere long in the kingdom of the All-Merciful the greatness and majesty of the lovers of Truth and their wealth and exaltation shall be made manifest. Blessed are they who strive to the extent possible to improve your outward affairs and who secretly spend what God hath given them with the utmost humility and submissiveness, that thereby your worldly affairs may be set right. Never before hath such a word flowed from the Pen of the Ancient One, and this is naught but His grace toward His honored servants. And glory be upon thee and upon them and upon those who counsel one another to good deeds and righteous acts.

If thou remainest steadfast on this Most Great Path and conveyest the Cause of thy Lord, this Most Ancient, Most Sublime Beauty, with all that thou possessest, thou shalt be among those who have the power. The Point shall be generated from thee, then all the letters and words, then the realities of the sanctified ones. By the True God! If thine eyes were to be opened and thine ears unstopped, and the face of thy heart were to turn toward this Gentle, Luminous Beauty, thou wouldst witness that at this moment there hath been generated from thee a temple facing the Throne, in the form of a fresh, verdant, delicate leaf, which calleth out concerning its Lord at every moment even as the Voice called out from the Tree on Sinai upon a wondrous and lofty Mount, and which speaketh at every moment with its Lord and receiveth from the mysteries of God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nBeware, beware, O Letter of God, lest thou burn it with the fire of turning away, for in these days all the layers of hell have appeared and the fires of polytheism and the blaze of envy and hatred have been kindled, by which every yellowed leaf and withered tree shall be consumed. And if thou seest that the embers of this fire reach thee, take hold of the Ark of Baha, then sail upon the crimson sea in the heaven of the cloud, then soar by the name of thy Lord, the Powerful, the Manifest, the Most Glorious, and be among those who are made manifest by the sovereignty of the Command. Then know that those who were created by a name from thy Lord have indeed laid claim to sovereignty over the Essence and the King of Names and Attributes, Who hath returned once again in His white robe which the polytheists have made red with the blood of hatred, whereat the hearts of those near unto God have grieved. And if thou desirest to know some of the mysteries of the Cause, read the Tablet which hath appeared from the Beauty of the Throne and was named the Tablet of Baha, then the Surih which was named of Blood, then the Surih in which the Most Great Pilgrimage was mentioned, for in all of these are signs for those who ask and clear proofs for those who know. And the Spirit from the glory of God be upon thee and upon all who take hold of this Mighty, this Wondrous Ark in the garment of His Sublime Name.\n\nA Tablet was previously issued from God, thy Most Glorious, Most Exalted Lord, with honor and glory and was sent forth.

And may they strive and make earnest endeavor with the utmost diligence and effort to teach the Cause of their Lord, that perchance through the wafting of spiritual breezes from the dawning-place of the heart of that wondrous living Letter, all darkened hearts and decayed bones may attain unto a new life of being.

The Fire hath been kindled in the heights of the divine cloud, and by it all who are in the heavens and on earth have been set ablaze, and all are now burning. The pillars of the Throne have been destroyed and its bearers have fled, and now the Spirit of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all that is seen and unseen, and the Lord of what was and what shall be, doth bear it. Intoxication hath seized the dwellers of the heavens and earth, and all now lie dead before thy Lord. The denizens of Sinai have been struck unconscious upon the lofty Mount, and they of the divine cloud have been obliterated upon the exalted Sinai, and everything hath been shaken within itself save certain letters of love for My Name, the All-Compelling, the Self-Subsisting. Arise thou to the Cause, then detach thyself from all directions and turn not to the right or left. And if thou findest hesitation in thyself, then be patient, yea patient, until God shall bring thee His Command, the irrevocable, the compelling, the mighty, the beloved. The letters of negation have gathered to prevent the people from the shore of the Cause. Say: Woe unto you for what ye do this Day! Beware lest thou turn unto them or cast thy gaze upon what appeareth from them. Leave them in the dust, then soar in this atmosphere which God hath made sanctified from the gaze of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and who mock the signs of God. Thus have We commanded thee that thou mayest arise to that whereunto thou wert commanded, as a grace from Us unto thee and unto those who walk upon the path that hath appeared in truth from the presence of a Compelling, Self-Subsisting One. Beware lest thou forget what We informed thee before concerning certain letters of hell. Now they have gathered in Iraq and at this moment they plot. Soon the winds of associating partners with God shall spread from the quarter of their hearts to all regions. Therefore seek thou refuge in God lest harm befall thee from these who have disbelieved in God openly and turned away from the Ancient Beauty and were among the deniers in preserved tablets of glory. Arise with the arising of God to the Cause of thy Lord and turn not unto them nor unto aught else. Say: The Kingdom on that Day is God's, the Truth.

The matter hath been decided through other hands, for He is the Decider, the All-Wise. We beseech God that He may assist them and strengthen them, inasmuch as they have turned with pure detachment unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. We have commanded them to return unto thee. Thus hath the decree gone forth from thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Great.\n\nIn thy letter was mention of one who desired to be remembered before the Countenance, that he might arise to praise his Lord, the Glorious. Say: O Sasson! There hath come forth from Zion that which was hidden, and the Call hath been raised from every direction. Blessed is the ear that hath turned and heard, and woe unto the heedless. Stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord, detached from all that is on earth. This is better for thee, if thou be of them that know. He loveth him that loveth Him, and ordaineth for whomsoever He willeth that which He willeth. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise.\n\nPraise thy Lord for having enabled thee to turn unto Him, after all the heedless and the dubious had turned away. His letter hath come before Our presence, and We found from it the fragrance of his love for the Beloved of the worlds. That which he hath deduced concerning this Cause is the truth, about which there is no doubt. The land of Syria hath been given glad-tidings of God's righteousness. Verily, He hath appeared with the truth. Blessed are they that turn unto Him. The mount of God hath quivered from the breeze of reunion. It is named Carmel, and it proclaimeth: \"The Builder of the Temple hath come, and the Healer of all ills.\" Blessed are they that attain.\n\nThe enemies have surrounded Us in these days, yet in this state We remember him with that which shall eternally establish his remembrance. It behooveth him to be of the thankful ones. We counsel him to observe wisdom, lest there occur that which would disturb the hearts of the weak ones. O Muhammad! Convey My greetings unto Daniel, and upon him be glory. Blessed is he who hath attained the remembrance of the Lord on this Day which was promised unto men by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed.

This is the most exalted station, as can be observed in that certain souls, though they witnessed the effulgences of the divine Sun from the Dayspring of Light of Oneness, were nevertheless debarred, by some earthly cause, from the Lord of Names and Creator of earth and heaven. Consider that known handmaiden who, though it was clear and evident to her and others that spiritual perfection and outward beauty were found in the Truth, yet severed the divine connection and clung to the connection of the idolaters, letting slip from her grasp the hem of God and clutching the hem of the deniers. She turned away from the Diamond to cleave unto clay, distancing herself from the Dayspring of perfection and beauty to join with a monkey, content and pleased with his company. If all the kingdom of the world were offered to any person of insight to spend but one night with such as she in bed, he would surely refuse, yet she remained deprived of the Most Glorious Branch due to the ornaments of the world and its trappings, becoming intimate with the most hideous form in existence. Yes, the nightingale is intimate with the rose while worms dwell in mud and clay; the dung beetle will not turn to the most pure and fragrant station nor fix its gaze upon the Most Great Prospect, but rather seeks intimacy with its own kind. Such is the nature of the world and its adherents. But verily thy Lord lieth in wait. Assuredly He hath rendered and will render unto each soul its due. This hath occurred solely that all might be convinced that love of the world maketh the eye blind and the ear deaf, such that man cannot distinguish between the highest heaven and the lowest depths. All must at all times take refuge in God, that He might gather all beneath the shade of the Tree of His grace and deprive no one. Hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful from the Divine Lote-Tree which is raised up in the wilderness of piety, and be thou neither gladdened by the world's acceptance nor saddened by its rejection, neither by its elevation nor its abasement. By My life! All that is thereon shall perish, and there shall endure the face of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Be thou steadfast in the path of Truth and turn away from His enemies.

After hearkening to the blessed divine Word, it has turned to the Friend, detached from all else.\n\nSay: O friends of Truth! Consider these days a precious opportunity and loose not your hold on the hem of His grace and bounty. What existence is there that has not been seized by non-existence? What glory is there that has not been overtaken by abasement? All that is witnessed in the kingdom shall become non-existent and void. What endures is the deed performed by the loved ones of God purely for His sake. Therefore in these spiritual days the friends must not deprive themselves of the lights of the countenance of their Eternal One. The ocean of bounty is surging and the Bestower is the hand of the All-Merciful's favor. O friends! With the power of faith, turn and partake! This is in spite of those who read the Bayan yet deny Him Who revealed and sent it. Thus does your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, command you.\n\nConvey to all the loved ones in that land a most glorious greeting from this Wronged One. Say: Praise the Beloved of the worlds that He caused to flow from the Pen of His Command that which shall endure as long as the kingdom and the heavenly kingdom endure. Thus does God mention whom He wishes and singles out for His mercy whom He wishes. He is truly the Mighty, the Generous. However, beseech God that you may remain firm in His Cause, for thieves lie in wait in ambush. You must, with the utmost steadfastness and assurance, preserve the pearls of the All-Merciful's love in the vessels of your hearts and keep them hidden from the eyes of robbers. Be so enkindled in the love of God that if all the peoples of the earth should arise to turn away, or should argue using the books of the ancients and the moderns according to their desires, you would pay no heed. This is the counsel of Truth, the command of Truth, and the remembrance of Truth. Blessed are you for having been mentioned in the presence of your Lord, the Mighty, the Great. And glory be upon you, O My loved ones, and praise be upon you for having turned to your Lord on the Day of Judgment.\n\n=== END BH02519 ===\n\n=== START BH02520 ===\n\nO Friends of God!

Be not grieved by the opposition of people and their turning away, for they are weak and immature. These souls must be educated with the waters of divine wisdom, that perchance they may attain to what God has ordained for them and not be deprived of His greatest bounty. Soon will most veils be rent asunder and people will arise in lamentation and wailing. Verily He is the All-Informed, the All-Knowing. Today it is incumbent upon all to invite people, with utmost wisdom and kindliness, from the wilderness of error to the plains of guidance. With perfect eagerness and longing, be occupied with the remembrance of the Day-Star of the horizons and speak His praise. The ocean of generosity is manifest, the sun of bounty is shining, and the heaven of grace is uplifted. Deprived is the one who remains bereft today, and without portion is he who has not recognized his Lord. Divine Tablets have been sent down time after time and again and again, and their purpose is that in this transient dust-heap you may occupy yourselves with that which is the cause of the perpetuation of existence. For today, whatsoever is manifested from any soul in the path of God shall remain and endure. Your mention is remembered before the Throne and the names of those who have turned to God are inscribed in the Tablet of eternity. Blessed is the soul that has recognized, the ears that have heard, the eyes that have seen, the hearts that have turned, and the limbs that have acted according to what they were commanded by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nVerily We make mention of you through Our grace, and We mentioned you before. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. Be not grieved by the clamor of the people. The Truth calls you from the precincts of the Prison - this indeed is a great bounty. Thus have We illumined the horizon of utterance with the sun of remembrance and explanation, that you may rejoice therein and be of those who are firmly established. Beware lest anything prevent you from speaking forth or the veils of the heedless hold you back. Remember God in the night season and in the days in such wise that the hearts of the heedless may be attracted. The world and all that is therein shall perish, and there shall remain for you what has been sent down from the Supreme Pen. To this testifies the Lord of Names, yet most of the people are heedless. Turn not unto them, but rather to the horizon of Revelation. This is what you have been commanded by the One Who inspires with faithfulness.

As for the travelers, they have not been and are not commanded to stay in that land, for if people gather there from outside it will become the cause and reason for certain events. Two souls had permission to stay, and later mention was made of Nabil-i-Qabli-'Ali regarding Rafi' and his companions - upon them be the Glory of God for drawing nigh and returning without entering, in obedience to their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. These are souls who have not moved according to their desires but have acted by God's leave.

Say: O people of the Bayan! Have ye found in that which was revealed unto 'Ali before Nabil aught that was not adorned with the ornament of My Name? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Were it not for My remembrance, the Bayan would not have been revealed, and were it not for My Self, the sun of exposition would not have shone forth from the horizon of meaning and utterance. To this beareth witness every fair-minded one possessed of knowledge. He made the entire Bayan as a gift from Him to My Self and a leaf from My paradise. Why then have ye turned away from Him Who sacrificed His soul in My straight and manifest path? By God! At the moment when the infidels suspended Him in the air, He inhaled the fragrance of My robe, His gaze fixed upon My countenance, His heart remembering My exalted remembrance. Say: Do ye make the Cause of God an object of mockery? Why have ye turned away from Him through Whom every thing proclaimeth what the Tree of Divinity proclaimed: \"There is none other God besides Me, the Almighty, the Gracious.\" Say: Moses drew strength from this Great Name, and the Spirit was aided by this Wise Remembrance. If ye have forgotten the Books of old, then look unto the Bayan, that ye may perchance know what God intended for you, and be not of them who cried out in separation and who, when the breezes of reunion wafted from the direction of God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, broke the Covenant and denied the Lord of the Day of Mutual Disillusion, when He came unto them with a manifest sovereignty. Say: Should anyone read what is in the Bayan, he would surely weep for My suffering and for what hath befallen My soul. By My life! Its Revealer intended naught therein save My Cause, My remembrance, and My praise. Fear ye God, O company of the veiled ones! Thus have We imparted unto thee that thou mayest remind the people in the days of thy Lord, that they may cast away their idle fancies and take the cup of righteousness through this glorious and wondrous Name. Forbid the people from that which they have been forbidden in the Book, then bid them to observe that which they have been commanded by thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: How long will ye occupy yourselves with the world? Have ye not witnessed its passing? Where are your fathers and your ancestors? All have returned to dust, and ye too shall return as they returned. This is an irrevocable promise, if ye be of them that know. Blessed is he who hath cast the world behind him out of love for God and hath turned with his heart to the Lord of all worlds. He is worthy of the pavilions of My grandeur, the tabernacle of My glory, and the canopies of My grace. Upon him rest My blessings and My tender mercies, for I am verily the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.

No one recognized Us for they were behind veils and in mighty delusion, as though none among the people had eyes to recognize the Beauty of the Ancient One after He appeared in truth by the command of Him before Whom the necks of the proud were humbled. We remained in this concealment until God's appointed time was fulfilled according to what was ordained by His Pen on a preserved tablet of glory.

When We arrived therein, We rent asunder the veils and tore away the covering with power and clear sovereignty, despite them and those who disbelieved and associated partners with God, the Mighty, the Peerless, that God's proof might be completed for His creation and His evidence for His creatures and His testimony for all created things. As for you, gird up your loins to exalt the name of God and His Cause and fear no one, but place your trust in Him, for in Him let the faithful servants place their trust. If you find a pure heart and an illumined breast, cast upon it what God has cast upon you in this blessed and wondrous Tablet; otherwise, conceal it in your heart and remain in mighty concealment.

They have denied Thy proof and Thy testimony, and have violated Thy covenant and Thy testament, and have spoken that which the Pharaohs of old spoke not. Thou hearest, O my God, what hath proceeded from their mouths and what their pens have set in motion. I know not, O my Goal and my Beloved and Ultimate Aim of my hope, what Thou hast ordained for me by the Pen of Thy decree and what the Reed of Thy destiny hath written for me. I was sleeping when the breezes of the dawn of Thy Manifestation awakened me, and I was seated when the hands of Thy power raised me up, and I was silent when the wonders of Thy grace and bounty caused me to speak. When I arose, I heard the call from all things in such wise as I cannot mention before the oppressors among Thy creatures and the rebellious among Thy servants. Then Thou didst command me to call out before the faces of the rulers and the learned ones in the world of creation. When my call was raised, the first servant who sought to shed my blood was my brother, whom I had nurtured over successive years and protected beneath the wing of my favor through the nights and days. Then Thy servants and creatures from all directions sought to harm me, and beyond them the people of the Bayan who denied the right of God and His favor, and the Manifestation of God and His sovereignty. Thou knowest what their false hands have wrought in those vain days and what their lying tongues have spoken. Thou seest me, O my God, in this station with the hands of my hope raised to the heaven of Thy generosity and my gaze expectant of the wonders of Thy grace. If Thou desirest the exaltation of Thy Word and the manifestation of Thy Cause and the establishment of Thy commandments and laws and the hearts of the sincere ones among Thy servants and the near ones among Thy creatures - and if not, then strengthen them to remain silent in Thy days and to keep quiet among Thy creation and to turn to the mountain peaks lest there appear from them that which would raise the clamor of the polytheists and the croaking of the croakers. Verily Thou art the Almighty whom the affairs of Thy creation cannot frustrate, nor the events of the world and its ornaments in Thy earth. I beseech Thee, O Lord of all beings and the One mentioned in the heart of Baha, to adorn Thy servants with the ornament of justice and fairness that they may read Thy verses and ponder Thy clear proofs and what hath appeared from Thee. I testify that in Thy grasp are the reins of those in the heavens and the earth and the reins of hearts and minds by Thy power and Thy sovereignty. O Lord! Aid me and disappoint me not of what Thou hast ordained for those who have turned to Thee with pure hearts and radiant faces. Verily Thou art the King of the Kingdom of Names and the Creator of heaven.

He is the One Who calleth before the faces of all peoples. The Most Exalted Pen is bewildered as to what it should mention. Every sect among the sects seeketh after truth, and entereth monasteries, synagogues, mosques, churches and temples in the name of truth, turning toward God in love. Yet they remain heedless and deprived of His Most Great Appearance, the Mighty Announcement, and His verses which descend like torrential rain at all times. Glory be to God! The people of the Gospel cling to two pages while remaining debarred from the Mother Book. And the people of the Furqan, despite countless verses having descended from the heaven of Divine Will and the kingdom of the Lord's decree, are seen to be heedless. The people of Iran, throughout ages and centuries, made mention of the Qa'im and clung to names, yet when the horizon of the world became illumined and distinguished by the Most Great Light, all turned away and became inflamed with the fire of hatred and animosity. In such case, what can be said? The vain imaginings of the servants have prevented them from the Dawning-Place of Divine revelation and the Dayspring of the Sun of certitude. Reflect upon what hath come to pass. Consider the vainglory of the Shi'ih sect: they deemed themselves the foremost of the world and the most exalted among nations. Yet when the balance of justice was set up, they were found to be the most lost among the peoples of the world. They spent their entire lives occupied with successor-games and likewise with other names such as Chiefs and Nobles and the like. On the Day of Judgment there appeared from those heedless souls that which hath appeared from no oppressor to this day. The divines of that sect are, one and all, engaged in cursing and reviling. Blessed are they who, with the arm of knowledge and the power of certitude, have rent asunder the veils of glory and become illumined by the lights of the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai. Praise thou the Goal of all beings, Who aided thee to turn unto Him in days when the most learned and accomplished of those parts turned away and engaged in opposition. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Goal of the world and Beloved of the nations, for having given me to drink from the cup of Thy knowledge and guided me to Thy path. I beseech Thee by the hearts which Thou hast made treasuries of the pearls of Thy love, and by the blood which hath been shed in Thy path, to make me in all circumstances steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the pharaohs of the earth nor its tyrants who have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament, and have denied Thy signs and disputed Thy proof, shall prevent me. I testify that Thy power hath encompassed all created things and Thy mercy hath preceded all existing things.

O Muhammad, grieve not because of the world and its vicissitudes. Hold fast unto this Cord, through whose movement all created things were moved. Blessed is the servant who hath witnessed and seen, and woe unto the heedless. We bear witness that thou didst forsake thy homeland and didst seek the most exalted homeland beneath the canopy of the grandeur of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful.

The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to this from this luminous horizon. Say: Beware lest the affairs of men grieve you or the might of those who have denied the Day of Judgment frighten you. Turn with your hearts unto the Kaaba of God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus have We set forth the verses and sent them unto Our loved ones, that their fragrances might attract them and draw them nigh unto the One, the All-Informed. Verily thou, O Muhammad, hast heard the call of the Wronged One and hast drunk His sealed wine in His Name, the Self-Subsisting, and hast attained unto that which was recorded in the Books of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Rejoice in this remembrance and say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, my Lord and my Support, for having guided me unto a station honored by Thy footsteps, wherein Thy call was raised and the sun of Thy grace shone forth from the horizon of Thy will.

When the veils were rent asunder and the Sun of Revelation manifested His banner according to a decreed measure, there emerged from behind the veil the buzzing of flies who objected to Him Who aided the Cause through the hosts of inspiration and revelation. They say what the Shi'ih party said, imagining themselves to be possessed of certitude. Nay, by My life! They are worshippers of idle fancies and vain imaginings. When the horizon of Revelation manifested its banner, they turned away from it, following every heedless doubter. Say: Observe, then recall the fruits of the deeds of the people of the Furqan when the Hour came and the Herald proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of all men!\" Those people denied God and His sovereignty and opposed Him with an injustice whereat the Concourse on High and the dwellers of Paradise lamented at eventide and at dawn. Hatred intensified in their hearts until they pronounced judgment against Him Who is the Desired One with a tyranny that caused the heaven to withhold its rain. Thus did their souls entice them, and today they are among the lost ones. By God's life! They committed what none before them had ever committed.

For these companions no barrier can intervene and no change can alter them. They are intoxicated with the wine of love and unconscious from the cup of longing. They are drunk with the immortal Beauty and immersed in the matchless crystal stream. Though their outer appearance may manifest as fire, their inner reality betokens light. The realm of words does not prevent them from the lofty stations of meaning, nor do metaphorical veils conceal them from the places of truth.

And He would pass through the earth and send down at every moment verses that would entrance the denizens of the highest Paradise, and clear proofs that would cause the angels nigh unto God to swoon away. By God! The breezes of verses have wafted over the East and West of the earth, and this is indeed a mighty bounty. When their fragrance reached the decayed bones, they stirred and arose by God's leave, the Mighty, the Beautiful. In those circumstances, We deposited beneath every stone the virgin verses and unique pearls of exposition. Erelong shall arise from every stone one who will proclaim that He is the Beloved of all worlds. The days passed until We reached the shore of the sea. Then did the Most Great Ocean take His seat upon the Ark, whereupon the inhabitants of Paradise cried out: \"In the Name of God be its course!\" Then they addressed the Ark saying: \"Blessed art thou, for upon thee hath settled the Hope of all worlds.\" Then the Ark sailed upon the sea, and We heard from each drop thereof what none can hear, and thy Lord is indeed cognizant of what I say. Until We arrived opposite one of the cities of the earth, We perceived from it the fragrance of the All-Merciful, and while We were inhaling the holy fragrances, the sea grew calm and the Ark came to rest upon it - though this Sea, by God, its waves shall never be stilled unto all eternity. Then there came into Our presence one of those who trace their lineage to the Son, bearing a clear book. When We broke its seal, We found therein the sweet scents of holiness from one who had been set ablaze with the fire of thy Lord the All-Merciful's love, and whom the raptures of revelation had seized in such wise that he had detached himself from all things and held fast to this Cord stretched between the heavens and earth. We read what was inscribed therein of his words, and whoso desireth, let him look upon his book that he may know how the fingers of thy Lord's power, the Most High, the Mighty, the Powerful, do transform hearts. Would that thou hadst been present with Us and heard when the Youth recited it with the melody of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the All-Wise.

After its perusal and examination, and after attaining the bounty of hearing it from the Master, He stated that if every letter were to be combined with other letters - that is, with those letters that are current and mentioned in the world of love - and were to be made to speak, that word would surely have been written either to manifest grace and bounty, or in stations of praise and description, or in stations of acceptance and good-pleasure. In truth, no mention remaineth that hath not been expressed in the realm of utterance, even though with Him are the treasuries of remembrance, knowledge and utterance, which none hath discovered save His all-knowing Self. The purpose is that your books of acceptance, sincerity, orientation, mention, praise, love and faithfulness are present before His face, and have attained both His sight and His hearing. Likewise, other books have issued forth from the court of the Wronged One and been sent. The blessing is perfect, the mercy is descending, the favor is manifest. Blessed art thou and joy be unto thee! The servant who is present mentioned thy letter before His face at this hour. Praise be to God that God's infinite bounty is all-embracing and ever-increasing. The True One, exalted be His glory, is witness and testifier to this servant's words. Would that you too had come! We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions. This prayer hath already been answered. We thank God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the Lord of the exalted seat! End.\n\nYour remembrance and mention have ever been and still are constant.

In pulpits and mosques, upon hearing His mention, they would rise to their feet and, with utmost humility and supplication, would implore His presence, crying out \"May God hasten His advent!\" Yet after the lights of the Sun of inner meanings dawned and the waves of the ocean of divine utterance surged forth, all turned away. Would that they had been content with mere rejection! They attributed to Him that which the Jews did not attribute to the Spirit (Christ), nor did the idolaters and others speak about the Seal of the Prophets. This is why the people of the Last Days have been condemned in every Book. They pronounced judgment against the One whose remembrance occupied them night and day, and denied Him Whose oneness and singleness they had acknowledged throughout ages and centuries. Reflect upon the heedlessness and error of these people. Through the vain imaginings of negligent souls, they deprived themselves of the Dawning-Place of the light of divine unity, and through the doubts and conjectures of ignorant divines, they excluded themselves from the effulgences of the Sun of certitude. Blessed art thou, and blessed is the one who has rent asunder the cord of vain imaginings and has shattered the idol of doubts through the strength of certitude. Such a one is among those companions whose remembrance God, exalted be His glory, has recorded in all the Books.\n\nO Muhammad!

Convey My greetings to the friends. We beseech divine confirmation for all, lest they be dismayed by the might of those who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds. Each of the relatives mentioned in thy letter has attained God's favor. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to strengthen them, forgive them, and ordain for them what He has ordained for His loved ones. Verily, He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. As for thy desire to attain Our presence - We have indeed manifested Ourself for this purpose, but the idolaters have intervened between Us and those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds. We beseech God to ordain for thee and thy uncle the reward of attaining His presence, and to decree for you both what He has decreed for His chosen ones.

Praise be to God that the effulgences of the Sun of grace have encompassed some and will encompass others. Soon shall they return unto God and arise to make good what hath escaped them. For every soul was somewhat heedless, or the might of oppression kept him from the Luminary of justice, yet in his days and nights he was occupied with the remembrance of the peerless Friend and was adorned with His love.

Many souls now yearn and hope to circle round His prison in His path and embrace its chains. By the life of God, these chains are preferable to a hundred thousand ornaments, for those are attributed to the Truth while these are from the sources of oppression. God protect us and you from the evil of these heedless ones. We have specially granted thee permission - accept thou it and be of the thankful.

The servants and handmaidens who have turned towards God are all blessed with His mention - some have outwardly attained His presence while for others it remaineth preserved and concealed behind the veil of chastity. All must, God willing, act according to what God loveth and fix their gaze upon the horizon of His good-pleasure. The command is in His hand and He is the Commander, the All-Wise.

Were one to observe with the eye of justice, the tongue of grandeur would utter the verse \"and few of My servants are grateful.\" Convey greetings from the Wronged One to the exalted ladies, leaves and maidservants.

The life of this world shall pass away more swiftly than a moment. Soon all that is witnessed shall return to nothingness, and that which endureth forever is pure deeds. Through pure deeds the element of dust transcendeth the heavens. O My leaves! Move by the will of the Divine Lote-Tree and be stirred by the breezes of the will of the One Beloved.

Praise be to the Goal of the worlds Who guided thee and made thee aware.

Deprive not yourselves, and forbid not yourselves from the outpourings of the All-Bountiful Lord. Ears and eyes were created for this Day. Rend asunder the preventing veils and concealing doubts, that ye may perchance attain to the lights of the Sun of Truth. Say: Whatsoever is mentioned is for God's sake and hath been and will be. Whoso heareth, heareth for his own sake, and whoso turneth away, turneth away to his own loss. Verily He is independent of the acceptance and faith of all. The acceptance of those who are near profiteth Him not, even as the rejection of the idolaters harmeth Him not. O Yahya! Give thanks unto God for having sent down unto thee that from which those who are near perceive the fragrance of His grace and bounty. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. We beseech God, exalted be He, to enable thee to preserve what He hath given thee and to draw thee near unto Him in all conditions.

Blessed are those souls who gaze upon it with the eye of insight and ponder the sweetness of God's verses and what is concealed therein of the pearls of knowledge and wisdom. Should God will, it shall be sent. Consider all aspects in this wondrous Revelation. If thou ponderest this blessed word, thou wilt understand what none before hath understood. Call the people to the supreme steadfastness, lest they be deprived of the horizon of certitude through the manifestations of doubts and idle fancies, and be veiled from the Truth by the intimations of creation. For ere long will be lifted up the cawing of the crows. Blessed is he who remaineth steadfast and is of those who are firmly rooted. All must be detached and severed from the vain imaginings circulating amongst the servants, and must fix their gaze upon that which the Truth hath commanded and doth command.

Thou didst hearken unto the divine Call when raised and perceived its manifestation above the Exalted horizon on a Day when all the dwellers of the mortal kingdom rejected the Creator of the heavens. Thou hast, moreover, discerned the Most Great Announcement and inhaled the fragrance of the garment of the Lord of Days.\n\nI testify that thou rendered victorious the Faith of God and His Cause through thy pen, thy tongue and thy hand until thou didst surrender thy life in His path and quaffed from the Kawthar (heavenly fountain) of self-renunciation in His name and in His love. Thou wast intoxicated from the spring of His Recognition and hath soared with the wings of certitude in the heaven of the murmur of thy God, the Lord of Grandeur. Over thy sufferings have all the atoms of the earth cried and the eye of creation wept.\n\nI testify that because of thee all the treasures of earth appeared and all the pearls of sea were revealed. Through thee, the pinnacle of understanding was adorned with the crown of revelation. Thou art the one who accepted the choice sealed wine in the presence of all and drank thy fill in the Name of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days.\n\nMay the resplendent glory which hath dawned from the horizon of divine grace, and effulgent light from the heaven of sanctified justice, rest upon thee and upon those who have assisted thee. For they accepted the One that thou had accepted and repudiated those who had risen against thee. With thee and under thy shadow, they rendered the Cause victorious, having beheld thee and circled around thee.\n\nO God, my God, creator of me and of the heavens, I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy Oneness, by the mysteries of Thy Book, and by lamentation of Thy loved ones in their separation from Thee, and by the tears of the pure ones on their remoteness from Thee, I invoke thee, O Thou Lord of indomitable Strength, by this sacred Tomb and by this exalted Shrine \\[Vahid's\\], to forgive me and my father, and all those who for Thy sake have approach these sacred remains, and all those who have come and will come on pilgrimage to this spot.\n\nO my God, I beseech Thee by him \\[Vahid\\] and those who have suffered martyrdom in Thy path to grant me and to those who remain faithful in Thy Covenant, the necessities of life.

He is the One Who commands in truth.\n\nO My handmaid, pass beyond that which is apparent and turn thy gaze towards the inner reality. Behold the beauty of the loved ones of God with the eye of truth. If outwardly they do not have the best of looks, inwardly they manifest such beauty that makes them the envy of all those who are beloved. The physical beauty is adored by lust and passion, but spiritual beauty is loved by God. Now which one wilt thou choose? Of course, that which is chosen by the Beloved has been and will ever be desired by His loved ones. Know thou that the outward beauty is a worldly phenomenon; its appearance seems ornamented, adorned and beautiful, but causes the foot of whosoever behold it to slip and his head laid off.\n\nOne of the chosen ones saw the world one day in its utmost physical beauty and declared it to be most adorned and beautiful. At that moment, through divine inspiration, he was moved to ask it to appear in its true form. When it appeared in its true form, he fled from it and sought refuge in God from its countenance and its emanations.\n\nThe loved ones of God, though they may not be accepted by people, are accepted in the sight of God, and if they were to appear in their true form, by God, no one would be capable of beholding the lights of their countenance. God is sufficient as a witness to this.\n\nO handmaid of God! You are related to the Truth, and those who are related to the Truth must appear before people with His attributes and fix their gaze upon His love. Wherever His love is found, there is the divine Joseph whom God will raise up in His image. Verily, He has power over all things.\n\nBehold My loved ones with Mine eyes. Be kind to the Guide, for the Beauty of Divine Unity has appeared for unity and fellowship. God has ever desired ease and comfort for His loved ones, that in these fleeting days they might conduct themselves with utmost love and fellowship toward one another. The purpose of this most great Manifestation has been unity and harmony, not separation and discord. Though the Spirit of God is in prison and afflicted with countless trials, yet He desires His loved ones to be in comfort and at ease, occupied with His remembrance and praise.\n\nThe Spirit be upon thee and upon thy father and thy mother and thy sister and thy brother who have migrated with God, and upon the handmaids of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds who are devoted to Him. Joy and gladness and delight be yours, while sorrow and imprisonment and grief be for the Beloved of the mystics. And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH02592 ===\n\n=== START BH02593 ===\n\nHe is God, exalted be His glory, the Most Great, the All-Powerful\n\nIt is abundantly clear that this Wronged One has for successive years been imprisoned in the most desolate of lands and has, in the path of God, endured that which you and others have witnessed and heard. The tribulations that have befallen the Dayspring of the Light of Divine Unity are themselves a reminder, but only for those possessed of insight, whom the veils of human limitations have not barred from the Most Sublime Vision. Were you to reflect but briefly, you would testify that whatsoever this Wronged One uttereth is purely for God's sake, and that He hath had and hath no purpose save God, glorified be His majesty, nor hath He been attracted to any direction - for He dwelleth in a station where the path of hope is severed. Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, and in these latter days deprive not yourselves of the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful, that perchance ye may receive a portion of the outpourings of the True Bestower and attain unto your share. As you have been a seeker after good, therefore that which is the cause and source of God's perpetual favors hath been cast forth from His presence. Time and again hath the divine Hand of power preserved you and caused you to attain unto the most exalted summit in your first life. However, this station is confined to the transient days. Strive that you may attain unto the Kingdom that endureth - that is, through deeds befitting these days, that their fragrance may never cease from the realm of existence and may endure through the eternity of God's names. God willing, may transient conditions not withhold you from the Truth. Were you to reflect briefly, you would acknowledge what hath been mentioned and would arise to make good what hath passed. Say: Glorified art Thou, O God of Revelation and Speaker on Sinai! I beseech Thee by the lights of Thy countenance after the extinction of all things, and by the manifestations of Thy might and power in the kingdom of creation, to ordain for me through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. O my Lord! The world hath occupied me from turning toward Thy horizon and hath prevented me from directing myself to the Dayspring of Thy Cause and the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation. Therefore have I fled from myself unto Thee and have placed my trust in Thee. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me from the ocean of Thy bounty and the sun of Thy generosity. O my Lord! Aid me in Thy remembrance and praise in such wise that the veils of the world and the clamor of the nations will not prevent me.

After hearkening to the blessed word \"Pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God for mankind,\" he turned toward the divine command until he attained the privilege of visiting the Most Great House of God. He must, God willing, count this enduring bounty as great and never be heedless of the remembrance of the All-Merciful at any time or season. He must ever be occupied with building the house of the heart, which is the throne for the manifestation of the All-Glorious.\n\nHear with the ear of the spirit the call of Him Who summons to the All-Merciful. His call is today the sweet water of life for the bodies of all beings. By the Lord of all possibility, if all who are on earth were to attain but one drop thereof, all would turn, living and enduring, toward the Object of worship. Whosoever remains deprived of this living water today is accounted as dead and as nothing in the sight of God, even as He has said: \"They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not.\"\n\nWe must beseech God, exalted be His remembrance, that He not deprive these servants, through His grace and favor, from the cloud of mercy and the heaven of bounty. This is the ultimate goal of those who seek the presence of the All-Glorious, and naught else is regarded by God. As has been observed, He has given this world and its ornaments to the lowliest of His servants. Surely if it had any worth, He would not have bestowed it upon the heedless. Thus the aim of those who believe in divine unity has been the good-pleasure of the Friend and whatsoever is from Him. As is witnessed, these most great tribulations that have befallen in this year have been sweeter than the choicest honey to the tongue of him who speaks. His is the praise and the bounty. The desire of the people of truth has been martyrdom - that is, their life is in their death. This is the true word. Blessed are they that attain!\n\nConvey mention and greetings from this servant to the loved ones of God wherever you meet them. Say: Today is the day of steadfastness and turning to the Truth. Be not grieved by the tribulations that have befallen. The Cause is in God's hands. Verily He is the Ruler over all else. If absolute power appears in the garment of powerlessness, and the Absolute Sovereign outwardly appears as one ruled and oppressed, there is no harm in this, for whatever appears from the All-Wise contains wisdom which none comprehend save those possessed of understanding. And praise be to God, the Lord of Lords.\n\n=== END BH02594 ===\n\n=== START BH02595 ===\n\nIn the Name of the All-Knowing Expounder. The ocean of true knowledge streaming from the dayspring of the mouth of the Will of Him Who is the All-Merciful hath revealed its splendour in the form of these words. The clouds of the idle fancies of the ignorant have made dark and gloomy the world's luminous horizon; while the tyranny of the rulers hath rendered turbid the clear fount of tranquillity. Yet the day is approaching when the Divine decrees will have penetrated these intervening veils, and dissipated these various impediments and obstacles. Say: O friends! What need is there for consternation, what cause for fear? Never hath there been, nor is there now, any doubt that all who are endowed with spirit shall one day be overtaken, and seized upon, by death. Such being the case, if this death be converted into martyrdom, and take place in the path of God, it would assuredly be preferable. Every intelligent and thinking person will testify that this station hath ever been, and ever shall be, the loftiest of all stations. All men are commanded to observe wisdom, and forbidden to engage in mischief, strife and contention; yet should aught befall, then with perfect resignation must they direct their steps unto the scene of sacrifice in the path of the Incomparable Friend. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of sanctity! Should a soul quaff from the cup of knowledge the crystal waters of the love of the All-Merciful, never would he be moved by the wrong of the oppressor and the onslaught of the tyrant even to sadness, how much less to fear and consternation! Please God, thou wilt acquaint all the wayfarers in the Straight Path with that which hath been sent down in this Tablet from the Pen of the All-Merciful, so that, with the utmost joy and gladness, they may be occupied with the remembrance of Him Who is the Lord of all men. Say: The Pen of the Most High affirmeth: the death of each soul is predetermined in the Book of God, neither shall it be advanced or delayed by a single moment. Is it then seemly that the lover should shrink from meeting his Beloved, or be sorrowed by the prospect of laying down his life in the pathway of the Adored One? Nay, by Myself, the True One! And yet the people for the most part apprehend it not. Say: Sanctify and purify the hearts, that they may discover a window giving onto the Most Great Ocean: thereafter neither the hosts of the world, nor the clamours of the champions of the nations, shall have the power to keep such souls back from Him Who is the King of Eternity. Do thou then beseech God graciously to confirm and assist them in such wise that they may soar up on the wings of longing unto God, the Supreme King, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. We, verily, have made mention of thee aforetime, and in this wondrous Tablet, that thou mayest be well assured of the grace of thy Lord, and mayest relate unto the people that which hath proceeded from His Most Holy, His All-Glorious, and His Most Exalted Pen.

From every word thereof wafted the fragrance of sincerity and devotion. What he mentioned somewhat lightened the sorrows that have befallen Us. None knoweth what hath befallen the Wronged One save God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. That honored one is aware what was the bounty from the Wronged One's part and what was the enmity from those people. In any case, the letter of the beloved, upon him be My Glory, was read by all, and it contained the glad tidings of the well-being of the emigrants and of thy visitation which thou didst perform by proxy the day before - this was accepted. Give him the glad tidings of My remembrance of him and My turning toward him from this distant shore. God willing, may he hold fast to the counsels of the Wronged One and strive diligently in the acquisition of sciences and arts, for knowledge and wisdom are two shining ornaments for the head and brow. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to adorn him with that which will make him honored among His servants.

Though praise be to God you have attained all that was mentioned, yet since this is the station of grace, the more that appears the better and more pleasing it is. Your mention and that of the dear honored one Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'llah has ever been before the Master. Whenever anyone is present, they first ask about your circumstances with care and kindness. I beseech Him, blessed and exalted is He, to assist you and preserve you and draw you near to Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.\n\nAs for the sum you wrote about, there was an amount in Constantinople which according to what was mentioned they sent, and it was assigned to Aqa Faraj, upon him be God's peace - give it to him. After that it is not known what happened. There was a sum belonging to Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be Baha'u'llah's peace, which is now in Constantinople with the honored Shaykh, upon him be God's grace and favor. There is nothing here. There is nothing more to mention except that I have beseeched and continue to beseech from God, exalted be His glory, blessing and bounty and mercy and favor and glory for that beloved one.

Yet when the horizon of the world was illumined with the light of the appearance of Him Who conversed with God on Sinai, all turned away save those whom the hand of grace did rescue - the hand of grace did rescue them from the clay of idle fancies and vain imaginings and drew them nigh unto Him. Glory be to God! Through one exalted Word the reckoning of the peoples of the world was completed, and the blessed word \"the most swift of reckoners\" was established in its station.

O Hakim, O Ibrahim, the hand of wisdom and power of God, glorified be His majesty, took hold of thee and caused thee to attain the light of guidance from the fire of heedlessness. O Ishaq, when thou didst turn unto Him thou became worthy of divine mention. O Yusuf, the hand of the favor of the Goal of the worlds delivered thee from prison and drew thee to the arena of mighty glory, and illumined thee with the light of guidance from the station of darkness. O Yusuf, the friends have ever been and shall ever be beneath the glances of grace.

Counsel My loved ones to be so steadfast that neither the name of the Prophet, nor the mention of the Successor, nor the names of the Noble One and the Chief, nor the Cords and the Pillars shall prevent them. Thus has the matter been decreed from the presence of an All-Wise Commander. Say: This is the Day of God wherein mention of aught else beseemeth not, if ye be of them that understand.

They run about in the valley of error and say \"Where is guidance?\" Say: Here is the Lord of creation! They hasten in darkness and say \"Where is the light?\" Say: Open your eyes! Verily it hath shone forth from the horizon of glory with power and sovereignty. Among them is he who turned away and said \"Where are the signs which we were promised in the Book?\" Say: They have all appeared while ye were beneath the veils. Rend them asunder through My Name; then shall ye behold the Sun of grace shining from the horizon of might. Among the people are those who are veiled by vain imaginings from their Lord, the Self-Subsisting, and among them are those who cling to tales of old, cut off from this Cause through which the worlds have been illumined.\n\nSay: O people! Fear God and follow not what your idle fancies command. Follow Him Who, when He speaketh, all things speak: \"There is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower.\" The call of God hath been raised from the precincts of the Prison; hasten unto it, O people of understanding. Act not as did the servants before you. Beware lest the veils of glory prevent you from turning to the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Ye were created for this Day and were promised this Remembrance around which circle all remembrances. Is there any who will hear the verses of God and recognize what is treasured therein of wisdom and mysteries?\n\nO My loved ones! Grieve not over those who speak according to their desires. By My life! They are among the companions of the left hand. Be ye My trustees among My servants, the dawning-places of My justice among My creation, and the daysprings of My courtesy among My creatures. Thus doth your Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen One, counsel you.\n\nBlessed art thou for having attained unto the lights of knowledge in the days of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, and for having turned unto Him after most of the servants were prevented therefrom.

Yet the eyes of those who manifest self and passion, tyranny and corruption remain deprived of witnessing it, and their ears are barred from the warbling of the birds circling round the Throne. How excellent is that power which breaks the chains of idle fancy through the Most Self-Subsisting Name and rends asunder the veils of vain imaginings through the Name of the Lord of all beings, which passes beyond all else save God through the light of detachment and makes for the depths of the ocean of oneness. O people of God! Some among the servants have been observed to be of such frail character that, like clods of earth, they fall apart at the slightest moisture. O 'Ali-Qabli-Naqi, upon thee be My glory! He who beareth My Name, upon him be My loving-kindness, forwarded thy letter to the Most Holy Court. The fragrance of the love of the Desired One wafted from it. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who hath clung to My firm cord, detached from all the worlds. Whenever through divine power the pavilion of glory was raised up and the lights of the manifestation of Him Who conversed on Sinai shone forth, a swarm of flies emerged from the thickets of hatred and set about undermining the Cause. Reflect upon God's concealment and patience, and likewise upon the greed and avarice of the antagonists and opponents. One who received the utmost kindness from the friends of the Cause arose in opposition and united with his own kind, busying himself with plundering possessions on the day of reckoning, selling the Joseph of trust for a few counted dirhams. He showed no mercy either to himself or to the Cause of God. Glory be to God! The deniers of the Bayan are still consumed by the fire of hatred. At the instigation of those treacherous souls they have arisen to commit betrayal. Say: Praise be to Thee, O my God, and thanks be to Thee, O my Desire, for having kept the hems of Thy loved ones pure from the dust of treachery, lying and calumny. I beseech Thee, O King of the kings of the kingdoms of justice and fairness, by Thy command through which the lights of bounties and favors were made manifest, to make me steadfast in Thy love and a drinker of the choice wine of Thy revelation in every one of Thy days. O Lord! Take my hand with the hand of Thy grace, then open before my face the doors of Thy generosity and riches. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. The calumnies of Thy servants harm Thee not, nor do the descriptions of Thy creatures profit Thee. Thou doest what Thou willest through Thy power and ordainest what Thou desirest through Thy will.

Existence itself testifieth to its non-existence when face to face with the manifold revelations of Thy transcendent oneness, and every created thing confesseth, by its very nature, its nothingness when compared with the sacred splendors of the light of Thy unity. Thou hast, in Thyself, been independent of any one besides Thee and rich enough, in Thine own essence, to dispense with any one except Thy Self. Every description by which they who adore Thy unity describe Thee, and every praise wherewith they who are devoted unto Thee praise Thee, are but the traces of the pen which the fingers of Thy strength and power have set in motion -- fingers whose movement is controlled by the arm of Thy decree -- the arm itself animated by the potency of Thy might.\n\nThy glory beareth me witness!

What, then, can this poor creature hope to achieve, and to what cord must this wretched soul cling?\n\nI beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of the worlds, and the Beloved of such as have recognized Thee, and the Desire of all that are in heaven and on earth, by Thy Name through which the cry of every suppliant hath ascended into the heaven of Thy transcendent holiness, through which every seeker hath soared to the sublimities of Thy unity and grandeur, through which the imperfect have been perfected, and the abased exalted, and the tongue of every stammerer unloosed, and the sick made whole, and whatever was unworthy of Thy highness and beseemed not Thy greatness and Thy sovereignty made acceptable unto Thee, -- I beseech Thee to aid us by Thine invisible hosts and by a company of the angels of Thy Cause. Do Thou, then, accept the works we have performed for love of Thee, and for the sake of Thy pleasure.

The Supreme Pen has in scriptures and tablets informed all of the appearance of the cawers, the heedless ones, and the atheists. Now from certain directions the cawing is raised. The Author of the Bayan commanded all to recognize the Promised Beauty through His own eyes and not to consider anything else as proof of His recognition, for He is known by His own Self and all else are His creation. This statement is specific to this Manifestation, yet the heedless people remain veiled from the Truth and occupied with vain imaginings, appearing like the peoples of former times. We beseech God to grant justice that they may not be deprived of the outpourings of the True Bestower in His days. Convey My greetings to the friends and give them the glad-tidings of God's infinite favors. Say: Pay no attention to the fly and its buzzing, nor to the crow and its cawing. Soon they shall return to their abode as returned those who wronged in those days. By the life of God! What they possess shall perish and might and power shall remain with God, the Lord of all worlds. The glory shining from the horizon of My loving-kindness be upon you and upon your brothers and upon those who have cast aside vain imaginings, holding fast to My Strong Cord.

How many a poor one hath been seized by the breaths of the verses and how many a prince hath turned away from God, the Lord of existence. By God's life!

Such hath been the extent of transformation that those endowed with insight and knowledge are bewildered. Differences have encompassed the world. Blessed is the one who hath sanctified his heart, his sight and his hearing from the world and whatsoever is therein of traces and fruits and stories and reports, and who hath, with his own sight and hearing, pondered upon that which hath appeared.

The helpless servants accepted from those heedless souls that which led them astray, and on the Day of Retribution they witnessed and heard its consequences. In the early years all the divines of Persia engaged in cursing the Goal of all creation. They committed that which no group had ever committed and perpetrated that which no soul had ever perpetrated. The lamentation of all things hath been raised, and the sighs of the Concourse on High have ascended. The Pen weepeth and maketh mention, the Tablet weepeth and beareth witness.

Nevertheless, it is observed that some have strayed from the straight path of wisdom, which is the foundation of God's Holy City. For instance, they give meat instead of milk to the infant, and poison instead of healing to the sick. Say: O ye who are turned toward the horizon of guidance! Ye are the spiritual physicians and true healers. Ye must consider the requirements of the times, the days and the souls. How can one who is disturbed by mention of divine authority be capable of bearing mention of divinity? Souls who considered themselves among the mighty ones and learned of the Bayan were struck down by mention of divinity - how much more so those souls who were raised in the Dispensation of the Furqan and were afflicted for centuries at the hands of the divines of idle fancy. Waste not the seeds of divine wisdom on barren ground. Speak according to the capacity of each soul - all things have their measure with Him. The seeking child must be nourished with the milk of praiseworthy character and goodly deeds, and afterward with the sweet fruits of divine authority and the like, until reaching the stage of maturity. At such time, if sustained by mention of divinity and lordship, no harm shall come. It is most clear that every soul has been and will be a seeker after the knowledge of God, and the cause of rejection, objection, heedlessness and ignorance has been the vain imaginings with which they were formerly raised. The rending of these imaginings is most difficult, save through the measures of sanctified and perfect souls. The mercy of God hath preceded, as is observed in how His Sacred Being conducts Himself with the utmost kindness, mercy and compassion toward His servants.

What seeker has ever raised the hand of supplication and been left disappointed from the hem of His generosity? What true lover has ever kindled the fire of love and been denied access to the Tree of Union? The doves upon the branches of the divine Tree and the birds of celestial holiness have ever called out: \"O beloved ones! The Traceless Beloved is manifest and visible as the radiant morn - open the eyes of both head and heart! O ye who are ill, the spiritual Physician has risen like the true Sun - turn not to yourselves!\" Indeed, the robe of forgiveness befits those who repent, and the garment of bounty and favor becomes the sinners. Yet there has been and shall ever be a distinction between the sincere and others. The friends must demonstrate steadfastness and sanctification from all else, else all distinction would vanish. In brief, all existence, to the extent it possesses any fairness, bears witness that this servant has never had any purpose save the attainment of these loved ones to the holy retreats of the Lord of Lords. In all aspects, from the highest station of the Cause to the lowest rank of creation, there was agreement and fellowship. Through all these stages the purpose was that a few might be cleansed of limitations and veils of human nature and enter, pure, into the realms of detachment and abstraction, fixing their hearts on another nest and hastening to the eternal shore - that perchance a few might attain to holy spiritual delights. And it has been clear that whatever people are commanded to do is for their own benefit, as is evident in that whoever failed to comply has descended even in outward rank, let alone in the stations of holy detachment. God the One is witness that this servant feels utmost shame before the companions \\[of the Bab\\], for your association was renowned among the people, who all longed and yearned \\[for such station\\], yet matters ended as you know. I call God, His angels and His Messengers to witness that I have forgiven you for what your hands have wrought, and I beseech God to make firm your steps and open before your face that which will make you independent of all else and bring you to a station where you turn only to Him and are occupied with naught but Him.

May you, God willing, manifest joy and delight through the sweet savors of the utterance of the All-Merciful at all times. Look toward the Supreme Horizon and what He hath manifested through His power and sovereignty. The earthly temples and artificial souls were not and are not worthy of mention. The Truth hath come for the reformation of the world and none hath the power to prevent Him. Pay no heed to the might of the oppressors this Day. Say: Consider what He hath manifested through His power that hath encompassed all existence. At times they kill, at times they imprison, and at times they lead into captivity. Nevertheless, they have been and remain defeated, while the Cause of God is ever ascending. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of divine favor that such bounty hath been vouchsafed unto His loved ones as hath no likeness or parallel. Soon shall its effects be made manifest and evident in the earth. O thou who gazest upon the countenance! Such a station hath been conferred upon Jinab-i-M.Sh. that, should he remain firm and preserve it, all shall soon speak his praise and bow before his name. Say: Know ye the value of this station and arise to serve. However, observe wisdom and utterance in all conditions. Ever fix your gaze upon wisdom. The fire of corruption hath been kindled in the lands, but God hath extinguished it through His power. Blessed is he who is endowed with insight! How many signs and evidences have appeared and continue to appear, yet the people remain heedless. A hundred thousand souls have returned to their abode in fulfillment of what God revealed in the Surih of Ra'is, yet the people have not become aware. The founder of the edifice of tyranny - that truthful liar - was seized by the hand of divine wrath, yet none took notice. And He seized one greater than him, yet it yielded no fruit. Soon shall a third join them both. Verily thy Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful. Should the entire world arise to prevent it, by the life of God, they shall find themselves impotent, and whatsoever He hath willed shall assuredly appear. Verily, He hath power over all things. Say: O loved ones of God! What behooveth you is steadfastness in His Cause, and what behooveth Him is grace and bounty and loving-kindness. He shall surely give you your rewards. Be assured and be of those who are firmly established. Glory be upon thee and upon those who act in accordance with what hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH02630 ===\n\n=== START BH02631 ===\n\nIn the name of the Friend without name or trace!

The letter that was sent to the friends in the land of Alif was presented before the Countenance. They had inquired about new tidings. The new tidings are that in these days it was mentioned that the ruler of the great city heard that a sandal belonging to the Prophet, peace be upon Him, was in the possession of a nobleman in Diyarbakir. Therefore an order was issued from the government to bring it, and the mentioned person arrived with a messenger at the Black Sea shore. Afterwards multiple ships were specially sent from the great city to receive it and transport the trust. And as they approached the great city, numerous other vessels were sent and the bearer with the trust was settled in the royal vessel as they proceeded to the city. Upon arrival at the seashore, the Grand Vizier and all the deputies and ministers came to receive it and were waiting. After arrival the Grand Vizier approached and took the trust, placed it in a most distinguished carriage, and the bearer of the trust rode behind the carriage on a most distinguished horse, followed by all the ministers and deputies as they proceeded to the special place that had been designated. On the right and left of the carriage walked a group of clergy with censers of incense, chanting glorification and praise, until they arrived at the appointed place. After the arrival, the ruler and other people came in successive groups for three days to attain the bounty of visiting it. Now is the time for reflection and awakening. Observe how they cling to the branch while remaining heedless of the root. Thus it has ever been and ever shall be. Even as in these days no one has paid attention to the imprisonment of those souls, but ere long they shall speak of the details of what befell you. More detail than this is not permitted in this station. We send greetings to the friends.

Say: Through the Word of God are drawn those servants who are as the essence of creation, in all that was and will be. Say: Verily the Word is God's magnet between the heavens and the earth, did ye but know it. Through it God draws unto Him the essence of what He hath created and casts aside the dross - this is of His justice, though ye understand not, save when ye drink from the Kawthar of inner meanings from the cups of the utterance of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. They who have disbelieved - these are the dead. If they find the path of God they take it not for their path, but if they see the path of idle fancy, that is the path they tread. When the melody of God is raised they heed it not, remaining heedless thereof, but when the braying of asses is heard, then do they hearken. This is because they have turned away from the All-Merciful and taken Satan for their helper. Thus have their souls enticed them, yet they perceive it not. Say: O people! The Beloved hath appeared in manifest glory, and before Him march the hosts of divine revelation and inspiration, while behind Him advance the hosts of the unseen with upraised standards. Fear ye God, follow not the promptings of your souls, and be not of them that wander distracted in every valley. Rejoice, O people of Baha, in this Most Exalted Paradise, which hath been adorned with the ornaments of realities and utterance. Thus hath it been ordained for you by God, the Mighty, the Best-Beloved. Whoso entereth therein shall never leave it, and whoso leaveth it hath never truly entered. Thus hath the matter been decreed in a Tablet wherein is inscribed what hath been veiled from the eyes of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Turn not thy gaze from the Most Great Vision, then drink the water of Kawthar in the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Pure, and fear not the idolaters. Thus have We taught thee in truth that thou mayest stand firm in the Cause of thy Lord and be detached from all the worlds. Arise to promote the Cause, then gather the servants unto the law of God, and be as the spring breezes unto them, that their souls may be renewed through the ornament of the name of the All-Merciful in these days, the Inaccessible, the Mighty. Beware lest anything hold thee back from that which thou hast been commanded. In all matters place thy trust in God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Shatter the idols by My power, then rend asunder the veils by My strength, then tear away the shrouds of vain imaginings by My Name and My sovereignty, and be not of the patient ones.

Thou hast faced Him from Whom all creatures have turned aside, except those whom God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, hath desired. Dost thou know toward Whom thou hast shown love? I shall make it clear unto thee, that thou mayest attain unto clear certitude. Thou hast loved Him Whose hatred hath filled the scrolls of the world, as every discerning one doth testify.

Say: Praise be unto Thee, O my God, for having made me assured of Thy Manifestation and for having caused me to acknowledge that which the Tongue of Thy grandeur hath spoken. Were it not for Thy grace, who would deliver me from the pit of idle fancies and the sea of vain imaginings? I testify that through Thy bounty Thou didst save me, and didst make known unto me Thy path, and didst guide me to Thy momentous Announcement, whereby hearts and minds were shaken, except for those whom the hand of Thy favor had seized - a grace from Thy presence.

Rejoice in that We have answered thy prayer and supplication and forgiven those for whom thou didst seek forgiveness from the ocean of thy Lord's mercy, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. We have indeed cleansed them of transgression as a bounty from Our presence. Verily thy Lord's mercy hath preceded and His loving-kindness hath encompassed all who are in earth and heaven. Be thou turned toward the Face and draw nigh unto Him, speaking His praise and arising to serve His Cause, remembering what We showed thee in the Prison in the most exalted station. We have permitted those whose presence thou didst desire before the Prisoner, and We counsel them to observe wisdom lest their departure raise the clamor of those who have denied God, the Lord of all mankind. Say: O people of Baha! Take ye wisdom from Us and transgress not beyond it. Thus have We commanded you in the Scriptures and Tablets. We have accepted thy presence and thy visitation on behalf of God's loved ones and companions.

Some of the friends, influenced by the clamor of the ignorant divines, have seized them. By the life of God! The people remain in their ancient error. Those souls who speak for the sake of God and are turned toward Him have been cast into prison due to unwarranted and unproven suspicions, thinking they could extinguish the light of God and quench His fire. Far, far from it! Even if all who are in the heavens and earth were to unite to prevent that which God hath willed, they would never be able, never have the power, and would find themselves utterly impotent.

The cause of this heedlessness are those souls who, in former ages and countless centuries, prevented people from the Kawthar of the utterance of the All-Merciful. If man were to meditate for but an hour for the sake of God and comprehend the cause of the people's turning away from the Lord of creation, he would cry out \"I believe in Thee, O Thou the Goal of the world!\" The Truth hath appeared with the proofs of the first and the last, yet the people remain in evident veils.

Hold fast unto it, O My servants, then act according to that which God hath revealed in His wondrous Tablet.\" If those souls who have turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and who are known throughout all regions by the name of God had acted according to this exalted and divine word, assuredly the banner of \"Verily He is God\" would have been seen raised and planted upon the hills and mountains of the earth.

A hundred thousand regrets that most of the people are heedless of what they see and hear. The Most Great Bell hath been adorned by the fingers of the mercy of the All-Merciful in the midmost heart and the divine call hath been raised. Yet the people are seen to be withered, nay rather dead, save whom thy Lord willeth. Do they not inhale the fragrance of the utterance and remain heedless, or are they deprived by what their hands have wrought? O My Name! Thou knowest that at all times the tongue of the All-Merciful is engaged in utterance and at every moment the Most Exalted Pen is in motion. Not for an instant hath there been any pause in the manifestation of the Cause, yet the blind are deprived of the mirror and the deaf are forbidden from hearing. Ask thou of God that He may purify the eyes from the ophthalmia of desire and free the hearts from the veils that hinder. Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One and arise with utmost resolve to serve. By the life of God! This is what will profit thee and make manifest thy station and preserve thy remembrance, that perchance through the effulgences of the Sun of divine bounty the servants may become illumined and sense such a station that the splendor and worth of these outward, ephemeral stations may be erased from the heart.

We had previously made mention of him who ascended unto God with such remembrance as caused the fragrance of the loving-kindness of the All-Merciful to be diffused throughout all creation, and We mention him yet again as a token of Our grace.

The glory proceeding from Us be upon thee and upon him who hath remembered thee and whom We remember through that which hath been sent down from My Most Exalted Pen, as a favor from God, the Lord of Lords. The ocean of forgiveness surged when the Tongue spoke, and the pavilion of pardon was raised in the most exalted station. Previously there came a letter from him who was named with the letters Ta and Qaf. We made mention of him with such remembrance as illumined the horizons. O My Name! The loved ones have ever been and continue to be remembered. We have made mention of Habibu'llah, upon him be My glory, and continue to mention him in the nights and days. Even as the rain of verses hath been sent down and clear proofs made manifest, yet still have the deniers sullied with the clay of idle fancies that station which is sanctified above the hearts and minds, and attributed weakness unto it. Say: Behold, behold the waves of My ocean of utterance before the faces of the world. Hearken, hearken unto My most sweet call amidst the nations. Among them is he who hath said that He hath stolen the verses of the Point and sent them down in His own name. Say: Woe unto thee, O thou idolatrous doubter! By the life of God!

Would that they were present to witness with their own eyes the effulgent rays of the Day-Star of divine utterance. They have clung to names and turned away from Him through Whose word the kingdom of names was created. In any case, they were and are unworthy of mention. We make mention of the loved ones. O Taqi!

Blessed is he in that he drank the choice wine of utterance from the hand of the bounty of his Lord, the Most Merciful. The effect of this is evident from his words - through clear proofs he silenced the opposing souls. No fair-minded person has had or has any reason to pause, let alone to turn away and deny. I testify that he prevented the transgressor from ascending and repelled him with a piercing flame, in the name of his Lord, the Powerful, the Triumphant. God willing, he will be assisted and confirmed in all conditions. This is the meaning of \"victory\" that is mentioned in the Book of God.

Nevertheless, the perverse ones and the barking dogs have arisen in denial and are occupied with rejection and protest. Say: Be fair, by God, and follow not those who have denied God's proof and His evidence, and who pronounced judgment against the Dawning-Place of His verses and the Herald of His Cause in the land of Ta.

In such case, no part or limb or member of yours should turn to other directions or become sorrowful for any worldly matters. O My leaf! With your outward ear today thou canst not compare the call of \"O My leaf! O My handmaiden!\" with any joy in the world.

Verily thy Lord is the All-Patient, and He commandeth all to beautiful patience. Say: My God, my God! My sight seeketh Thy vision, my hearing the listening to Thy call, my heart turning toward Thee, and my soul sacrifice in Thy path. Make this handmaiden detached from all else save Thee, and occupy her with Thy mention, praise, love and nearness. Wert thou to become aware of what hath been ordained for thee from the Divine Word, thou wouldst attain unto such joy as would not be altered by the duration of the kingdoms of earth and heaven, nor prevented by the vexations of this dusty world. O My handmaiden! O My handmaiden! Rise above the ranks of grief and sadness and turn to the horizon of sanctification, detachment and transcendence. This is the station of the leaf who hath attained unto the blessed word \"O My handmaiden.\" Sorrow is not permitted save in the tribulations that have befallen the Sun of Truth. Take hold of the hem of My grace, detached from all save God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and this exalted station. We make mention at this time of My handmaiden who hath ascended and arrived in the vicinity of the mercy of her Noble Lord. We have remembered her with that which hath attracted the hearts of every discerning mystic. Upon her be My glory and the glory of My handmaidens and the countenance of the denizens of Paradise who circle round the Throne by night and day.

For one thousand two hundred years they considered themselves, in their own estimation, the most learned and knowledgeable in the world, and in the nights and days they were engaged in mentioning the Promised One. Yet when the Sun of Truth shed its radiance and the horizon of the world became illumined, they became like clouds that intervened and prevented its rays. Finally they issued the decree for His death, as you have all heard and seen. In the early years, not a single one of the divines showed acceptance or attained to the Cause of God. All arose in such obvious opposition as had never been heard of in creation. The divines and their followers, one and all, engaged in cursing and vilification, and committed that which no oppressor had ever done. Even now in all lands the fire of hatred is ablaze. Well is it with them that are endued with insight! The people of the Bayan are now freshly uttering those same words and committing those same deeds. At times they say the Bayan has been corrupted, and at times they say that which no idolator has ever said. Say: O people of God! Strive to protect people from the vain imaginings of these souls, that perchance they may soar with the wings of freedom in the luminous atmosphere of glory and attain unto true unity. These are the counsels of the True One, exalted be His glory, unto His loved ones. Blessed is he who hath heard and hath attained unto the most great steadfastness in this mighty Cause. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The Glory be upon thee and upon My loved ones who have not broken My covenant and My pledge, who have arisen and have said: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\"\n\nO Ha and Sin! Thou hast ever been mentioned in the presence of the Wronged One and art beneath the glance of His favor. Praise be to God that the effulgences of the sun of divine love are dawning and shining forth from the horizons of hearts, and thy remembrance hath been inscribed by the Pen of loving-kindness upon the crimson scroll. Give thanks unto thy Lord for this manifest grace. We beseech God, exalted be He, to assist the white faith and the radiant Law and preserve it from the evil of the idolators who have cast behind them the Covenant of God and His Testament and have committed that which hath made the eyes of the righteous to weep. And we beseech Him to exalt the people of unity even as He exalted them before.

It became known that thou art \\[distressed\\] over the non-appearance of imagined matters and \\[thinkest\\] that divine assistance is through gold and the exaltation of the Word is through silver. God forbid! O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! Thou art among those souls who have dwelt for years beneath the shade of the Tree, and after the intoxication of things and the thunderstruck state of most people, thou didst turn thy face toward the Countenance and didst bear hardships in the path of God. All these matters have been revealed and sent down from the Most Exalted Pen in the Book of Names. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of Divine Glory that the treasures of the first and the last, and whatsoever existed in and is now visible upon the earth, cannot equal these aforementioned stations. Preserve this station. Let not ugliness seize this good name. This hath ever been and shall ever be acceptable in the sight of those who possess the Most Great Elixir. O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! The Most Great Elixir hath been the Word of Truth, which the Hand of Power hath manifested from the Hidden Mine through the Hidden Name. Nurture it in the retort of the heart with the fire of love, and after its effect appeareth in all the pillars, if but an atom thereof be bestowed upon the people of possibility, thou shalt behold all the copper of existence transformed into pure gold. This is the Most Great Elixir, with whose mention the Pen of the Ancient of Days hath been and is occupied. O 'Ali-Qabli-Akbar! From thy words, constriction of breast and heart was observed - that is, they indicated thy grief and distress. This is most strange. This was and is certainly not befitting thy station. Thy heart must be illumined by the Name of Truth and thy breast must appear more vast than the kingdom. This beseemeth thee and those souls who have, in the path of God, drunk from the cup of hardship and tribulation. Water at all times the tree of hope with the water of divine bounty, that it may remain verdant and flourishing and its effect may become manifest in creation. This is the counsel of the Wronged One, the advice of the Wronged One, and the utterance of the Wronged One. God willing, thou art accounted among those who hearken in His presence. Blessed art thou, and those with thee, and those who have believed in God, the Lord of the worlds.

On this blessed Day there hath appeared that which had been hidden from eyes and sight. Today mercy hath preceded all else and the divine bounty hath encompassed all, such that there hath been revealed for every soul among those who have turned towards Him that which the servants are powerless to comprehend. Say: O servants of God! He hath come with the knowledge of \"He doeth what He willeth.\" Should He prefer an atom to the sun, or a drop to the ocean, all must accept it, for none knoweth the requirements of divine wisdom. Today the servants must bear witness to the sovereignty of God, glorified be His majesty, and submit to whatsoever hath been revealed and recorded by the Supreme Pen, which is the Self of Truth. The Exalted One hath said: \"The entire Bayan is but a leaf among the leaves of His Paradise. Should He accept it, verily He is to be praised in His deed, and should He reject it, verily He is to be obeyed in His command.\" Whosoever holdeth fast to that which hath been mentioned shall be preserved from the terror of the Most Great Day. Say: O servants! Know ye the value of these days and deprive not yourselves of the outpourings of the Most Great Name. Fix your gaze upon the divine signs that perchance ye may drink from the cup of utterance of the Goal of all existence that which bestoweth eternal life and everlasting existence. Praise be to the Lord of existence and the Sovereign of the seen and the unseen, Who hath mentioned thee through His supreme grace - a mention that is eternal and everlasting. If thou hast attained unto this Tablet and drunk the choice wine of proof from the wellspring of its words, enlighten the people and send a copy of this most mighty, most holy Tablet to the friends of God, that they may drink of the Kawthar of utterance and receive their portion from the choice wine of grace.\n\nO Shaykh!

He has ever been and continues to be hidden, His path closed off, and seeking in this station forbidden. And since the gate of attainment was closed and people were debarred from knowledge of the hidden treasure, He chose pure essences and holy souls and sent them from the higher realm to the kingdom of creation, that they might guide all and lead them to the straight path. Each of these holy souls, for God and in His path, bore infinite tribulations and made people somewhat aware. Some denied, others turned away, while a group became assured and believed, and a band became polytheists and hypocrites. Blessed are those souls who were illumined by the lights of the dawn of truth and turned toward the highest horizon.\n\nAll these Prophets and Messengers were commanded to wisdom - that is, each spoke and revealed the Cause according to the capacity and measure of the people.

Cast the world behind you, then turn unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Grieve not over the world and what befalleth therein. Observe and reflect upon its passing and its changes, O company of the knowing ones! Who hath laughed therein and not wept? Who hath built and not perished? It and all that is therein shall pass away at every moment, yet the people are in manifest heedlessness. How many a palace hath been emptied, how many a spring hath dried up! He who amasseth therein loseth, while he who spendeth is accounted among the beneficent. Be not reassured by its prosperity nor disturbed by its loss.

By this We rejoice within Our souls and thank God, Our Creator, with a truthful, clear tongue.

He dwelt among you for successive years, His countenance shining like the light of dawn from a brilliant morning horizon, yet ye, O heedless ones, knew Him not, until God's way was fulfilled in His own Self and He migrated from your land to a distant country. Then did the eyes of eternity weep, and the livers of the mystics were consumed, and the hearts of the lovers.

Nay, rather, Our eyes are gladdened at the descent of tribulation, for it appeareth from the Beloved, and thereby it becometh sweeter than every delicate sweetness.

Twice there was revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will especially for them that which hath no likeness or parallel. Before thy letter, by the space of several days, it was sent. One Tablet was also revealed in reply to the petition of Muhammad-Hashim and was sent to the honored Haji Mirza Husayn to deliver.

Such is the condition of the people and their measure. Thou shouldst at all times be thankful to the Beloved of all existence that He hath aided thee to turn towards Him. Whosoever hath attained this supreme honor in this Day is mentioned among the inhabitants of the most exalted Paradise in the Book of Names, and the Pens of the Kingdom of Utterance are unable to describe his station. God will soon make manifest the stations of those who have turned to Him and arisen to serve His Cause. Verily, there is none other God but Him. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. There is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Convey My greetings to thy son and give him the glad-tidings of My grace and favor, that he may hold fast to that which shall profit him in all the worlds of his Lord. Exert your utmost effort and striving to preserve this lofty and most exalted station, for the satans lie in ambush and the Cause is in God's hands, the True Sovereign, the Manifest. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to assist you both, draw you near, grant you the good of this world and the next, and ordain for you what He hath ordained for those who are brought near.

Glory and power belong unto God, the Lord of all religions! Thou art he whom neither the doubts of the skeptics nor the signs of the transgressors deterred. Through thee the clouds rained down and the Herald proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth to God, the Lord of Lords!\" Alas, alas! How many a day didst thou spend in chains and fetters, and how many a night didst thou hear the taunts of the people of error who in the end denied God, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High! Thou art he who showed patience in hardship and tribulation in the path of God, Creator of heaven, and who wast with Me in prison in days when the fire of hatred blazed in the hearts of the idolaters who rejected the truth with their own inventions, violated His covenant and testament, disbelieved in His signs and proof, and denied what was sent down from the heaven of His Will and appeared by His command and shone forth from His horizon. Through thee and thy like were opened the gates of bounty upon the faces of all beings, and the Pen of the Lord of eternity was set in motion in the realm of creation. Thou art he at whose calamity every seeing one wailed and every informed one cried out, every just one wept and every fair-minded one was confounded, and by what befell thee arose the lamentation of those near unto God and the cry of the sincere ones. I testify that thou didst not hesitate in the Cause of God thy Lord, and didst perceive the fragrance of the Revelation when it was wafted throughout the world. Through thy calamity hearts were melted and lands were changed. I testify that thou didst turn and believe on a day when the earth shone with the light of its Lord and the heaven with its Creator and Fashioner. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of God's loving-kindness, the Goal of the mystics, be upon thee and upon thy beginning and thy end, thy outward and thy inward self, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Glorified art Thou, O Light of the world and Attractor of the hearts of nations! I beseech Thee by the Most Great Name to forgive me and my father and my mother. Then I beseech Thee by the Trust which Thou hast concealed in this station to ordain for me the good of the hereafter and of this world.

Hearken unto the spiritual call from the divine Lote-Tree in the Persian tongue, that thou mayest become quickened by the sweet melody of the All-Merciful and make alive and enduring the body of contingent being. This is not difficult for God. Take thou the wine of \"Am I not?\" from the hand of the one true Beloved and drink, that thou mayest become intoxicated and ascend from this transient realm to the eternal realm beyond space, and attain unto the Most Holy Outpouring which is sanctified above mention and utterance. And after ascending to this ultimate goal, turn thou to the people of creation that through divine grace thou mayest draw all to this spiritual wine toward the realm of oneness. This indeed is an exquisite wine for those who drink thereof. How excellent is the state of that soul who today has attained unto this cup and partaken thereof. Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup wherein is mixed camphor. O Shaykh! Consider the various sects among the people of the Path, how they all counted themselves among the people of insight, yet when the Sun of Truth dawned from the divine horizon of God's Will, most remained deprived of the Dayspring of guidance and the Dawning-Place of His most beautiful names due to the veils of self and desire. This is not the first flask that was shattered in the path of Truth, nor the first veil that was rent by the deeds of mankind. Consider the past: when the Sun of Truth shone forth from the horizon of Hijaz, how many stones of denial and objection were cast by the people of hypocrisy and metaphor at that Lote-Tree that is neither of the East nor of the West. They said: \"We found our fathers following a religion, and we are guided by their footsteps.\" God willing, may you in this soul-refreshing morn drink the cup of success in the name of the Cleaver of Dawn, and give others to drink, and remain detached and sanctified and free from all the worlds. Say: O nightingales, the Rose is manifest and evident, and O lovers, the Beauty of the Beloved is bright and radiant as the true dawn. Now is the time for singing, now is the time for sacrificing one's life. We beseech God to make you shine like a lamp of guidance among the people of your land, that all may benefit from your breath and find their way to the All-Bountiful. Verily, He has power over all things. Whosoever was truthful in saying \"We belong to God\" will surely attain unto \"unto Him do we return\" in this Revelation of the Hidden Name.

I swear by the pearls of the divine ocean of knowledge that this word is greater than whatsoever is in heaven and earth. Through God's grace thou must remind the servants, by day and by night, through wisdom and utterance, that perchance they may become aware and be adorned with the ornament of certitude after being cleansed of vain imaginings. All people are in need of education. They who are endowed with insight must turn their attention to this momentous matter. The flowers of the rose-garden of the world drink and are nurtured from two streams: knowledge and vision. Whoso hath not attained unto these two hath never truly existed, nor doth he now exist. That which today causeth the exaltation of the Word of God is goodly character. Say: O friends! The Pen of the All-Merciful declareth: Strive that ye may be adorned with such virtues as will cause the elevation of your station and glory. Ye have dwelt for a time beneath the Lote-Tree and have hearkened with your own ears to the words of the Wronged One. Say: Today befitting deeds and pleasing words are needed. Every goodly deed is in itself a teacher of the Cause. The proof of this utterance is what hath been recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Tablets. Were a man in this day to adorn himself with the raiment of trustworthiness it were better for him in the sight of God than that he should journey on foot towards the holy court and be blessed with meeting the Adored One and standing before His Seat of Glory. Trustworthiness is as a stronghold to the city of humanity, and as eyes to the human temple. Whosoever remaineth deprived thereof shall, before His Throne, be reckoned as one bereft of vision, though in the sharpness of sight he be as Zarqa of Yemen. Render thanks unto God for having made thee aware and granted thee the meeting which was mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of all worlds. This is a matter which all the Messengers gave glad tidings of. Well is it with him that hath attained thereunto, and woe betide the heedless. Gird up the loins of service and occupy thyself with the remembrance of thy Lord. The bounties of God are descending like rain from the heaven of His Will. He is, in truth, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

However, we have concealed their names - you too should conceal them. Verily your Lord is the Concealer. This matter is necessary, namely attention to those two places. And now those two individuals have departed. Some of the imaginary hosts have also passed through those regions. Glory be to God! Most of the servants are occupied with previous vain imaginings and have not realized that those vain imaginings of the previous party produced no fruit, such that now they should again remain deprived of the Lord of Names through vain imaginings.

Nothing shall profit you, no soul shall show you mercy, none shall deliver you, and all shall tremble at the might of the Cause. Have mercy upon yourselves and make up for what ye have neglected in regard to God; then ponder His Cause. And thou thyself bear witness that there is no God but Him, the King, the Powerful, the Self-Subsisting. And if thou hearest of My departure from that land, be not grieved or troubled, for therein lie mysteries that none can comprehend save those who perceive with the eye of God in His Cause.

There hath come upon Me that which hath come upon no one before, and God is witness to this and is All-Knowing. Say: O people! This is the Most High among you who hath come to you with God's signs, His power and sovereignty, His grandeur and majesty. Fear God, O people, and be among the God-fearing. Dispute not with Him through what your selves and desires command you, and wage not war against His exalted and mighty Self. O people! Look with the eye of the beginning at that whereby the Cause of the Prophets and Messengers was established. Fear God and differ not in His Cause, and nullify not your deeds through satanic suggestions. Satan commands you to transgression and indecency, while this Youth commands you to fear God, and this is indeed a mighty bounty. Answer God's summoner among you and follow not those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and were among the polytheists. And thou, O servant, convey the Cause of thy Lord to those who are veiled by the veils of idle fancies from the beauty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, and who were among the veiled ones, that they may detach themselves from what they possess and turn to what hath been ordained for them in the preserved tablets of glory.

From eternity Thou hast, in Thy transcendent oneness, been immeasurably exalted above Thy servants' conception of Thy unity, and wilt to eternity remain, in Thine unapproachable singleness, far above the praise of Thy creatures. No words that any one beside Thee may utter can ever beseem Thee, and no man's description except Thine own description can befit Thy nature. All who adore Thy unity have been sore perplexed to fathom the mystery of Thy oneness, and all have confessed their powerlessness to attain unto the comprehension of Thine essence and to scale the pinnacle of Thy knowledge. The mighty have all acknowledged their weakness, and the learned recognized their ignorance. They that are possessed of influence are as nothing when compared with the revelations of Thy stupendous sovereignty, and they who are exalted sink into oblivion when brought before the manifestations of Thy great glory. The radiance of the brightest luminaries is eclipsed by the effulgent splendors of Thy face, and the tongues of the most eloquent of speakers falter under the unrestrained effusions of Thy holy utterance, and the foundations of the mightiest structures tremble before the onrushing force of Thy compelling power.\n\nWho is there, O my God, that can be deemed worthy to be remembered when Thou art remembered, and where is he to be found who can be regarded as capable of hinting at Thy nature or worthy of mention in the court of Thy transcendent oneness? From everlasting Thou has been alone with no one else beside Thee, and to everlasting Thou wilt continue to be one and the same. No God is there beside Thee, the God of power, of glory and wisdom.\n\nGlorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thine exalted and supreme Remembrance, Whom Thou hast sent down unto all Thy creatures and invested with Thy name, the All-Glorious, Whose will Thou hast ordained to be Thine own will, Whose self Thou hast decreed to be the revealer of Thine own Self, and His essence the Day-Spring of Thy wisdom, and His heart the treasury of Thine inspiration, and His breast the dawning-place of Thy most excellent attributes and most exalted titles, and His tongue the fountain-head of the waters of Thy praise and the well-spring of the soft-flowing streams of Thy wisdom, to send down upon us that which will enable us to dispense with all else except Thee, and will cause us to direct our steps towards the sanctuary of Thy pleasure and to aspire after the things Thou didst ordain for us according to Thine irrevocable decree.

The Sun of Eternity shone upon her in what was revealed to her of the mysteries of the Pen through destiny. Through this she desired to enter the gardens of Thy nearness and the paradise of Thy reunion, that she might erase from the tablet of her heart all reference to aught else but Thee, and that there might be kindled in her heart the fire of Thy oneness and there might radiate from her innermost being the light of Thy uniqueness.\n\nWhen she drew near to the Tree of Thy divinity and sought refuge in its leaves, and held fast to its branches and found shade beneath it and tasted of its fruits, she journeyed unto it and migrated with it toward it until she reached its nearness.

Yet none can attain unto this, O my God, except those who were created from Thy Self and appeared from Thy Beauty and returned unto Thee and entered the chambers of Thy glory and arrived at the mansions of Thy majesty, for Thou art He Who giveth unto all things their due measure. Despite my recognition of this, I beseech Thee to make her detached from all else but Thee. Then cause her to know Thyself that she may be freed from all else save Thee, for if a servant knoweth Thee he would not be occupied with aught else nor engaged with other than Thee nor turn to any besides Thee, though he be given all that is in the heavens and earth.

We have heard what you testified to in the days of God and have accepted it as a grace from Us. Verily your Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. Give thanks to God for this supreme bounty which has appeared from the Ancient King, then preserve it in the name of your Lord, the Mighty, the Chosen. Say: O people of the earth! Fear God and follow not those whom veils have prevented from the Source of verses. Break the idols of fancy and imagination in the name of your Lord, the Possessor of all names.

The Hidden Treasure has appeared and the Concealed Mystery been revealed. Then did the learned flee from the field, for vain imaginings deluded them such that they denied God, the Lord of the Final End. They behold the signs of God yet deny them - thus do their souls entice them. When the Call was raised and the Cloud bore witness to the Lord of Lords, say: O people! This is the Day you were promised in the Books of God. He has appeared in truth, and in it the Balance has been set up, the Path made manifest, and the mountains passed away. Turn with illumined hearts to the Most Exalted Horizon. This is what you were commanded in the Scriptures and Tablets.

Beware lest ye divide the religion of God and His Word, and be ye steadfast in all that ye have been commanded through the gems of knowledge and wisdom. Then detach yourselves from all else and turn with your entire being unto His Beauty. By God! We have loved you before and We love you now, and We counsel you to fear God Who created you and sustained you with the good things of His provision and caused you to know the Manifestation of His Self and sent down unto you that which hath made you independent of all who are in the heavens and on earth. Therefore give thanks unto Him with your hearts and remember Him with your tongues. Beware lest ye go astray after God and His signs, and follow not every ignorant multitude, nor pursue those who have taken their idle fancies as lords beside God. Be ye pure in heart before God such that your feet slip not and your souls be not troubled. By God! Whoso hath taken the covenant from his Lord will accept no covenant from any other, and whoso hath turned unto Him will turn unto none else. Moreover, I counsel you, O loved ones of God, to be patient in this most great terror and to be forbearing in this tribulation, and to be as fire amidst the wicked and as light amidst the righteous. Further do I counsel you not to spread corruption in the earth and to be God's trusted ones among His servants, such that the signs of sanctity may appear from your faces and the lights of detachment from your temples. By God! The world and its ornaments and embellishments shall pass away, and naught thereof shall profit you. And whoso is not adorned with the attributes of God shall not be reckoned as His own - this is a truth in which there is no doubt. Whoso maketh mention of aught else shall not succeed in His remembrance, and whoso drinketh the love of any other shall not attain unto the love of his Lord. Therefore strive within yourselves to reach such station in your love that ye move not save by His leave, nor turn save unto the paths of His good-pleasure, nor speak save that which ye are commanded in His Book. Thus did We counsel you before and thus do We counsel you at this time of separation from the shores of Iraq.

Yet the people of Iran, despite this mighty and evident Cause whose fame and exaltation have encompassed the world, remain listless and dispirited. O friends! Know ye your worth and station.

Nevertheless, the people have forsaken such souls and have clung to the deed of Hadi the misleader, who for the sake of a two-day life forsook eternal life, and for the comfort of numbered days denied God, exalted be His glory, and His Manifestations.

But veils of the deluded have enveloped the people, save him who has cast away desire and turned to the horizon of guidance. He is among the people of Baha, inscribed in a Tablet by the finger of your Lord's will, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.\n\nThe Ancient Beauty has been established upon the throne of His Most Great Name, and calls the peoples unto this luminous Dawn. Say: The morning has dawned from the horizon of Syria - thus was it ordained by One mighty and powerful. This is a land wherein We raised up servants possessed of great sovereignty, who arose to aid the Cause of their Lord - verily, they are among the Messengers. This is a land wherein the call of the Spirit was raised and wherein Moses heard \"Verily there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Generous,\" and wherein Abraham proclaimed \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\"\n\nO My loved ones!

We have desired for them that which is better for them than all that hath been created in secret and in public. They are people who mention the name of God throughout the land. It behooveth them to manifest that which will cause the fragrance of the musk of unity to be diffused throughout all regions. Blessed is he who hath drunk this pure wine from the fingers of the mercy of his Lord, the Creator of all existence. God willing, you must at all times be engaged in the remembrance of the All-Merciful and expend your complete effort and striving for unity and the gathering of the loved ones, so that the fragrances of unity may become manifest from that city which has become the place of God's captives, among all people, and all the friends in surrounding areas may testify to the unity of those souls. This is better for them than what was and what will be. Regarding the daughter of Aqa Muhammad Rida, what \\[you wrote\\] was noted. His relatives are under the gaze of divine favor. If there has been delay in the manifestation of apparent favors, it has been due to lack of means. God willing, divine favors will encompass them.

And as for what thou didst mention regarding thy dream, We beseech God that there may appear from thee one who will aid the Cause of his Lord and mention Him among His servants in such wise that all created things will remember Him thereby. Verily, He is powerful over all things. Excellent is the name by which thou hast named him.

Nothing whatsoever escapeth Our knowledge, and with Us is a perspicuous Book wherein We have detailed every wise command. Therein is the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be. Verily thy Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: O people! Are the paths of error better than My straight and manifest path? Say: What aileth you? Have ye turned away from God and followed your own desires? Have ye any refuge besides Him? Nay, by the Lord of all worlds! Whoso followeth My guidance, verily he dwelleth in an exalted station, and whoso turneth away from My face, he is indeed among the companions of the fire. Say: Beware lest ye lean towards them that have wronged, and follow the polytheists. Say: The guidance of God hath appeared in truth and this is His sovereignty, would ye but perceive. Do ye reject it after it hath come from the heaven of utterance with His Most Great Name? Beware lest ye differ concerning this mighty Cause. Do ye object to Him through Whom was established that which was sent down in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing? He calleth you, even under the sword, to draw nigh unto paradise, while ye are in grievous error. He hath indeed come with the waters of life, while ye count yourselves among the dead in manifest loss. Say: Cast away what ye possess and take what We have commanded you from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Wise. Have ye found any truth in what the people of the Furqan (Qur'an) say? Nay, by your Lord, the All-Merciful! They are among the liars. Ponder what they say concerning the news of the Qa'im, and thou shalt find them in manifest error. They have clung to their own desires; verily they wander distracted in the valley of idle fancies. Say: With Us is the knowledge of all things, and We possess a preserving Book. Fear God and follow not those whose striving hath been lost in this world's life and who are among the most wretched of evil folk. As for thee, turn away from them, then turn with all thy being to God, the Most High, the All-Praised. Say: O my Lord! Praise be to Thee for having enabled me to recognize the Manifestation of Thy Self, after all the deceitful and stubborn ones turned away from Him.

Were that which is concealed therein of the revelations of his Lord to be unveiled, all who are in the heavens and earth would swoon away, save those who have held fast to the cord of God, the Mighty, the Wise. Say: O people, be fair before God - does it befit anyone to object to Him Whom Moses begged to meet, Whose beauty the Friend sought, to Whose love the Spirit ascended, and for Whose sake the Point sacrificed Himself? Fear God and follow not every sinful idolator. Have you found in the Bayan that which you did not find carrying the fragrance of My remembrance? Nay, by your Lord, the All-Merciful, were you but aware. He proclaimed in the wilderness of the Bayan and gave you glad tidings of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Then He came with mighty sovereignty. He testified of Me and informed you of My kingdom and dominion. What ails you that you cling to idle fancies and turn away from your Lord, the Most Glorious? This is naught but manifest loss. Say: Do you imagine We desire aught for Ourselves, though We be in the hands of Our enemies? Cast aside your imaginings - the Sovereign of certitude has come. They who cling to aught else but Me are in manifest error. Their likeness is as one who casts the Living Waters behind him and hastens to the mirage. He is of those who wander distracted. We sent unto you aforetime 'Ali with a wise remembrance that he might acquaint you with My Self and prepare you for My meeting. Yet when I unveiled My beauty and came in My glory, you denied My Self. Woe unto you, O company of the heedless! Say: O peoples of the worlds, have mercy upon yourselves and forsake not the Ancient Beauty. How long will you follow vain desires? This is your Lord, the All-Glorious - turn unto Him and be not of the losers. O thou who art illumined with the light of Baha! Make mention of My servants with My name and sovereignty, that they might hold fast to the truth and leave those who have disbelieved in God, the Mighty, the Powerful. Recite unto them the verses of thy Lord, that they might be drawn to the Dayspring of Revelation and be numbered with the steadfast. Say: O people, make up for what you have missed in the Cause of God. Beware lest you be among the heedless. Soon will the messenger of death come unto you - then shall you behold the power of God and His sovereignty, and find no intimate friend. Seize your chance in the days of your Lord - this is better for you, were you but aware.

O servant! Thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned of thy love for God. Thus should it be with those who have believed in God, who have detached themselves from whatsoever is repugnant to His good-pleasure, who have shattered the idols of polytheism through God's power, and who have turned with their hearts toward the holy court. These are servants whom God shall raise to a station that is in truth praiseworthy. Give thanks unto God, thy Lord, for having aided thee to recognize the Manifestation of His Self, after the Sinaitic spirits fell unconscious upon the dust of heedlessness and the spirits of light were annihilated in the wilderness of polytheism. Thus was the matter decreed from the presence of the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling. Say: O people! Fear God and associate not with Him unto Whose face ye bow down at eventide and at dawn, and oppose not Him Whom ye remember throughout all your days and Whose verses ye recite that were sent down in preserved tablets of glory. Strive within thyself lest the whisperings of Satan cause thee to slip from thy Lord's path, the All-Merciful, for he hath appeared in every city in a different form and garment. Thus do We inform thee of the truth that thou mayest become aware of that which was hidden from the eyes of the heedless. Soon shall the call be raised in every city and thou shalt find the people fearful and trembling from the power of the Cause. Thus was the matter irrevocably decreed in the Tablets. Take heed lest thou grieve over what hath befallen thee in God's path. Verily nothing escapeth thy Lord's knowledge and He is indeed cognizant of all things. Be patient, then show forth patience, and place thy trust in God in all matters. Verily He watcheth over thee. Should thou find one who is receptive, impart unto him the words of thy Lord, and shouldst thou find one who turneth away, pay no heed to him and dispute not with him. Be thou firmly established in wisdom. Thus have We commanded thee and mentioned thee that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be mindful of thy Lord's remembrance at all times.

The most exalted among them is but a subject, and I am, in truth, the Sovereign. I have come with a Cause that was, in the Tablet, mighty.\n\nWe have delivered unto the kings the messages of their Lord, and neither their might nor the tribulations that have befallen Us have deterred Us.

We have sent down unto them clear verses and dispatched them with a power from Our presence, that they might know that tribulation preventeth not the Beauty from speaking that whereby the hearts of the righteous are gladdened, while he that hath been deprived of the breezes of revelation is sorely troubled.\n\nBlessed art thou for having attained unto the recognition of thy Lord and turned unto the Qiblih of all horizons with a heart that was, in the love of God, steadfast. Let not the words of the idolaters grieve thee. They are as ashes upon which blow tempestuous winds, rendering them scattered dust. Will any endure with his sovereignty? Nay, by thy Lord, the All-Merciful! All in creation shall perish, and sovereignty shall remain with a Sovereign Who hath been, from everlasting, in truth, great.\n\nRemind them that have believed and give them the glad-tidings of that which hath been sent down from before the Throne.

Fear God and shed not His blood, nor hang Him as ye hanged Him before, and deny not what hath been sent down unto you from God, the Mighty, the Beloved. O people! Have mercy upon yourselves and oppose not Him through Whom the faith of all who are in the heavens and on earth was fulfilled, and unto Whose grace all do turn. Follow Him Who asketh no recompense from you and conveyeth unto you what the Spirit hath cast into His illumined and praiseworthy breast. Open your eyes and behold the Cause of your Creator with your own eyes, not with the eyes of them that are veiled by their own selves. Purify your ears from the words of those from whom ye detect the odor of perfidy, then hearken unto the melodies of God, your Creator, and be fair in His Cause. He commandeth you naught save what ye were commanded by God, and at every moment He conveyeth unto you that which draweth you nigh unto your Lord, the All-Merciful, and sanctifieth you from the breaths of them that join partners with their Lord. O people! Aid your Lord, the All-Merciful, and abandon not His Cause into the hands of them that soar in the atmosphere of idle fancies and desire to turn men away from the Ridvan of God, the King, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Convey the Cause of your Lord and be not silent concerning the wonders of His remembrance, and be not of them that remain silent. Verily your Lord, the All-Merciful, created the tongue for His remembrance - remember Him and withhold not yourselves from the shore of His grace, and follow not every rejected denier. Thus doth the Dove counsel you upon the branches of the Tree of Eternity, that haply the holy breaths may draw you away and bring you nigh unto the summit of intimacy, the scene of your Lord, the Mighty, the Beloved. Thus have We cast upon thee the truth that thine eyes may be solaced thereby and thy heart be at rest, and that thou mayest be severed from them that are not guided by the signs of God.

Fear ye God and hesitate not in a Cause which was promised you in all the Tablets and by which were gladdened the eyes of the denizens of Paradise and those who circle round the Throne. Then bring forth the Tablet by thy Lord's leave. Say: I have brought you God's Tablet and His traces. Have mercy on yourselves and dispute not about verses at which minds are stupefied. We know not by what proof ye believed in God's Messengers of old, nor in what valley ye do walk. If thou findest them stirred by the breezes of the Lord of Names and Attributes, then impart unto them that which will draw them nigh unto God. Otherwise, leave them to themselves, then turn toward God. He will suffice thee above what was and what will be.

We beseech God to set right the affairs of the Siyyids and We command them to unity and love and to that which God hath revealed in the Book.

We have answered thee with a Tablet before which all tablets have bowed down, and with a mention that hath gladdened the eyes of them that are nigh. The Wronged One hath heard the cry of thy heart in thy love for God and thy yearning in separation from Him, and hath witnessed thy turning toward this Station which hath been named with the Most Beautiful Names in the Crimson Book and the Most Great Prison in My perspicuous Book. Thou art he who hath turned toward My horizon and attained unto My love and recognition and hast drunk the choice wine of My tender mercy from the hand of My bounty.

Keep this most exalted station hidden from the eyes of the heedless and the veiled ones, for the treacherous have ever lain in wait for the precious gem.

The most learned of that people was seen to be the most ignorant, and the most God-fearing among that people was seen to be the most wretched, for they reviled from their pulpits the Object of the desire of all the worlds, and finally issued the verdict for His death. And some of the opposers of the Bayan witnessed with their own eyes and heard with their own ears the deeds and words of those souls. Nevertheless, because of a false successor and an imaginary name and Imam and the like, they turned away from Him Who spoke on Sinai and the Lord of the unseen and the visible. What more can this Wronged One mention, and to whom shall He speak? Reflect a little on what was mentioned, that thou mayest lament the state of this Wronged One and realize the depths of His despair. Blessed art thou for having turned towards Him when the peoples of the earth turned away, save whom God willed. Thy letter was received before the Wronged One. We found it adorned with the ornament of steadfastness, speaking in remembrance and praise of God, holding fast to His firm cord, acknowledging that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath acknowledged, and firmly convinced of what God hath revealed in His perspicuous Book.

Between Me and thee stand ignorant servants who have broken God's covenant and His testament, denied His signs, and rejected His proof, His sovereignty, His might, His strength and His power. We beseech Him, exalted be He, to record for thee the reward of meeting Him. Verily, He is the Almighty, the Powerful, and worthy to answer prayers. Let not the happenings of the world and the affairs of nations grieve thee. Be steadfast in serving the Cause and speaking forth this momentous News.

I swear by the Sun of Truth, which is sanctified above the comprehension of the peoples of the world, that whosoever ariseth to render assistance, even to the extent of a needle's eye, is accounted before God among those who are nigh and the sincere ones. Take up the chalices of prosperity in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn, and despite the enemies, drink and give others to drink. The True One, exalted be His glory, hath been and will ever be with you. Verily He hath heard your call and hath mentioned you in verses the like of which were not known in God's knowledge. This is the most great bounty which hath in this hour been revealed from the Pen of the Most Great Name. We beseech God to ordain in every gathering a bounty and to bestow a great reward. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The Tongue of Grandeur beareth witness to your acceptance and your turning unto the horizon wherefrom the world was debarred, having followed in the footsteps of the heedless. We beseech God to raise through you the standards of His mention and the banners of His praise amongst His servants, and to make you the dawning-places of His light, the daysprings of His virtues, the manifestations of His names and the sources of His bounty which hath encompassed all existence. He, verily, is the Powerful over what He willeth. He is the One, the Single, the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O Pen! Make mention of him who was named Muhammad before Baqir, that he may rejoice in the Kawthar of utterance which hath flowed from the Pen of the All-Merciful in this mighty Prison. Verily He remembereth him who hath turned unto Him, and He is the Kind, the Generous. The most great glad tidings are these: that whosoever attaineth unto acceptance, in that very moment his mention appeareth from the Tongue of Grandeur, and thereafter the evidences thereof shine forth from the realm of the Pen. A hundred thousand blessings upon those who have attained and are detached! We make mention of him who was named Ali before Akbar. We beseech God to assist him and strengthen him in that whereby his name may be exalted among His creation. He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Praise be to God that the people of the gathering have attained unto that which shall endure eternally in the Kingdom and the Realm of Might through the special Will of God.

These are they whose names are celebrated by the tongues of the world and before whose names all nations bow down. My tongue of grandeur beareth witness to this, and the kingdom of Mine utterance, and this Pen which moveth in the arena of knowledge; and I am the All-Informed. Verily those who have attained unto imprisonment have attained unto the mention of My Most Exalted Pen, and this is more precious than all else - by the life of God, nothing that hath been created between earth and heaven can equal it. Blessed, then blessed is he who hath been adorned with the ornament of steadfastness. He is among the most exalted of creatures in the Book of God. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing. Convey My greetings unto their faces and say: Blessed be your faces, for having turned toward the Face of God, and your hearts for having drawn nigh unto the Ultimate Goal, and your souls for having advanced toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Ye have drunk the cup of tribulation in My path; drink ye now from the hand of My bounty My Most Glorious Wine and My Most Pure Kawthar. I say unto you: \"Well is it with you! May it do you good!\" in the Kingdom of Creation. Thus doth God make mention of you with the most excellent mention. He, verily, is the All-Bountiful. Rejoice ye in My Name, then drink ye in remembrance of Me. We have turned toward you and We send greetings unto your faces from this beauteous spot. I was saddened by your grief, but am now gladdened since God maketh mention of you by His own Self, in recompense for what ye have wrought in His straight Path. Were My loved ones to taste the sweetness of tribulations in My path, they would offer gifts in My Name unto Mine enemies in gratitude for what they have done unto them, for through them they have attained unto this station wherein the Ancient Beauty maketh mention of them in this Great Prison. They have purchased for themselves a station in the Fire, while for you is a station at My Most Great Scene.

They have wrought that which hath caused the Most Exalted Pen to lament, and the Tablet of God wherein were inscribed the mysteries of the first and the last.

By the life of God, all things have wept by reason of what hath befallen the Wronged One at the hands of those who denied after We created them for pure truth and made known unto them the straight and manifest path of God. Should anyone ask thee concerning the Glory, say: Verily, He is under the claws of hatred. Alas, alas, for that which hath befallen Me from every oppressor, from every sinner, from every liar, from every heedless one, from every denouncer, from every vain imaginer, and from every deceitful traitor. Should anyone ask thee concerning the Divine Lote-Tree, say: Verily, It is beneath the swords of the people. Alas, alas, for that which hath befallen the Wronged One from the hosts of the wicked ones. Some among the people have been seized by the smoke of idle fancies. Because of this hath the eye of My inner being wept and the sighing of My heart been raised.

Indeed, even this mention is itself counted among all mentions, even as it hath been said aforetime that \"the believer cannot be described.\" This is a Day wherein God hath made the highest among the people lowest, and the lowest highest.

If thou wouldst turn with the ear of divine nature unto all created things, thou wouldst hear from every atom thereof what the Interlocutor heard. Say: O people! I am verily the Youth of God, Who hath come unto you with clear signs and a perspicuous Book. I manifested Myself aforetime under the name of 'Ali and took from all in the world, by His tongue, the covenant of My Self. Among them some were veiled and some turned towards God, and they that turned are now in gardens of delight. O people! He is My Beloved and I am His Beloved.

Be thou steadfast in the Cause through God's power and might, in such wise that shouldst thou be opposed by all who are on earth, thou wouldst not be perturbed in thy soul but remain steadfast with manifest constancy. Thus it behooveth those who claim relationship with God - these are His sincere servants. Say: O people! Create not disorder in the land and oppose not those who have opposed God. Leave them to themselves - they are among the dead. Commit not that whereby the dignity of the Cause will be lost among the people. Fear God and be not of the wrongdoers. The shedding of blood hath been forbidden in the Tablet. Beware lest ye transgress that which hath been set down in the Book. Do that which ye have been commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. O people! Cast not behind your backs the ways of God, neither follow your own ways. Thus have ye been commanded in all the Tablets, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should ye find one who is receptive, turn ye unto him and remind him with wisdom and utterance, and shun the rejecters. Verily, those who create disorder in the land - the harm of their deeds reverteth upon the Tree of the Cause, and this is indeed a grievous wrong.

Therefore know thou thy worth and thy station, and be thou in the Cause of thy Lord as a blazing fire, that through thee may be consumed the hearts of those who in their own selves accept not God, to such extent that shouldst thou witness with thine eyes one who opposeth God's command, pluck out thine eyes from their sockets and care not about this, that thou mayest be numbered among those who with their whole being turn unto God. Guard thou thyself and those whom We have entrusted to thy house and placed their reins in thy grasp, and then those women who dwell round about thee. Command them on Our behalf to veil their faces from those in whom ye perceive heedlessness of God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Ye see that they are aflame with the fire of self. Thus have ye been commanded in truth - act ye according to what ye are bidden. Say: Those who turn away from the Beauty of Holiness and accept aught else, these have lost both this world and the next, and all their deeds are in vain, except for those who have repented and returned - these are the companions of Paradise and shall enter into God's mercy. Say: O people! Are ye content with this vain life while turning away from the dominion of immortality in the presence of Beauty? Say: Let not your deeds deceive you, and trust not in your actions, but trust in Him Who through His grace gave you life from the water that flowed from the Pen of holy concealment, and trust not in yourselves but in God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people! God will test you with a river - whoso draweth nigh unto it is not of the truth, and whoso turneth away from it is verily of the people of eternity, and this is a promise that shall in truth be fulfilled. There shall appear in this land the manifestation of the letter D, who shall call the people unto Satan, and this is a matter that hath been irrevocably decreed in the Mother Book, and God shall test you thereby that He may distinguish who is rejected from the truth.

Beware lest ye deny the verses of the All-Merciful after they have been sent down in truth with mighty sovereignty. Say: He Himself hath been a proof unto all the worlds, and what hath appeared from Him is evidence of Him, would ye but be assured. Say: He alone hath stood up amidst the hosts of enemies and hath aided His Lord until He was imprisoned in this far-off land. Beware, O people, lest ye render your deeds null and void and reject the truth by what ye possess. Fear God, O concourse of believers! Place not your trust in what ye possess, but in that which is with your Lord, the All-Merciful, and it shall suffice you in truth and make you independent of all creation. Whoso harboureth My love in his heart, the denizens of the Concourse on high shall inhale its fragrance, then the dwellers of the cities of eternity, then Our servants who glorify God. Purify thy heart from the allusions of them who have disbelieved, then rend asunder the veils suddenly through My power and sovereignty, and fear not the oppressors.

Thou art he who journeyed to Zawra, traversing the paths until thou didst enter the seat of the Throne and didst hear the call of God, the Lord of Lords. Thou didst hasten and present thyself, and didst arise before the Gate which the Concourse on High circle round in the nights and days. Blessed art thou, for thou didst drink the choice wine of reunion and didst attain unto that which was promised in the Scriptures of God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. I bear witness that thou didst believe when the horizon of Manifestation was illumined by the Sun of Knowledge, and thou didst hear for the sake of God the taunts of every opponent, and didst bear in His love what most of the servants were powerless to bear. Upon thee be My glory and the glory of them that are in the most exalted Paradise, and the glory of those who circle round the Throne at eventide and at dawn. We make mention of thy son from whom We perceived the fragrance of My love. We testify that he soared in My atmosphere, heard My call, drank the Kawthar of My bounty, turned toward My horizon, spoke My praise and confessed that which the Tongue of Grandeur did confess: that there is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. He was named Fath'u'llah in the Book of his Lord, and the Supreme Pen hath mentioned him in diverse Tablets, as the Mother Book doth testify. We were with him when he ascended unto Us. By My life! We found from him the fragrance of sanctity. When he ascended, the Concourse on High welcomed him with luminous standards until he entered a station whereof were but a needle's eye to be revealed, all things would cry out: \"By God, this is a noble station!\" Upon him be My glory and My mercy and My bounty which hath preceded all created things. We make mention of thine other son. Verily thy Lord is the Mighty, the All-Forgiving. We have forgiven him as a token of Our grace and mercy from Our presence, and have ordained for him that which rejoiceth the hearts of the righteous. Thus hath My bounty encompassed My loved ones who have turned toward My horizon and My face while most of the people in the lands turned away.

I make complaint unto thee concerning those who claim to love Me yet commit that which grieveth My heart, who follow their own desires and abandon that which they were commanded by One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. Thou knowest that should people witness any unseemly act from those who claim to love Me, they would attribute it to Mine own oppressed and lonely Self. Say: O people! True virtue lieth not in claims but in godliness and in following My glorious path between earth and heaven, and in being a banner of guidance in the kingdom of creation. This is what God desireth for those who have entered the stronghold of My Cause and then the garden of their Lord's good-pleasure, the Almighty, the Powerful, the Peerless, the Wondrous. Say: O people! Fear God and contend not with anyone, nor wage war against any soul. Leave the world and all that is therein to its people, and spread not corruption in the land after it hath been set in order. Be ye of them that are detached. Remind the people with goodly counsel and transgress not what ye have been commanded in the Tablets. Be not of the heedless. Say: O people! If ye believe in God, follow what We enjoin upon you in truth and follow not the ways of the corrupt. Hold fast to the handhold of godliness - verily it is the ladder unto the source of names and attributes. This is My counsel unto you, if ye be of them that act. Know then that the mewing of cats hath been raised up, then the barking of dogs, and behind them the howling of wolves, then the grunting of swine - if thou be of them that hear. How then can the scratching of the Pen be heard in mention of the mysteries of pre-existence? Fie upon them who have disbelieved in God and deprived themselves of the melodies of wondrous glory. Blessed is he who hath detached himself from those who disbelieved and from what they possess, and hath made his deeds pure for the sake of God, the Powerful, the Supreme, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus have We imparted to thee and informed thee of what hath befallen Us, that thou mayest inform the people, that they may stand firm in the Cause and be of them that are steadfast.

Be ye ashamed before God and speak not what the tongues of the people of the Furqan have spoken, but detach yourselves from what ye possess and turn unto the Beauty of the All-Merciful, Who hath dawned from the horizon of paradise with a holy and luminous beauty. Then know thou that thy letter hath come before Us and We have learned what was therein. God shall soon reward thee with the best of rewards. He is the Guardian of the sincere ones. We have sent down for every soul mentioned in thy letter a Tablet that all the kingdoms of the heavens and earth cannot equal.

Consider carefully the words of him who hath associated partners with God, which he wrote to thee, that thou mayest discern from the repugnance of his words the repugnance of his soul. God is Most Great! The weak and ugly bird hath claimed equality with the eagle soaring in the holy and sanctified heaven, and the perishing ant hath claimed the station of Solomon! Say: O thou who hath associated partners with God! The barren earth can never immerse itself in the holy divine sea, nor will it ever be able to do so. Know thy worth and station, and transgress not beyond thy rank. Rise not in rebellion against the King through one word of Whose command a hundred thousand like thee have been created. This is the mighty decree that hath issued from the Most Great Pen. Say: O thou rejected one, essence of Nimrod and manifestation of all Jews! Dost thou say God's hand is chained up? Chained up be thine own limited hand! Thou hast disbelieved in what thou hast said. Seest thou not that God's hand is outstretched in truth over all the worlds? In brief, thou and the other loved ones must guard yourselves well in these ephemeral days from the devastating winds that blow from the direction of the manifestations of polytheism. O Ahmad! Be steadfast in the Cause of God thy Lord, and in all times soar in the atmosphere of His love. Then drink from the choice wine of His bounty, then speak forth in His praise, then make mention of the wonders of His Cause, then thank Him for having made thee to be mentioned before Him and for having made thee to be among the successful ones. Leave the polytheists and their idols behind thee, for this will profit thee in this world and the next. Then ascend at all times to thy abode, the station which God hath purified from every stubborn denier. At all times be engaged in the remembrance of the All-Merciful and summon the people to the direction of the All-Glorious. This is the fruit of human existence in this time and all times.

How high the reward of him that hath not deprived himself of so great a bounty, nor failed to recognize the beauty of His Best-Beloved in this, His new attire.\n\nSay: O people! The Lamp of God is burning; take heed, lest the fierce winds of your disobedience extinguish its light. Now is the time to arise and magnify the Lord, your God. Strive not after bodily comforts, and keep your heart pure and stainless. The Evil One is lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by the light of the name of the one true God, deliver yourselves from the darkness that surroundeth you. Center your thoughts in the Well-Beloved, rather than in your own selves.\n\nSay: O ye that have strayed and lost your way! The Divine Messenger, Who speaketh naught but the truth, hath announced unto you the coming of the Best-Beloved. Behold, He is now come. Wherefore are ye downcast and dejected? Why remain despondent when the Pure and Hidden One hath appeared unveiled amongst you? He Who is both the Beginning and the End, He Who is both Stillness and Motion, is now manifest before your eyes. Behold how, in this Day, the Beginning is reflected in the End, how out of Stillness Motion hath been engendered. This motion hath been generated by the potent energies which the words of the almighty have released throughout the entire creation. Whoso hath been quickened by its vitalizing power, will find himself impelled to attain the court of the Beloved; and whoso hath deprived himself therefrom, will sink into irretrievable despondency. He is truly wise whom the world and all this is therein have not deterred from recognizing the light of this Day, who will not allow men's idle talk to cause him to swerve from the way of righteousness. He is indeed as one dead who, at the wondrous dawn of this Revelation, hath failed to be quickened by its soul-stirring breeze. He is indeed a captive who hath not recognized the Supreme Redeemer, but hath suffered his soul to be bound, distressed and helpless, in the fetters of his desires.\n\nO My servants! Whoso hath tasted of this Fountain hath attained unto everlasting Life, and whoso hath refused to drink therefrom is even as the dead. Say: O ye workers of iniquity!

Today it is incumbent upon every soul to arise to remember God and serve Him. Hold fast to the Book of God and His laws, and cling to the hem of thy Lord's gracious favor. Blessed is the soul who is today adorned with the ornaments of trustworthiness, truthfulness and steadfastness. Such a one is of the people of Baha and the companions of the Crimson Ark. Blessed are they that attain!\n\nAs to thy question about power - all things have testified and do testify to the power of the Lord of earth and heaven, and the signs of His power are manifest and evident in all things. The possessors of true vision witness them at all times. Since He created the contingent world through means, therefore most matters and the manifestation of power, sovereignty, grandeur, grace and bounty have been and will be through means. All things bear witness that He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nAs for mosques, monasteries and temples that are built specifically for the remembrance of God - the mention of any other than Him is not permitted therein. This is one of the divine ordinances, and whosoever transgresseth it is accounted among the transgressors. No blame attacheth to the builder, for his work was for God and he hath attained and will attain his reward. Today what is necessary is to act according to the Most Holy Book. All must hold fast unto it and act according to what the All-Merciful hath revealed therein.\n\nAs to what you wrote about giving a sum to the King of Martyrs, the letter Ha - this is truth wherein there is no doubt, and he presented it at the Most Holy Court. All things testify to his trustworthiness, his devotion, his loftiness and his arising to serve the Cause of God.

Praise be to God that thou didst attain unto this most great bounty, for which there is no equal. Now hearken unto the call of the All-Merciful, and grieve not at separation from the Glory of the All-Glorious, and be not dismayed by the irrevocable decree of destiny. Sacrifice heart and soul in the good-pleasure of the Friend. Fix thy gaze upon the Sovereign of His Command and be severed from all else besides Him.\n\nO Hasan!

Be thou content with His command, and exchange lamentation and grief and agitation for patience and resignation. Be confident in the grace of God, for He hath never forgotten and will never forget His loved ones.\n\nThe example of thee and the emigrants is like unto a nightingale that hath long been intimate with the rose of the divine beauty in the holy paradise of the Eternal, and suddenly the hand of divine destiny separates them and pronounces the decree of divorce.

Consider the cooing of the dove and the buzzing of the fly - the former draweth the hearts of men through God's grace and guideth them to the court of the Beloved, while from the latter no effect appears nor is its purpose understood.\n\nTherefore the manifest Word of Truth must needs be uttered with clear explanation. Say: \"God is the Truth,\" then leave the people to their veils and their idle fancies. Fear thou no one but place thy trust in God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

Deprive not yourselves of the rising Sun of bounty, and forbid not yourselves the surging Ocean of grace. You have not been and are not aware of the essence of the Cause. Strive that through divine favor you may rend asunder the veils and become informed of the Dawning-Place of divine verses and the Rising-Point of His Revelation. In this dawning of days when the divine fragrance wafteth and the Call of Truth is raised amidst all beings, occupy not yourselves with the sayings of this one and that. Arise in the name of God amidst all beings, and take the chalices of recognition from the hands of the Countenance of the All-Merciful and drink therefrom in His remembrance. Justice hath ever been and shall ever be beloved in every station. We pass over all that hath appeared in this Revelation; read but a single Tablet from among the wondrous Tablets, and likewise the writings of others, and judge for yourselves. Should anyone arise with fairness, he will undoubtedly, after hearing the divine verses, instantly turn toward the realm of oneness. Blessed are the just! Blessed are they who remember! This Prisoner hath mentioned this Tablet for the sake of God, and you too should read it for the sake of God, that perchance ye may attain unto the Living Waters which flow at the heart of contingent being.

This was a bounty that was bestowed. For the house door, no funds can ever be found that could be given for business.

The carpet of sorrow was rolled up and the carpet of joy was spread forth. Before that, each day the pen would write of the pain of separation, and ink would record mention of the days of communion and unity. At times the nature yearned for the art of the nightingale, and at others beheld itself like the salamander in the fire.\n\nBrevity is more beloved than prolixity, for it neither prevents you from the mention and praise of the Beloved of the worlds, nor obscures the matter which is explained and clear to that Eminence. We have passed over lengthy discourse; in brief, without you no complete joy was attained, and your absence deprived the gatherings of their supreme adorning. As the servant was seated, suddenly from the horizon of the house your letter appeared like the morning star. After taking, reading and perusing it, it attained the honor of being heard before the face of the Lord of Names, exalted be His majesty and His favors.\n\nHe is the One Who gazeth from His most exalted horizon\n\nO My Name! Time and again have We made mention of thee. Thou hast quaffed the cup of everlasting life from the hands of the Best-Beloved of all creation. Thy mention endureth forever and thy tribulations are witnessed before the Throne. Through thy steadfastness the horizon of constancy hath been illumined and made radiant. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who loveth thee, maketh mention of thee, and hearkeneth unto thy words concerning the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\nShould you for a time turn your attention to your homeland and its environs from the land of Ya, Alif and Ra, this would be well-pleasing in the sight of God, for perchance some wayward soul might find guidance and recognize the Purpose. However, in all conditions you must fix your gaze upon the horizon of wisdom. Whatsoever is contrary to this is neither permitted nor befitting. Thus doth the Wronged One command thee and make mention of thee from this exalted station.\n\nConvey My greetings to the friends of God. Say: Beware, beware lest the clamor of the ungodly keep you back from God, the Lord of all worlds. These people newly walk in the footsteps of the people of the Furqan. By the life of God, they have not understood the Day of God, for on that Day none is mentioned save God alone. All books are dependent upon His Word and acceptance, and all deeds are contingent upon His leave. Throughout ages and centuries they have nurtured people with vain imaginings. Yet that heedless group considered themselves superior to all others, unaware that they were and are the most abject of servants. With utmost tyranny they martyred Him Whose mention they prefaced with \"may God hasten His relief.\" The result was \"may God hasten their descent into hell.\" Say: O friends of Truth! By God's life, these souls are heedless and unaware. Setting aside all else, what benefit did they derive from their past utterances that they should gain from future ones? Fie upon them and upon those who followed them without clear proof from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nIt is necessary to mention somewhat the calumnies of the Shi'ih sect and their falsehoods. O My Name! The Concourse on High lamenteth and the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise grieve, for having rent asunder the thick veils and mighty coverings, they have now returned to their first step. Weep, O people, weep! Justice hath become like the phoenix and truthfulness like equity - both unwitnessed. Yet thy Lord is the Powerful, the Mighty, the Omnipotent.\n\nThe people of Baha are deterred neither by the world nor by aught therein. His Cause is more manifest than the sun, and His call is raised at all times. Blessed is he who hath cast away the world, turning unto God, the Lord of eternity, Who in the midst of tribulation proclaimed with the most exalted call and summoned all to His luminous horizon.\n\nI know not why until now the people of the Bayan have not reflected upon the deeds and words of the previous sect. Those who considered themselves the best among mankind, namely the Shi'ih sect, committed that which caused all things to lament. Not one soul reflected upon what was the outcome of that sect and their deeds and words. By the life of our Purpose, it was all scattered dust! Now the polytheists among the people of the Bayan have established such an apparatus anew. These sightless ones have not reflected for a moment that from the beginning of the world until now, what Cause hath been greater than this Cause and what Revelation more manifest than this Revelation? Should any soul arise to deny it, to what would he then testify? Today none is mentioned save God. Blessed is the soul that hath inhaled the fragrance of this Day and recognized its Purpose. This servant beseeches the Eternal Truth to render ears worthy and eyes capable of hearkening to the Call and beholding the Supreme Horizon. Concerning what was written about His Holiness the Afnan (upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God), that he sent a telegram - the purpose thereof was that dignitary's journey to the direction of the Divine Purpose. However, the subsequent letter stated that His Holiness the Afnan (upon him be all the most glorious Glory of God) and the honored Amin (upon him be the Glory of God) had requested to proceed in those directions. After this matter was presented at the Most Holy Court, this supreme utterance shone forth from the highest horizon, He says, exalted and mighty is He: \"Now that these honored ones have made this request, the Afnan's acceptance is beloved before the Divine Presence, and if he should travel for some days in the land of Ya and its surroundings, it would be beloved.\" The people of that province and the relatives will surely attain fresh joy and new delight from meeting with that dignitary. And concerning what was written about how the friends of God in every land have all requested mention, this matter was honored to be heard. He says, exalted be His glory: \"O My Name! Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy. By My life! Whosoever has desired that his name be mentioned in the Most Holy Court, verily his mention is recorded and inscribed by the Supreme Pen. Give glad tidings from Me to all who have desired My loving-kindness and attention. Say: Verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the Answering.\" Give to each one the glad tidings of God's loving-kindness and counsel them to steadfastness and that which exalteth the station of man. Blessed are they and theirs shall be a goodly return.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about three trustworthy souls who are among the poor and working class having given a portion for the Right of God - though it is small, yet coming from its owners despite their poverty, it is most praiseworthy and beloved. These matters were presented in the presence of Him from Whose grasp nothing can escape. This is what caused the ocean of utterance to surge in the realm of possibility. He says, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nHe is the One Who speaketh in truth!\n\nO servants of the All-Merciful! My Name hath mentioned you, and We have mentioned you in a Tablet that cannot be equaled by the tablets of the world nor by what the nations possess. Your Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, beareth witness unto this. Ye have attained unto the recognition of the Wronged One, Whom the transgressors have made a prisoner because He summoned all unto God, the Lord of what was and what shall be. Bear ye witness as God hath borne witness before the creation of earth and heaven that there is no God but I, the Truth, the Knower of the unseen. Whoso hath attained unto My recognition, he is indeed of the Supreme Concourse in the sight of God, the Fashioner of the heavens and the Lord of Names; and he who hath been prevented is accounted among the heedless in the Preserved Tablet. God hath heard your call and witnessed your turning unto Him, and hath sent down for you that which shall be with you in every world of the worlds of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. Beware lest the clamor of the babblers prevent you from God, the Lord of the worlds. Preserve what ye have been given through this Name that dominateth over all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nPraise be to God, they have attained unto the bounty of the True One, exalted be His glory, and what they have given hath been accepted, and a receipt shall be sent. If possible, it would be beloved if that sum could be delivered in the land of Kha to Mulla 'Ali Bajistani (upon him be the Glory of God), that he might use half himself and deliver the other half to Ibn-i-Shahid (upon him be the Glory of God).\n\nIn reference to thy mention of His Honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad Ja'far and His Honor Aqa Mirza Mihdi, upon them be the Glory of God, this was presented before the Divine Throne and attained the honor of being heard, and the petition of His Honor Aqa Mirza Muhammad Ja'far which he had written to thy presence was likewise presented before the Throne. Two most holy and most exalted Tablets were revealed from the heaven of divine will especially for them and were sent forth. God willing, they will attain unto them and drink from their ocean of inner meanings.\n\nSimilarly, mention was made of the devout, enkindled handmaidens - the honored aunt and her two daughters, upon them be the Glory of God and His favors - and it was written that they are counted among the first believers. After these matters were presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Presence, these verses shone forth from the horizon of grace. He saith, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the All-Remembering, the All-Seeing\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My mercy. By the life of God, thou hast spoken the truth. The aunt and Khadijih in the early days attained unto faith, drank from the Kawthar of love, and received a mighty portion from the Euphrates of certitude. The sweet fragrances of the love of the All-Merciful have ever wafted from them, and they have, to the extent possible, exerted mighty efforts in service to His Cause and His loved ones. In the path of God they heard and witnessed that which caused grief to the hearts of those near unto Him. Blessed are they! By My life, all that is on earth cannot equal what hath been ordained for them. Praise be to God that they attained unto acceptance, certitude, recognition and utterance of \"yea.\" The divine testimony concerning them sufficeth and endureth. Verily, He doth not suffer the reward of the doers of good, whether men or women, to be lost. Convey to them My glad-tidings and remind them on behalf of the Wronged One. The glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My utterance be upon them and upon their children who have acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath spoken: \"Verily there is none other God but Me, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.\"\n\nTheir mention hath ever been in the Most Holy Presence, and there hath been revealed for them that which shall endure as long as the names endure. The servant beseecheth God, his Lord, to grant them success, to strengthen them, and draw them nigh unto Him. Verily, He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nLikewise, two Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Glorious Tablets were revealed and sent especially for His Honor Aqa Muhammad-'Ali and Aqa Muhammad-Husayn, upon them be the Glory of God. God willing, they will attain unto them. Some time ago their petitions attained the Most Holy Presence. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Succorer, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nRegarding thy mention of His Honor Aqa Mirza 'Abdu'r-Rahim of Qamsar, upon him be the Glory of God, and likewise the amount of six (vav) for the Huquq which His Honor Aqa Zaynu'l-'Abidin from Mazgan, upon him be the Glory of God, had sent through him - these matters were presented before His countenance. This is what was revealed for His Honor Mir, upon him be the Glory of God. He saith, exalted be His utterance:\n\nI am the Expounder, the All-Wise\n\nO Mir! Great is the Cause and great is the Day! Some followers of the Bayan have until now failed to comprehend the Day and cling to former vain imaginings. Say: O people! Today is God's Day wherein none is mentioned but Him. If a soul should be confirmed in the worship of all who have gone before and shall come after, and in less than that moment turn his gaze to aught else, he hath not been nor ever shall be accounted among the people of unity, and all his deeds shall be as scattered dust. Have they not heard the words of the people of the Furqan, that is, the Shi'ih sect, and have they not weighed the imaginings of the past? How then are they occupied in renewing suspicions and idle fancies? Nay, they are in manifest loss! Though all days of Manifestation are, in one sense, the Days of God, yet this Day was the object of the desire of all Prophets and Messengers. In all Books, Scriptures and Tablets it is adorned with the ornament of distinction. Say: Fear God, O people, and be not of them that join partners with Him! Be steadfast in the Cause, and voice the praise of thy Lord, and be firm in such wise that the edifices of doubts and idle fancies may tremble. Thus doth the Mother Book command thee.\n\nWe make mention of the friend who hath attained to the remembrance and utterance from the All-Merciful. We beseech God to aid him in that which will exalt His firm and wise Cause. Convey My greetings unto him and unto My loved ones there. We counsel them to manifest the utmost steadfastness and that which befitteth this glorious and wondrous Day. My Name, upon Him be My glory, hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee through this manifest remembrance. Thou hast attained unto thy Lord's remembrance time and again - this from His great bounty. The glory be upon you from God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nWe make mention of Zaynu'l-'Abidin who hath acted according to what was commanded in the Book of God. Blessed is the servant who hath testified to that which the Desired One hath testified, and hath performed in His path that which hath caused his remembrance to be exalted among His sincere servants.\n\nA hundred thousand thanks to the Desired One of the world! Whenever mention is made of one of His loved ones in His presence, it is adorned with the lights of His grace and embellished with the ornament of His favor. Particularly those souls whom that Excellency hath mentioned - each one hath attained unto wondrous, sublime, enduring and eternal verses. Blessed are they, and joy be unto them, and all good be unto them! This evanescent servant beseecheth all to remember him at the time of mention and praise, and to seek confirmation for him in the service of this mighty and great Cause.\n\nConcerning what was written about spending an evening at the home of Aqa Siyyid Muhammad-Baqir, upon him be the glory of God, in the company of the friends of God, engaged in the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds - this matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. His Word, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, through which the sea hath surged and the fragrance hath wafted\n\nBlessed is he whose tongue hath spoken in praise of his Lord, and he who hath inhaled the fragrance of His luminous garment, and he whose ear hath heard His sweetest call, and he whose eyes have beheld His glorious countenance. O Siyyid, O Muhammad-i-Qabl-i-Baqir! My Name, upon Him be My glory, hath made mention of thee. We make mention of thee that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful.\n\nThe greatest of all deeds in this day is steadfastness, for the people have been reared in the midst of vain imaginings. Blessed is he who hath cast aside the vain imaginings and utterances of the past and hath fixed his gaze upon the horizon of certitude alone. Those souls who are deprived of knowledge have clung to the words of the people of the Furqan and have arisen to lead others astray. This was the promise of God, exalted be His glory, and He hath given tidings in His Books of that which hath appeared and shall appear. Hold fast unto the cord of thy Lord's loving-kindness and cleave unto His luminous hem.\n\nBlessed is thy house wherein My remembrance hath been raised, and wherein My Name and My loved ones have been present. Remember them on My behalf, and convey My greetings unto them, and give them the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness and mercy. We beseech God to aid them to serve His Cause, to send down upon them blessings from His presence, and to give them to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness by the hands of His bounty. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Supreme, the Self-Subsisting.\n\nAs to what was written regarding the distress of the friends - the good of the world, the blessings of the world, and the power and might of the world, all are directed towards them and reckoned as theirs. How many companions in the time of the Seal of the Prophets, may all else but Him be sacrificed for His sake, had not even sustenance for the night, yet they held fast unto patience and were adorned with the ornament of resignation, until there was sent down unto them from the heaven of grace that which the reckoners were powerless to reckon. Soon they shall witness that which hath been revealed in the Book. The riches of the world and its good shall turn towards them from all directions. What is needed now is unity and harmony, wisdom and the teaching of the Cause in such wise as not to create commotion. This hath been and is incumbent upon the servants, and the rest is with God, exalted be His glory.\n\nDespite the expenses of this land, of which thou art aware, if any portion of the Huquq reacheth Us or arriveth, it hath been and will be given. What Ismi hath written in this regard is correct; indeed, great breaches shall appear, as they already have. Concerning the beloved Aqa Mirza Asadu'llah, upon him be the glory of God and the trust of God, what was written hath caused boundless joy. Praise be to God, and thanksgiving and glory be unto Him, and His is the power and strength and bounty. However, according to the command, at present a small place must be designated without furnishings, otherwise it is in danger. Many wicked heedless ones are to be seen; should they become aware, they may perhaps arise to commit previous deeds. At the outset of any matter its end must be considered. The place must be taken in such wise as to leave no room for anyone to make claims.\n\nAnd likewise it was written that one night they were honored to be in the house of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, together with the friends of God, upon them be the glory of God. This matter in its entirety was presented before the Presence. This is what was revealed in reply from our Lord, the Lord of the Final End. His word, exalted and mighty is He:\n\nIn My Name, Who heareth and seeth\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! For successive years thou hast been blessed with the remembrance of the Lord of Names and Attributes. Thou hast drunk from the cup of reunion and partaken of the ocean of meeting. Thou hast heard that which was mentioned in the divine Books and witnessed that which was recorded therein. Blessed art thou and blessed is thy son who hath attained unto the tablets of his Lord, the All-Bountiful. Thy mention and that of thy sons hath been immortalized in God's Book. We beseech God to aid thee in preserving that which He hath bestowed. We testify that thou didst migrate and attain Our presence, and didst hear and see. Rejoice thou in thy Lord's loving-kindness and be of them that are steadfast.\n\nWe make mention of the Hakim, brother of the Hakim, who attained Our presence and discovered the fragrance of Our wondrous Revelation. O Aqa Khan! Hearken unto the call of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, from the Divine Lote-Tree upon this elevated Mount in the most noble of spots. Verily, there is none other God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Thy mention hath been made before the Wronged One, and there hath been revealed for thee a tablet from whose horizon hath shone the star of thy Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of all men. Blessed art thou for having turned unto the Dayspring of Revelation and heard the call of Him Who conversed on Sinai, Who was promised in the Books and Tablets. We beseech God to strengthen thee, prosper thee, and ordain for thee through His Most Exalted Pen the best of this world and the next. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth, through His Name whereby He hath subdued all who are in earth and heaven. Soon shall all thou seest today perish, and there shall endure what hath been ordained by God, the Lord of Lords. We counsel thee to preserve what thou hast been given and to remain steadfast, which God hath made among the most excellent of deeds.\n\nThe waves of the ocean of bounty have encompassed all, and the lights of the Sun of loving-kindness have shone upon all. This servant beseecheth God that He may make all aware of what He desireth, for should they become aware, all would arise to serve His Cause. Praise be to God that both the aforementioned ones - namely Aqa Muhammad-'Ali and Aqa Khan, upon them be the Glory of the All-Merciful - have drunk from the cup of meeting with their heart's Desire and have attained unto that which was promised in the Books. I beseech God to strengthen them in steadfastness, which is mentioned as the most excellent of deeds, and service. I convey greetings and salutations to each, and likewise to the sons of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, upon them be the Glory of God - the eldest son and the others. Praise be to God, they are mentioned in His presence and have attained His loving-kindness. Praise be to Him in all conditions. I beseech and hope from God that He may open the door of bounty and extend the hand of giving. Verily, He hath power over all things.\n\nAs for what they wrote concerning their difficult circumstances, they were told to act in whatever way they deem advisable, whether through the Huquq or other means. They should certainly give attention to this matter. Since this is the divine will, relief shall surely come. In His grasp is the control of all affairs and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.\n\nRegarding what they wrote about the honorable Hudhud, upon her be the Glory of God, in these days news arrived of a sum of twenty tumans which has been ordered to be sent to her, with the remainder to be given to certain others. If further news arrives, it shall be transferred.\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My glory! Ha and Sin, upon him be My glory! From the beginning of the Cause he turned to the Most Exalted Horizon and in a few years was enabled to serve the Cause through mention and praise. We beseech God to strengthen him to preserve this station. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. God willing, may he be assisted to perform that which is regarded as the most excellent of all deeds in the sight of God, and which shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. O My Name! Give him the glad tidings of a favor from which the sun of permission hath dawned from the horizon of his Lord's gracious will. He may turn with such turning as causeth all created things to turn towards the precincts of nearness and meeting - the station wherein the Speaker of the Mount proclaimeth: The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nBlessed is he, for he hath attained unto that which he sought. However, as bidden, he must observe wisdom and its requirements. If circumstances are favorable, well and good; if not, patience is preferable.\n\nAs to the mention thou hast made of the feast given by the honored mother of the family, upon her be the Glory of God, and likewise the mention of the minister and his son and their circumstances, upon them be God's loving-kindness - this was presented in the Presence of Him Who was God and there was naught else besides Him. Thus did the Tongue of our Lord, the All-Merciful, speak in the Kingdom of Utterance: O My Name! We have previously made mention of Muhammad - a mention whose fragrance shall endure and persist. We beseech God to assist him to do that which beseemeth His days and enable him to act according to that which hath been revealed in the Book. From this station We send Our greetings upon him, his brother and his son. Convey to all of them the Wronged One's greetings, that the greeting may draw them to the most exalted station and bring them near unto God, the Lord of all mankind. The world is evanescent and its treasures will not endure. We beseech God to enable those who are related to attain unto true relationship and to guide them to the straight path. Praise be to God that they have been mentioned and their names have flowed from the Pen of Utterance. This is the true blessing and the heavenly food. Glory be upon them and upon those who have attained unto this manifest Day and this firm and mighty Cause.\n\nThis evanescent servant beseecheth the Eternal Truth not to deprive any of those who are related from the sealed wine.\n\nConcerning the mention thou hast made of the evening of arrival and the presence of the friends and some of the loved ones, this exalted Word hath shone forth from the Most Exalted Horizon at this point: O God! Bestow Thy blessings and peace upon the host, the guests, and those who were present, visited, attained, served, made mention and heard the praise of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nPraise be to God! These exalted words encompassed all - the host, the guests, those who were present, those who rendered service for the sake of God, and those who made their way through the snow - all attained and received their portion from the ocean of God's mention. Happy are they! Especially for the honored mother of the family, upon her be the Glory of God, a Most Holy, Most Great Tablet was revealed, and likewise specifically for the leaf who is the sister of Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon them both be the Glory of God, who made her way through snow and cold. Verily, He doth not suffer to be lost the reward of those men and women who do good.\n\nToday all the friends of God must reflect upon matters of the past and become aware of the unripe fruits of false trees, that perchance they may not fall prey to new delusions in the future. The Shi'ih sect was considered the most exalted of religions, yet it became manifest as the lowest and most abject of all parties. Some followers of the Bayan who are deprived of the rays of the Sun of Truth and barred from the ocean of knowledge walk in the footsteps of that people. The true Herald and genuine King - that blessed Being Whose mention the Shi'ih sect made for years during nights and days, eagerly awaiting His appearance and yearning for His presence - after His manifestation they all pronounced the verdict of His death and martyred Him with grievous torment. That Holy One was martyred by the sword of that group's falsehood. For one thousand two hundred years and more they busied themselves with arranging beliefs and mentioning the paths of faith and certitude. In the end neither did those beliefs bear fruit nor were those words seen to yield any result, for they were deprived of the straight path and walked the ways of idle fancies and vain imaginings. They arranged multiple partners for God, glorified be His grandeur, while considering themselves monotheists. The ultimate end of that rebellious sect was what you saw and heard. How many souls whom they considered misguided, including those of the Sunni sect, have now had the light of faith shine forth from their hearts such that they became accepted and attained His presence. Reflect upon the children of Abraham and the heirs of Moses, how they became enkindled with the fire of the Cause. Observe, then mention what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur'an, blessed and exalted be His words: \"And We desired to show favor unto those who were brought low in the land, and to make them leaders and to make them inheritors.\" Verily all grace is within His mighty grasp - He gives and withholds, and He is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.\n\nThe Supreme Pen today counsels all to steadfastness, for the croakers have appeared with evident craftiness and have striven and continue to strive to lead people astray. It is reported they have gathered the writings of this Revelation. God is aware and knowing of all intentions. We counsel all to the Most Great Steadfastness in such wise that the hearts of those who have denied God, the Lord of all worlds, may be astonished thereby.\n\nWe make mention in this station of him whom We named Khalil (Friend) in the Book. O Khalil! Hearken unto the call from the Most Exalted Horizon. Verily thy Lord hath turned toward thee and made mention of thee in such wise that nothing possessed by all the parties can equal it. Glorify thy Lord's praise and remind the people of this Cause whereby all things have proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Lords!\" Protect My servants from the calumnies of the people of the Bayan who have denied the All-Merciful by following vain imaginings and idle fancies. They desire to spread corruption in the land after its reformation. They are assuredly among the transgressors in the Scriptures and Tablets. Be a shepherd to God's flock and protect it from the wolves of the earth who have violated God's Covenant and His Testament and have committed that which caused the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise and those who circle thy Lord's throne at eventide and dawn to lament.\n\nIn My Name, the Speaker in the Kingdom of Utterance\n\nWe make mention of Abdul-Rahim, who believed in God in the beginning and the end. We have mentioned him before and We mention him at this time with verses by which the mountains would take flight. Remind the servants of what befits the days of thy Lord, then protect them from those who have denied the Resurrection.\n\nWe make mention of Our loved ones and friends in that place and its surroundings, and give them glad tidings through the remembrance of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O loved ones of the All-Merciful! We counsel you with that which will elevate your stations, and I am the True Counsellor, the All-Informed. Beware lest any matter prevent you from this Cause, or any remembrance veil you from this Great News. You are in your homes while the Most Exalted Pen makes mention of you in this firm and impregnable Prison. And We make mention of My handmaidens and give them glad tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy, which have preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth.\n\nO Ali \\[Naqi\\]! My Name, upon Him be My glory, hath made mention of thee. We have remembered thee in this Clear Tablet. Be thou thankful to God for this most great favor and say: \"Praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Goal of the mystics!\" Glory be upon Al-Khalil and upon thy father and upon thee and upon thy wife and upon My loved ones who have held fast to My firm cord. It endeth.\n\nHis is the praise and the favor at all times and under all conditions. He hath adorned His friends and loved ones with the crowns of mention and utterance. The Word of God endureth and whatsoever is therein endureth. This evanescent servant conveyeth his greetings to all the friends and loved ones, and seeketh steadfastness for all. The honored beloved one, Aqa Mir Abdul-Rahim, upon him be the Glory of God, hath been twice mentioned by the Most Exalted Pen in this letter. Blessed is he and blessed is he who hath attained unto the cup of bounty and favors. At this time, which is four and a half hours past Wednesday the 17th of Jumada'th-Thani, that which is beloved of the world was carried out by proxy for that loved one, and the word of acceptance was revealed. Blessed be your honor and this servant.\n\nThis is a Book sent down by the All-Merciful for those who have turned towards the Holy Court on a Day wherein every learned one was thunderstruck, every jurist was perturbed, and every wise one was shaken, save those whom God, the Lord of the worlds, willed otherwise. O Hashim! My Name hath mentioned thee, and We make mention of thee. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous. This is a Day wherein the Concourse on High circle round the Throne of thy Lord, the Master of humanity, yet those who claim adherence to the Bayan are among the heedless, clinging to the Calf and turning away from God, the Mighty, the Wise.\n\nO Husayn! Hearken unto the call of Husayn. He makes mention of thee and counsels thee to show forth the Greater Steadfastness in this mighty Cause. Soon will a cawer come to you with the book of the iniquitous. He is indeed among those who deny God in His Book, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. He will call you to the Calf and seeks to extinguish the light of God through the whisperings of satans. Blessed are those who remained with Us until their spirits ascended unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. The glory from Us be upon them both, and upon you, and upon those who have drunk the wine of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Ever-Flowing, the Generous.\n\nWe make mention of Muhammad, whom My Name hath mentioned, and We give him glad tidings of My loving-kindness and My mercy which have preceded all things, and of My remembrance before which all remembrances bow down. O Nasrullah! Hearken unto the call of the Wronged One, then be steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the cawing of every cawer who has disbelieved in God, the Lord of lords, will not cause thee to slip. Hold fast unto the Sure Handle and cling to the hem of thy Lord's grace, the Master of creation.\n\nWe make mention of 'Ali, who was present before My Name, with a remembrance that shall never fade. O 'Ali! Rejoice in this Most Great Remembrance, then give thanks unto thy Lord, the Master of all men. We counsel you and My loved ones there to be steadfast in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Bestowing. Whoso makes mention of this Day besides Me is among the iniquitous in the Scriptures and Tablets. This is God's Day, wherein none is mentioned save Him. To this testify those possessed of understanding, and behind them the Revealer of verses.\n\nA hundred thousand thanks must be offered in every moment, but what benefit when man is not capable of such? We are weak, we are lowly, we are poor - how can we render thanks for these successive bounties and consecutive favors? His is the praise and the favor. All the souls mentioned by that eminent one's pen have attained to that which hath no likeness or peer. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, to assist His loved ones to be steadfast, that they may not be deprived of the purpose of the world through the utterances of the whisperers and the signs of the fault-finders.\n\nAnd as for the mention made of his honor Aqa Mirza Mahmud, upon him be the glory of God, and likewise those souls who came with him from Badaghan, this matter was presented in the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court and attained the honor of being heard. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nIn My Name, the One Who ruleth over all names\n\nO Mahmud! Upon thee be My glory! Thou hast attained unto that which most of the peoples of the world, both past and present, have been deprived of despite their yearnings and aspirations. Thou hast attained unto a mention the like of which hath never been and shall never be. All divine Books bear witness unto this truth. We beseech God to set thee ablaze with the fire of His love - a fire that shall never be extinguished. O Mahmud! We counsel thee with that which will cause the exaltation of God's Cause. Today, the people of the Crimson Ark must remain so steadfast that the barking ones, the atheists, and the polytheists among the people of the Bayan shall be rendered powerless to speak. O Mahmud! For twelve hundred years the divines and pulpit-climbers led people astray, and the result of their deeds was that they pronounced their verdict against the Beloved of the world and martyred Him. And now again these same souls desire to promote their former vain imaginings. They have not reflected even briefly upon what became of that party which considered itself the most exalted of all parties. Take heed, O ye who possess insight! Blessed art thou and blessed is he who fulfilleth his covenant and breaketh not the testament of God, the Lord of the worlds. Convey My greetings unto Muhammad-i-Sadiq and give him the glad-tidings of My remembrance of him from this exalted station, that his heart may be assured through the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Most Great. We make mention of him who is named Hasan and counsel him with that which We have counselled Our loved ones before, and I am the All-Knowing Counsellor. Be thou vocal in My praise, turn thy face toward My horizon, and stand firm in My Cause whereby the limbs of the polytheists have quaked. We make mention of him who was named Ghulam-'Ali with a mention through which the sincere ones shall perceive the fragrance of their Lord's loving kindness. Beware lest the people of the Bayan, who have denied God, the Lord of the Day of Judgment, keep thee back from the All-Merciful. O Mahmud! Remind My loved ones on My behalf, then recite unto them the verses of thy Lord, and I am the All-Commanding, the All-Wise. The Glory be upon thee and upon them and upon everyone who is steadfast, firm and upright.\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi! Upon thy father and upon thee be My Baha! He spoke of My remembrance before My manifestation and knew Me before My revelation. He is among those who were mentioned in the Book of thy Lord, the All-Subduing, the Self-Subsisting. Today We enjoin steadfastness upon all, for the divines have again arisen and are preventing the servants from the Truth through their vain imaginings. Blessed is thy brother who attained unto My presence, served Me, circled round Me, hearkened unto My call, stood at My door, and gazed upon My countenance. Upon him rest the glory of God and the glory of His loved ones and chosen ones, from the beginning that hath no beginning unto the end that hearts and minds cannot reckon. We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali whom My Name mentioned in His Book, and We give him the glad-tidings of My mercy that hath preceded all who are in the heavens and on earth, and of My grace that hath encompassed all existence, both seen and unseen. Take hold of the Book of God with the strength that proceedeth from Him. He will assuredly assist thee through His grace, and He is the One Who doeth what He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nAnd this was revealed for Darab Beg, upon him be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. He is the Most Exalted, the Most Great.\n\nO Darab! Hearken unto what thy Lord, the All-Bountiful, calleth thee to in this final abode. He hath appeared and manifested what He desired, and He is the Almighty, the All-Choosing. O Darab! We counsel thee to remain steadfast in this Cause whereby feet have slipped. The clamor hath been raised and what lay hidden in hearts hath been revealed. Thy Lord is verily the Almighty, the All-Knowing. Be thou so firm in the Cause that neither the veils of men nor the pretensions of those who have disbelieved and turned away from the Most Sublime Vision shall hinder thee. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the All-Seeing. The Glory be upon thee and upon those whom the clamor of the divines hath not prevented from God, the Lord of lords.\n\nThus endeth what was revealed. There is no name but hath been honored with the verses of its Lord, and no servant but hath been sent down for him that which will draw him nigh unto God, his Lord. Happy and welcome be it to them. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, at all times, to grant steadfastness unto all, for the deceitful ones and the thieves lie in wait. God protect us and you, O ye who are brought near!\n\nAs for the mention of Aqa Muhammad-'Ali Makhmalbaf, son of Aqa Hasan, and their sons and family, upon them be the glory of God, and likewise for the sake of God, they were guaranteed their special Tablet. This detail was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Presence, and a wondrous and sublime Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the True Bestower's bounty specifically for them and was sent. God willing, may they attain unto it and drink from the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance. Likewise, mention was made of Aqa Husayn Makhmalhaf, uncle of the aforementioned person, and that group, all of them, who were written to be nearly thirty souls - all were mentioned in the Divine Presence and attained unto God's bounty. After the presentation of these exalted words, there was revealed from the heaven of grace - His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My glory! Mention on behalf of the Wronged One all those people and give them glad-tidings of God's grace, mercy and loving-kindness - namely those who have drunk from the living waters and attained unto new life. We beseech God to protect those souls from the evil of those who have turned away from the Bayan, and to keep them all firm and steadfast in His Cause. We beseech the Most High to ordain for them what He hath ordained for His chosen ones from His Most Exalted Pen, to grant them the best of what hath been revealed in His Book, and to draw them nigh unto Him in all conditions. Verily He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of all who are in the heavens and on earth.\n\nThis servant conveyeth greetings to all and declareth that there have been and are cawers, deceivers and liars. Protect yourselves from the evil of the idolatrous souls through the Name of God, exalted be His glory. In previous Tablets all have been informed about the clamor of the cawers and the atheists. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nConcerning the mention of Aqa Rama?an-'Ali who hath ascended unto God and his brother Aqa Sha'ban-'Ali, upon both of whom be the glory of God, and concerning the matter of the one tuman which was intended for a feast in honor of the beloved of the heart Haji Mirza Haydar-'Ali and other souls, upon them be the glory of God - praise and thanksgiving be unto God that before the deed manifested itself, the intention of the deceased was accepted. This is what was revealed from the Kingdom of Utterance in this station. His word, exalted and mighty is He:\n\n\"O My Name! O thou who gazest upon My countenance! We have mentioned him who hath ascended unto God with a mention which God hath made for him as the table of inner meanings and the fruit of utterance, and through it He hath ordained for him what no eye hath seen nor ear heard. Give this glad tiding to his brother who was named Sha'ban before 'Ali that he may thank his Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous. O My Name! God's favor concerning these two is clear and evident, for He aided them and caused them to attain His presence. He made them hear His call and revealed to them His beauty. Ask God that they may be aided to preserve this station.\"\n\nThis servant will also, God willing, be enabled to carry out the feast which they had intended to hold. The servant testifieth that they both attained unto the grace of their Lord, the Most High, the Great.\n\nAnd concerning what was written about being present in the house of Aqa Shukru'llah, son-in-law of Aqa Ghulam-'Ali, upon him be the glory of God, and the mention made there of a group of men and women - this matter was presented at the Most Holy and Most Exalted Court. This is what was revealed from the heaven of the knowledge of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. His word, blessed and exalted is He:\n\nO My loved ones! Hearken unto My call from the direction of My prison, then assist the Wronged One through goodly deeds, praiseworthy character, and wondrous, sublime steadfastness. He commandeth you what profiteth you, and He is the Truthful, the Trustworthy.\n\nO Shukru'llah! My Name mentioned thee, so We make mention of thee as a grace from Us, and I am the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Hold fast unto the cord of steadfastness, turning away from those who have disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds. Glory be upon thee, upon thy wife and her mother, from One Who is All-Knowing, All-Informed.\n\nO Ghulam-'Ali! We have mentioned thee before with verses that nothing in creation can equal, thy Lord, the All-Knowing, beareth witness to this. Be thou steadfast in serving the Cause, speaking the praise of thy Lord, and gazing toward His luminous horizon. Thou hast attained unto the utterance of the All-Merciful time and again, to this My Most Exalted Pen beareth witness, and it is My Self, the One that encompasseth all who are in the heavens and on earth. We make mention of thy son Mahdi and give him glad tidings of My grace and bounty, and We counsel him with that which beseemeth My mighty, wondrous Cause.\n\nO Mahdi! Upon thee and upon thy father be My Glory, My mercy and My grace that cannot be equalled by the riches of kings and monarchs.\n\nO Shaykh Qabli-Hasan! Thou art among those who have attained unto My remembrance, both before and after, and unto My verses from which those near unto God inhale the fragrance of My wondrous raiment. We have heard thy mention from a Book bearing My Most Great Name, and We make mention of thee from this remote spot. Convey My greetings unto My loved ones. We counsel them to manifest supreme steadfastness in this mighty Cause. We make mention of Muhammad-Qabli-Tahir, that he may rejoice in the bounty of his Lord and be of them that render thanks. Blessed art thou and blessed are My friends who have quaffed the living waters of steadfastness from the hands of the bounty of their Lord, the Generous, the Benevolent. Blessed is thy father who attained unto the Ocean of Life when it surged forth from the presence of the All-Bountiful, the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Wise. Glory be upon thee and upon all who are with thee, both men and women, who have acknowledged that which God, the Lord of this wondrous Day, hath acknowledged.\n\nThis evanescent servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to Jinab-i-Aqa Ghulam-'Ali, upon him be the Glory of God, and to the souls mentioned, and counseleth all to steadfastness, for the polytheists among the people of the Bayan, through the vain imaginings of the people of the Furqan, have striven and continue to strive with the utmost hypocrisy to lead astray the loved ones of the All-Merciful. Today steadfastness is accounted as the most great of all deeds in the presence of the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed is he who hath attained thereunto and quaffed its pure wine, and woe unto him who hath denied and forsaken it.\n\nAs to the mention made of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-'Ali, brother of Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Riday-i-Muhajir, upon them both be the Glory of God, and the supplication he sent to the Most Holy Court, this evanescent one presented these details and his supplication was, according to His command, honored to be heard in His presence. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nHe is the Hearer from the Most Exalted Horizon\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali! My Name hath made mention of thee and hath received thy supplication and that wherewith thou didst call upon God, the Lord of the worlds. The servant present before the Countenance read it. We heard and have responded through this perspicuous Tablet. Say:\n\nGlorified art Thou, O my Lord, the Most Merciful! I beseech Thee by the waves of the ocean of Thy utterance, the manifestations of Thy Lordship, the revelations of Thy Divinity, and the mysteries that were hidden in Thy knowledge, to aid me in serving Thee and serving Thy loved ones, and to enable me to fulfill the rights Thou hast revealed in Thy Book. O Lord! I am he who hath turned unto Thy most exalted horizon and clung to the hem of Thy bounty, O Lord of all being and King of the kingdom of names. I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what is with Thee nor to deny me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. I implore Thee, O God of names and Creator of heaven, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause in such wise that neither the ornaments of the world nor the clamor of the wicked ones who have arisen to mislead Thy creatures in Thy days shall hinder me. Then ordain for me, O my Best-Beloved, the good of this world and the world to come. Verily, Thou art the Almighty to do what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.\n\nPraised and glorified be He! He hath revealed for him whom your presence hath mentioned that which no earthly thing can equal, to this our Lord, the Creator of heaven, beareth witness. During its revelation the tongue of grandeur spoke this exalted word, exalted be His utterance: \"O My Name! Souls have appeared with perfect love and ardor, and God Himself is witness and testifier - verily He heareth and seeth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\" Ask ye of God that they may be assisted to perform such deeds as are recorded and inscribed in the divine Book by the Most Exalted Pen. O My Name! God willing, may all be enabled to discharge the rights. Although these rights pertain to the Right Itself, yet your honor knoweth how many souls are today engaged in service to the Cause in various regions, while their affairs are apparently hindered. Since matters ordained by God have been made dependent upon means, therefore the law of payment of rights hath been sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will, and the benefit of this deed returneth unto those who practice it.\n\nThis servant beseecheth God, exalted be His glory, beseeching Him to assist His loved ones to perform such deeds as shall endure and be preserved in His presence.\n\nConcerning the mention which you made of Mirza 'Abbas, upon him be the glory of God, who is counted among this servant's relatives, and likewise concerning his expressions of love and affection for this servant - although today all relationships are severed, all paths are forbidden, and all ways are blocked, yet since the mercy of the Desired One of all worlds hath taken precedence, therefore this weak ant entreateth God, exalted be His glory, and with utmost humility and supplication beseecheth that He may assist him, namely Aqa Mirza 'Abbas, to that which is befitting, and that He may mention him in the Book by the Most Exalted Pen as among the souls who are firm, steadfast and upright. Indeed, mention of him was made in the Most Holy Court and attained the honor of being heard. Blessed and exalted be His word:\n\nHe is the All-Witnessing, the All-Informed\n\nO 'Abbas! Reflect upon the former centuries. Consider what hath come to pass in ages past, that thou mayest find the straight path and recognize the way of truth. Ponder upon \"There came not unto them a Messenger but they did mock at him.\" By My life! If those who hesitate, turn away and deny would reflect upon this one verse that hath been mentioned, all would turn unto the truth and would regard the opposition and objection of the divines of the earth as proof of the truth of Him Who calleth today. We beseech God that He may assist thee and not deprive thee from the lights of His countenance, that thou mayest attain unto that which all the Books and Messengers have testified to and for which they have sought His presence. O 'Abbas! Hearken unto My call. Say: God! Then leave them to their vain disputes. Turn with a luminous face toward the horizon of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.\n\nA hundred thousand thanks unto the true Object of worship and the true Bestower Who at every moment granteth that which tongues of the world are powerless and incapable to mention. We hope that he may attain unto the divine verses and drink from the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance and receive his portion from the fragrance of the words of Him Who revealeth the verses. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer. This servant conveyeth greetings and glorification unto him, and at every moment seeketh divine confirmation for him and all his relatives. Verily He hath power over all things and is worthy to answer prayers.\n\nMention was made of Jinab-i-Aqa Siyyid Isma'il, upon him be the Glory of God, and the Sun of Permission hath once again risen from the horizon of grace - blessed be he! Concerning the mention that was made of Jinab-i-Aqa 'Ali-Akbar, the harness maker, and Jinab-i-Aqa Muhammad-Ibrahim, the handkerchief weaver, upon them be the Glory of God, that they are among the righteous ones, both pious and attentive to serving the loved ones - all these matters were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted Threshold. This is what was revealed in response from our Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. He - exalted and glorified be He - speaketh the truth:\n\nO My Name Mahdi! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. This Wronged One arose to establish the Cause in days when darkness had encompassed the world. None dared breathe a word. The atheists and hypocrites lurked behind veils, fleeing from place to place to preserve their lives. After countless afflictions and the revelation of verses morning and evening, when the world became somewhat illumined by the lights of the Sun of Manifestation and a measure of tranquility was attained, they emerged from behind their veils and initiated a new game of religious pretense. Thou knowest well with what mercy the Supreme Pen hath been engaged night and day, and with what loving-kindness it hath been made manifest. Nevertheless, several souls from Kaf and Ra, who were and are unworthy of mention, have raised the standard of corruption and appeared with utmost deceit and guile. Some through the pulpit and others through letters and messages strive to lead the servants astray. May God destroy them! The same apparatus of the people of the Furqan has emerged - that is, the vain imaginings of the Shi'ih faction. They utter that which was never and is not with God, exalted be His glory. A Manifestation which from the beginning until now has appeared with utmost power amidst enemies, has not concealed itself for a moment, and from which has been revealed and made manifest the equivalent of what was revealed by all the Prophets and Messengers, and all future events have been explicitly recorded in Tablets by the Supreme Pen - yet they have said that which was never said and which no idolator has ever uttered. Strange it is that some of the souls who had accepted the Faith have hesitated and some have turned away. Glory be to God! They are occupied with the buzzing of a fly and are heedless of the Lord of Lords. Fie upon them and upon those who have denied God and His verses and have disputed His proof! In such circumstances the Supreme Pen has had and has no inclination to make mention in these days. In Iraq was seen in a vision that which would cause every person of insight and heart to weep and lament. If it be before thine eyes, thou wilt become aware of what has happened and what will come to pass. In any case, We beseech God to make those souls whom thou hast mentioned aware and to adorn them with the ornament of steadfastness.\n\nO My Name! We make mention in this station of him whom thou didst mention and who was named 'Ali-Akbar, that he may hold fast to the cord of his Lord's loving-kindness, the Lord of Power, and may testify to that which God hath testified, that there is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O 'Ali-before-Akbar! When thou dost inhale the sweet fragrances of thy Lord's utterance, arise and say:\n\nO my God, my Lord and my Goal! I beseech Thee by the horizon of Thy Manifestation, by the ocean of Thy knowledge and the sun of Thy Cause, to aid me to be steadfast in Thy love. O Lord! Thou seest how the embodiments of vain imaginings are calling Thy servants unto idols. I implore Thee to protect me and Thy servants from the evil of these ones, then banish them by Thy power, O Thou Who art the Possessor of Names and the Sovereign of earth and heaven. O Lord! I am the poor one who seeketh Thy grace, Thy mercy and Thy generosity. Disappoint me not, O my God, from that which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book of the wonders of Thy favors and bounties. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over whatsoever Thou willest, and Thou art the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful.\n\nWe make mention of him who is named Muhammad-Ibrahim and give him the glad-tidings of My mercy which hath preceded all who are in the heavens and the earth. O Ibrahim! The perishing ones have made claims of being, and the misguided ones have made claims of faith. Beseech God to protect thee. The Cause is most mighty. Reflect upon the leaders of the people, how they all issued decrees and martyred the Beloved of the world. Now they have appeared in the Bayan, having opened the gates of fancy and vain imaginings. We beseech God to protect thee and those who have believed from the evil of these ones, and to grant you the good of the hereafter and of this world, and to give you to drink from the Kawthar of steadfastness from the hands of grace and bounty. Verily He is the Omnipotent over what He willeth. There is none other God but He, the Counselor, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nAnd concerning the mention of Aqa Siyyid Husayn-i-?abbagh and Ustad Nasru'llah-i-Najjar, upon them be the glory of God, after being submitted before the Most Great Threshold, these supreme verses were revealed from the Source of Names. His word, exalted be His glory:\n\nWe are the Wronged One, the Stranger.\n\nO Siyyid before Husayn! The Dawning-Place of revelation, the Dayspring of manifestation, the Source of the Cause and the Manifestation of the Divine Self hath appeared. Nevertheless, the ignorant and heedless people... while the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge have filled the world, equivalent to all books before and after, nay more, have been sent down from the heaven of Will. Nevertheless, the idolaters strive and endeavor to reject it. One must take refuge in God, for again the turbaned ones have turned their thoughts to pulpit and prayer-niche, and have not ceased nor do they cease in leading people astray. Seek protection from God and ask for steadfastness, that ye may remain preserved from the evil of the atheistic, idolatrous souls. We counsel thee to pure deeds and to that which We have revealed in the Psalms and Tablets. Praise the Beloved of the world Who aided thee and made thee aware. Verily thy Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Generous. Say: Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\nAnd this is what was revealed for Ustad Nasru'llah, upon him be \\[the glory of God\\]:\n\nHe is the Near One, the Answerer.\n\nGlorified be He Who hath appeared and manifested that which was hidden in knowledge and inscribed in the books of God, the Lord of the worlds. Verily He hath come with the banners of verses and hath arisen with the Cause in such wise that neither the doubts of the divines nor the might of the heedless could hold Him back. O Nasru'llah! God hath assisted thee, for thou wert aided to recognize the Dawning-Place of revelation and the Dayspring of inspiration in days when all were found to be heedless and veiled except whom God, the Lord of the worlds, did will. Know thou the value of this station and preserve it from the deniers among the people of the Bayan. By the life of God! They are in manifest ignorance. Seek steadfastness from God in such wise that the idolaters shall have no power to speak. Thus doth command thee He in Whose possession is the perspicuous Book.\n\nO My friends, upon you be My Glory! The Wronged One mentions you in His prison and gives you glad tidings of God's loving-kindness, the Lord of all beings. O Rajab, when My name was mentioned in your remembrance, We remembered you, and verily it is the Lamp of God that walks before your face in the realms of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. This is a station which God has made contingent upon the Most Great Steadfastness. Blessed is he who attains unto it, and woe betide every heedless doubter. Hold fast unto the cord of the Cause and cling to the hem of the loving-kindness of your Lord, the Master of all necks.\n\nO Husayn, the Wronged One remembers you when sorrows encompassed Him from those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of Religions. The people believed in the Pool but denied the Most Great Ocean. Thus did their souls entice them. They are assuredly among the companions of the fire. They claim to believe in God's Messengers of old and in Him Who came with the truth, yet they denied their Messenger, their Manifestation, and their Helper. Verily your Lord is the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Guard yourself against those who believe according to their desires and disbelieve in God, the Lord of Lords.\n\nO Muhammad, hearken unto that for which ears were created, then give thanks to your Lord, the Master of the Final Return. We have sent down the verses, and beyond them We have manifested the clear proofs, and beyond them We were visibly resplendent before the faces of the enemies in days wherein the limbs of the people of the Bayan trembled - they who have today emerged from behind the veil. Say: Fear God, O people! Shatter the idol of fancy, then turn with radiant faces toward the Supreme Horizon, the station wherein the Divine Lote-Tree calls out: \"The Kingdom belongs to God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Chosen One!\"\n\nO Muhammad-Taqi, sanctify your ears from hearkening to the call of the opposers and purify your tongue from the mention of the deniers. Eyes were created for the Greatest Vision and ears for hearkening to the call of the Lord of Destiny. O Dyer, God willing, you shall attain to the divine coloring and shall desire no other hue. In truth I say, thieves lie in ambush that they might find some weak one and seize upon him. Guard yourself in the name of Truth. This is the Wronged One's counsel to you and the friends. We heard your mention and made mention of you. Give thanks to your Lord for this manifest bounty.\n\nO Muhammad-'Ali, all the Prophets and Messengers gave the people glad tidings of this Revelation and informed them of this Day. God has adorned His Books and His Scriptures with this Name through which, when it appeared, the idols fell and the traces of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of the worlds, were effaced. Now certain wood-turners are sullying the wings of the faithful with the clay of idle fancies and preventing them from flight. Guard your wings from the clay of these people, then thank your Lord, the Generous. Verily He has aided you, caused you to know Him, made you to hear, and guided you to His Straight Path.\n\nO My Name! Upon thee be My Glory and My loving-kindness! Convey My greetings to all the loved ones of God and give them glad tidings of the grace of God, exalted be His Glory. Counsel them in that which is the cause of deliverance and success. All the companions in that land have been and are oppressed, having borne tribulations in the path of God. The deeds of all are remembered with God and are recorded by the Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Book. Not a soul's reward, even to the extent of a mustard seed, has been or ever shall be lost. We beseech God to strengthen all to remain steadfast. Verily, He is powerful over all things. The Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of My mercy be upon thee and upon them and upon those whom the clamor hath not prevented from the Most Exalted Horizon, who have arisen and proclaimed: \"God is our Lord and the Lord of the Mighty Throne.\" Praise be to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nThis servant conveyeth greetings and salutations to that honored one and to the friends of God who have quaffed from the sealed wine and who are holding fast unto the Self-Subsisting Lord. He declareth his own evanescence and nothingness, and beseecheth that honored one not to forget him and to pray to God for divine confirmation, that perchance he may not fall short in service and may attain unto God's good-pleasure. May remembrance and praise and glory and light be upon your honor and upon those who are with you and upon those who love you and hearken to your words.\n\nAt this point, mention was made of the spiritual friends, his honor Shaykh Abu'l-Qasim and his honor Aqa Mirza Aqa, upon them be 96 \\[Baha'u'llah\\]. God knoweth that the mention of these two beloved ones that appeared in the blessed Writing was presented day and night, and their names flowed from the tongue of the Desired One. Blessed are they, and again blessed are they. This servant is certain they have not been forgotten for a moment, as if they were present before the servant. I beseech God, exalted be His Glory, to strengthen them in that which would delight their eyes and gladden their hearts and elevate their stations and manifest what He hath ordained for them. God willing, may they be assisted in that which is befitting and may they attain true unity and harmony. Verily our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Answerer, and He is the Near One, the Watchful.\n\n=== END BH02753 ===\n\n=== START BH02754 ===\n\nO Muhammad, upon whom be the Glory of God! He is God, exalted be His station in wisdom and utterance! Say to the divines on behalf of Baha: According to your claim, We are at fault. Why did you turn away from the Seal of the Prophets? What error appeared from the Spirit? What crime was manifest from Moses? Be fair, by God, and be not among the wrongdoers! If you say \"We were not present in that age,\" We say that those who arose to revile, curse, turn away and object were like unto you. The divines of Egypt objected to Moses, the divines of the Torah and the idolaters to the Spirit, and the divines of the idols, the Gospel and the Torah to the Seal of the Prophets, bringing forth that which caused the Mother Book to lament. The divines of every age have ever forbidden people from turning to God and commanded them to turn away. Were you to reflect even less than that, you would testify to what hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. Say: O concourse of divines! The path is clear, the proof manifest, the Book revealed and the Tree raised up. Fear God, glorified be His majesty, and act according to that which ye are bidden. Deny not the grace of God and deprive not the luminary of justice of light. By the life of God! This Day hath no peer or likeness. Cast aside idle fancies and turn to the horizon of certitude. Today there is no refuge or shelter for anyone except God alone. Say: O concourse of the ignorant! Soon shall ye witness that which hath flowed from the Most Exalted Pen. This is the truth, there is no doubt about it. We beseech God, exalted be His glory, not to deprive His servants of the ocean of His bounty. He is the Powerful, the Mighty. The Glory from Us be upon thee and upon those whom nothing whatsoever hath prevented from God, the Creator of the heavens and the Lord of Names. Wisdom hath forbidden Us to reveal to the divines. We have revealed and said what must be said. If the world should say it beareth no fruit and leaveth no trace, it increaseth naught for the wrongdoers save loss. \\[The final paragraph of the blessed Tablet is written on a separate sheet and attached to the Tablet sheet. It may be written after the above blessed Tablet or may have been revealed separately.\\]\n\n=== END BH02754 ===\n\n=== START BH02755 ===\n\nIn the Name of Him through Whom the ocean of true understanding has surged in creation!

Upon thee be My glory, My loving-kindness and My mercy, which have preceded existence both seen and unseen. Reflect upon the tribulations of the Wronged One. A soul whom We sheltered for years beneath the canopies of grandeur and the shade of the Tree of loving providence has risen up in such opposition as hath neither precedent nor equal. By order of the King of Iran We proceeded to Iraq. After some time Our brother arrived there, and later, by decree of the Sublime State, We proceeded to the Land of Mystery. We observed that he had gone to Mosul and was awaiting Our arrival. Wherever We went, he came also. Later it became known that he had written to Hadi of Dawlat-Abad denying his own journeys and presence. Glory be to God! He had suffered not a single blow in this Cause. Now he has united with one like unto himself, Shaykh Muhammad, and likewise with the son of Mulla Ja'far and Aqa Khan and two others, and every day they cling to new calumnies. Praise be to God Who hath revealed that which was hidden, that the manifestations of justice and fairness might become aware. Yet the Wronged One remaineth established in a Cause that all the hosts of earth and heaven cannot withstand, and uttereth His word with a power that the ranks of enemies cannot weaken.\n\nWe beseech God to aid thee to achieve that which befitteth His Day. O My Afnan! Be not grieved at what hath come to pass. Occupy thyself with teaching the Cause with spirit and fragrance, with wisdom and utterance. This beseemeth thy station, and God is witness to what I say.\n\nThe Most Great Branch, upon him be the glory of God, hath mentioned thee repeatedly. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to ordain for him and for thee that which shall endure as long as His kingdom, His dominion, His might and His sovereignty endure.

Verily this is a revelation whereof every person of innate knowledge beareth witness that it hath been sent down from One Who is mighty and wise. They that have disbelieved - these shall not find therein the fragrances of the All-Merciful. Nay, they are in manifest error, even as those before them found not, on the day when the Manifestation of Mine own Self, the Most High, the All-Wise, appeared among them. They said: \"This hath not been sent down from innate knowledge,\" after that innate knowledge was itself created therefrom. Thus do We recount unto you that which hath been ordained, and thy Lord best knoweth the idolaters. Say: O people! Fear ye God, and utter not that which causeth the dwellers of the realms of eternity to lament and the pillars of the mighty Throne to tremble. Every person of innate knowledge hath been created by His command, if ye be of them that know. And every person of insight recognized the truth before its manifestation - how much more after its manifestation through a perspicuous Book! And no one possessed of a heart would exchange a single letter of God's words for all the treasures of the heavens and earth. Say: O people! Fear ye God and take not any partner unto Him. Verily He was ever One in His Essence. He hath created all contingent things through the Word whereon He shed the light of His name, the Creator. Blessed be God, the best of creators! Say: All are His servants and make mention of Him by night and by day, yet most of them are behind a mighty veil. God hath accepted the deeds of them that have turned unto Him, for He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful. As to them that have turned away - their deeds shall not be accepted, even should they worship Him throughout the duration of the kingdom of earth and heaven. This is a certain truth. Had God accepted the deeds of those who in times past were among the people of the Torah and the Gospel, He would surely accept the deeds of these people. Thus hath the matter been decreed by One Who is knowing and wise. Leave the people to their vain imaginings, then take thou for thyself a path unto God. They that have turned away from this Countenance - these are deprived of God's grace and mercy, and are recorded as being among the people of error by the Pen of Glory in the Tablet. Shun them, and turn with thy whole being unto Him at Whose bidding the Sun of Justice hath shone forth from the horizon of this heaven which hath been raised up in God's name. Thus have We cast upon thee the word of truth and ordained for thee the way of guidance, that thou mayest give thanks unto thy Lord, Who is indeed aware of His servants.

We have made thee one of Our Most Beautiful Names that thou mayest summon the people unto thy Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious. Thus hath the Sun of Wisdom shone forth from the horizon of thy Lord's Will, the Mighty, the All-Choosing. None hath the right to object to thee; rather must every soul follow that which thou hast been commanded in the Tablets.

Gather the people on the shore of the Most Great Ocean. Say: O people! Fear God and follow not every doubtful idolater. Soon shall the world and all that ye behold today perish, and the throes of death shall overtake you. Then shall ye find no escape, save for him in whose heart is the love of God. His face shall be illumined in that hour and he shall see at his right hand the angels of Paradise with goblets and cups. He shall drink from their hands the Water of Life and his spirit shall ascend to the highest horizon.

These hosts, in the first station and primary rank, have been and shall ever be the verses of God. He is the triumphant, He is the All-Compelling, He is the All-Encompassing. His revelation is manifest and evident in the horizons and in the souls, yet in every station it appeareth according to measure and degree. None save those possessed of penetrating vision, pure souls and illumined hearts can truly comprehend it as befitteth its station. And in one station the hosts of Truth are the Hands of His Cause, that is, those souls who arise for the sake of God to educate the peoples and reform the world, who make the inhabitants of earth aware through wisdom and utterance and guide them to the supreme horizon. And in one station, goodly deeds and praiseworthy conduct have been and shall ever be the hosts of God. Thus in this most great Revelation We have commanded all to triumph through the fear of God and to adorn the world with the ornament of security and tranquility. The outward hosts and armies belong unto the kings - they are the manifestations of divine power. If they enter beneath the shade of the pavilions of grandeur they are ascribed unto the Truth; otherwise the command is His - He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. In this Revelation the host that hath arisen to serve is the Pen of the Ancient King. Through it the standard of triumph hath been raised and the banner of victory hath been unfurled. It moveth by night and by day with a motion that hath stirred all created things. It is the horseman that raceth in the arena of wisdom and utterance. Its power is not weakened by the might of the world, and its purpose is not hindered by the desires of the nations. It is the prevailing one, it is the triumphant one. Glory be unto God! In the divine days the vanquished is beheld as the victor. Blessed are they that ponder, blessed are they that perceive, and blessed are they that attain. And He hath hosts and armies that none knoweth save His own Self. These hosts are not seen with outward eyes. His is the command in all circumstances, and His is the decree in the beginning and in the end. O thou who gazest! He Who is mentioned and Who converseth from the Sinai of Utterance speaketh these exalted words, that they may draw thee to the horizon of detachment and bring thee near unto the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.

And We make mention of him who was named 'Abbas that he may rejoice and be of the thankful. Blessed is he who hath attained unto My remembrance and spoken that which My tongue hath testified to and circled round My wondrous Cause. Rejoice, O My loved ones, in what hath been sent down to you from the Most Exalted Pen that whereby the hearts of the mystics are gladdened.

Thou hast expressed grief. This is the Day which in all the Scriptures, Books and Tablets is rightly attributed to God and mentioned as the Day of God. The Most Great Joy standeth manifest and visible before the face of the world. Reflect upon the stories of old, that perplexity may be transformed into certitude and the sun of assurance may shine forth from the horizon of the heaven of thy heart. Whatsoever hath occurred in the world was revealed with utmost clarity from the Supreme Pen. If thou wouldst observe, thou wouldst become somewhat aware of the all-encompassing knowledge of God. In every age and epoch, when the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree was heard and the fragrance of the Revelation was diffused, the divines of the age arose to deny and denounce. They are learned in the eyes of men but ignorant before thy Lord, the All-Knowing. It is not known in what wilderness these ignorant souls walk or toward what visage they turn. They adduce proof of their own truth from a mere drop while remaining heedless and turning away from the ocean of verses. If they look to knowledge, its sun is manifest and evident from the horizons of divine Tablets in such wise that none hath any way to deny or object. And if they look to verses, these have encompassed East and West. In the Tablet of Proof these two verses were sent down from the heaven of the will of the All-Merciful. Blessed is he who readeth them and findeth the sweetness of the utterance of his Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. We said: \"Dost thou object to Him Who hath brought thee what thou possessest and what the people of the world possess of God's proofs and His signs? Open thy vision that thou mayest behold the Wronged One dawning from the horizon of God's will, the King, the Truth, the Manifest.\" And in another place: \"Dost thou deny the verses of thy Lord which, when sent down from the heaven of the Command, caused all the Books of the world to bow before them? Thus did the Tongue speak in the kingdom of utterance, yet most of the people are heedless.\" The souls that are firm, steadfast, established and assured must become illumined by the lights of the Sun of divine utterance and give light to the world. It behooveth him who hath attained unto this Tablet to render thanks unto his Lord, the Speaker, the All-Knowing. Thus hath the sun of grace shone forth and illumined the horizon of the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of the worlds.\n\n=== END BH02770 ===\n\n=== START BH02771 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted!

We have indeed found the fragrance of thy love for thy Lord; therefore have We sent down to thee clear verses whereby the eyes of those near unto God have been solaced, that the verses of thy Lord may attract thee in such wise that thou mayest hear from all things: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the All-Praised.\" Remember thy Lord in thy days - this is the best of all deeds before thy Lord, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Say: O people! The Beloved hath come and the horizons are illumined. Why do I see you among the heedless? Doth it beseem anyone to seek the pond and turn away from the Kawthar and Salsabil? Nay, by my Lord! This beseemeth you not, were ye of them who know. Say: The pond representeth your vain desires, while the ocean speaketh the truth. Hasten with your hearts and follow not every remote polytheist. Blessed art thou for having tasted the pure wine which hath flowed from the direction of the Most Great Scene, and for having attained unto a station wherein He Who possesseth all destiny remembereth thee in the prison - He through Whom the divine fragrance wafted throughout all creation and every wise decree was made manifest. Say: O people of the Bayan! Fear God and follow not him whom ye know not. Follow the path of God - this indeed is the straight path. Give thanks unto thy Lord for having attained and turned toward the Wronged One in days when He was in the prison of the polytheists. Be thou steadfast in the Cause in such wise that the winds that blow from the hearts of the heedless cannot move thee. They whisper in the breasts of men even as the Evil One whispered aforetime, whose mention was sent down in a clear Book. We see nothing greater than steadfastness in God's Cause. Hold thou fast unto it through thy Lord's sovereign might, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. We beseech God to assist thee in all conditions and to strengthen thee among His servants through His remembrance and praise. He is the Protector of those who remember Him. Trust in Him in all matters. He, verily, will help those who help Him. He is indeed the Strong, the Mighty, the Powerful. We have heard thy call in remembrance of thy Lord and have answered thee with this exalted Tablet. When the wine of thy Lord's verses intoxicates thee, turn thy face toward the holy court and say: Praise be to Thee, O God of the worlds! Verily, all glory be upon Thee and upon those who have heard the call of their Lord from this Scene wherein the Temple of the Cause is established upon a mighty throne.\n\n=== END BH02771 ===\n\n=== START BH02772 ===\n\nIn My Name which shineth forth from the horizon of creation.

Thus hath the Most Exalted Pen spoken upon the branches of the uttermost Lote-Tree. Blessed are they that hear. Take hold of the Book of God with the power that proceedeth from Him, adhering to the wisdom which hath been sent down from God, the Lord of the worlds. None should acknowledge that which he possesseth, for the protection of those who have turned towards the Countenance - a command from the presence of One mighty and powerful. The servant who was present brought thy letter and placed it before the Face, and there hath been revealed for thee this wondrous and glorious Tablet. Give thanks unto God for having enabled thee to turn towards Him and guided thee unto His straight path, from which the servants have turned aside except such as God hath willed, the Possessor of this mighty and exalted Cause. He hath, of His grace, forgiven thee and thy father and mother. Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Beseech God to assist thee in that which beseemeth His days and this Cause, whereby the limbs of them that denied God's right and His sovereignty did quake, and who disputed His signs, and turned away from His luminous countenance. At this moment We make mention of the handmaiden whom thou didst mention in thy letter, and give her the glad-tidings of her Lord's loving-kindness. We make mention too of her daughter and of those women who have believed in God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We make mention of thine uncle who turned towards the Most Sublime Horizon on a day whereon the limbs of the servants trembled for fear of the Cause, save those who held fast to the cord of God, the All-Powerful. We had mentioned her aforetime with that which nothing in all creation can equal, and at this hour with a mention whereby the hearts of them that are endued with understanding are attracted. We make mention of God's loved ones in that land, whom the circumstances of the tyrannous ones did not frighten, and whom the power of those who disbelieved in the Day of Judgment did not weaken. O concourse of loved ones! Conceal the pearls of divine knowledge from the eyes of the treacherous ones. None should acknowledge the Cause of God before the faces of those through whose tyranny the dwellers of the Most Exalted Paradise did lament, and every perceiving mystic did cry out. The glory be upon you, O My loved ones, and upon you, O My handmaidens. Know ye of a certainty that soon shall perish that wherein the oppressors take pride, and there shall endure for you that which hath been ordained by the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

Thy letter hath come before the Face and the servant present before the Throne hath read it. We have answered thee with that whereby bodies have taken flight and the eyes of those near unto God have been solaced. We have found from thy letter the fragrance of thy sincerity to God and thy turning toward His face after the passing of all things. Verily thy Lord is the Hearing, the Seeing. And We found it sanctified from mention of aught else. Thus it behooveth one who hath turned today unto Him Who was promised in the Qur'an on the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds. Blessed art thou and blessed is he who guided and directed thee to the straight path of God. How many a learned one heard the call when it was raised between earth and heaven, yet attained not to the word \"yea,\" and was recorded among the most lost in the perspicuous Book. But thou didst turn and advance and hear and answer thy Ancient Lord. Give thanks unto God for this most great favor. He confirmeth whom He willeth through a command from His presence, and He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Wise. Counsel the servants on My behalf to righteousness and piety, to trustworthiness and godliness, and to that whereby the Word of God is exalted amongst men. Verily thy Lord is the Counselor, the Compassionate, the Generous. Say: O people, abandon what ye possess of idle fancies. The Hidden Name hath appeared and calleth out with the most exalted call from the supreme horizon, summoning those in the kingdom of creation unto God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Beware lest ye deprive yourselves of the Most Great Ocean. Fear God and be not of the heedless. Open your eyes - verily the Sun is at its zenith. Hold fast unto it and be not of the wrongdoers. Soon shall perish what ye and your divines and princes possess, and the Cause shall remain with God, the Lord of the worlds. Thus have the spheres of utterance revolved by the finger of the All-Merciful, and the river of mercy hath flowed through this Most Great Name. Joyous are they who have attained and seen and drunk, and woe unto them that have turned away.

A detailed petition was also sent previously which God willing has reached the luminous presence. I place my trust in God and through Him shall be elevated. Regarding what you had written about sending multiple letters - all were received. And regarding those souls who attained the presence of your honor and the Land of Ta and elsewhere, whose names you had mentioned - all were presented at the Most Holy, Most Exalted, Most Mighty Court and Tablets were specifically revealed and sent for all. Praise be to God, the divine favors are manifestly evident in utmost brilliance and appearance. Regarding what was written about the discord in the Land of Qaf, this servant is bewildered as to what souls are maintaining discord, when any person of understanding perceives this much - that discord is the cause of wasting the Cause of God and the reason for the abasement of the loved ones. We beseech God to make known to them what befits them in these days and benefits them in the hereafter and the former life. It seems some have made discord a change of taste. God willing, we hope that all will rend asunder the veils and unite in perfect fellowship and harmony upon the Divine Word. And regarding what you had written about not falling short in teaching the Cause of God to the extent possible in every place and station - it is evident that from one such as your honor there has not been and will not be any neglect in proclaiming the Cause of God and serving the Cause. God willing, utmost effort must be exerted in removing discord between the loved ones and acting with wisdom, so that all the divine friends may be enabled and adorned with the ornament of fellowship and wise action. And regarding what was written about the Siyyid, upon him be what is upon him - it is evident to all: for every light there is darkness. God will soon seize him with a mighty force from His presence and prevent him from what he intended and make him a lesson to observers. All those circumambulating send greetings. By thy life!

Yet after all this, and after Thou didst honor him through Thy generosity and favor him through Thy beneficence, he remained heedless of rendering thanks to Thee and negligent of the beauty of the glory of Thy sovereignty, to such extent that he turned not to the most exalted cities beneath the shadow of Thy most exalted Name. And he remained thus until his days reached the end Thou hadst ordained for him, whereupon his tongue grew heavy and his eyes grew dim and his ears grew deaf and his feet grew weak and his hands were stayed from movement. And then he returned to his place in the dust, to a house where none would visit him again and no soul would accompany him and no companion would befriend him and no merciful one would show him mercy and no lamp would illuminate him. And we all do now, with his tongue, acknowledge this and confess Thy loving care which preceded him through Thy grace. But I beseech Thee, O my God and my Lord and my Beloved, since Thou hast related him to those servants whom Thou hast related to Thyself - I beseech Thee by them and by the lights of Thy most splendid countenance and by Thy greatest signs and by the holy manifestations in the temples of eternity, that Thou forgive him and remit his misdeeds, then accept from him what he failed to do in Thy days, then pardon what he failed to do when Thy lights were revealed, then cause him to dwell beneath the shadow of Thy loving care in the garden whose breadth Thou hast made as the breadth of Thy heavens and Thy earth.

The way was barred until he entered the paths of Thy loving-kindness. It was as though he walked in his own person, so great was his yearning to meet Thee; that he might arrive at the gate of the City of Thy Oneness, and attain the glorious seats of Thine Eternity. At length he stood before the Tabernacles of Thine Exaltation and the Canopy of Thy Majesty in the Habitation of Holiness in the shelter of the Sanctuary of Thy Grandeur, the Garden of Thy Beauty and the City of Thy Guidance; and attained, through that surpassing honour and superlative distinction, unto a state wherein the cord of his servitude was strengthened by the fibre of Thy Lordship, and the lamp of his poverty was kindled by the wicks of Thy riches. Thereupon he entered into the depths of the oceans of the Divine Essence before the surging of the Verses of Thy glorious sovereignty. Unto Thee be praise, therefore, O my God, for whatsoever Thou hast bestowed upon him by Thy bounty, and honoured him withal by Thy power; and unto Thee be thanks for all Thou hast sustained him withal of the gems of hidden favours, and the wonders of his treasured mercy, which have come to fruition upon the trees of love in the inmost realities of hearts. I ask Thee, then, O my God, to cause him to hearken unto the call of this Firebird in this Abha Paradise, that with his whole being he may come forth for the sake of establishing Thy victory in the kingdom of Thy creation and in the dominion of Thy glory; and that his spirit may be purified from all that hath not been ordained by Thy decree, nor enjoyeth the sanction of Thy good pleasure: forasmuch as Thou holdest in Thy hands the reins of all things.

Remember Thy servant who hath believed in God and in whose heart hath entered the love of Thy Supreme and Most Great Self. Then make mention of him in the Tablet, that neither the tempests of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God, nor the storms of the deniers may move him. By God, the True One! Whosoever remaineth steadfast in this Cause this day, verily the denizens of the Supreme Concourse shall circle round him, and then the billows of the Names. For this is a Cause the like of which hath never appeared in creation, and to this My tongue now beareth witness. But the people hear not My words and have denied this resplendent and wondrous Beauty by veiling themselves from it. O servant! Should thine own self oppose thee in My Cause, sever its head and fear not its passing. Place thy trust in God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Ancient. And shouldst thou see among the people of the Bayan one who denieth this Beauty, draw nigh unto him and stand before his eyes and say: \"O thou who associateth partners with God! By what proof didst thou believe in 'Ali while denying Him Who sent him with the truth? Alas for thee and for those who have denied God, the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Peerless!\" Beware lest the pride of the turbans of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God prevent thee. All that thou hast witnessed among the people of the Furqan (Muslims), witness it in these people, for there is no difference between them. Those denied God when He appeared with the name of 'Ali in truth, and these have denied Him when He appeared once again with this Name, at which all who are in the heavens and earth were struck with terror. O servant! Leave them and what they possess, then take the Book of God with a strength from Him and recite it with the melodies of the unitarians, that it may draw thee away from thy self and thy desires and bring thee to this hallowed station whose courtyard the Spirit of Truth sweepeth clean. And the Glory be upon thee and upon those who are with thee in this Cause and who, when they hear this Name, fall prostrate upon their faces and lay their cheeks in the dust in humility before God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers of old.

Happy is the man who on this Day hath beheld His face and toward whom the eye of God, the Help-in-Peril, the Self-Subsisting hath been directed.\n\nSay, We have commemorated the Feast in the Most Great Prison, notwithstanding that the kings have risen up against Us; yet neither the ascendancy of the concourse of the oppressors can frustrate Our purpose, nor can the multitude of the hosts of the earth perturb Our mind. This is that whereunto the All-Merciful beareth witness from this glorious station.\n\nSay, will the Quintessence of assurance be dismayed before the tumult of the people of the world? Nay, by His Beauty that hath shed its radiance upon all created things, be they of the past or of the future. This is the dreadful majesty of God that hath encompassed the entire creation. This is His transcendent power that pervadeth all mankind. Take ye fast hold on the cord of His sovereign might and celebrate the praise of your Lord, the Unconstrained, at the break of this Day, through which every hidden secret hath been brought to light. Thus hath the Tongue of the Ancient of Days spoken on this Day -- the Day whereon His sealed wine hath been unsealed. Take ye heed that the vain imaginations of such as have disbelieved in God perturb you not, nor idle fancies turn you away from this Path which extendeth far and wide.\n\nO people of Baha! Soar ye on the wings of detachment in the atmosphere of the love of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Arise ye then to render Him victorious in pursuance of that which hath been revealed in the Preserved Tablet. Beware lest ye contend with any one amongst the people of the world. Proclaim ye the truth by diffusing the sweet savours of God and by spreading abroad His holy Utterances, for through the potency of these two instruments all men would be enabled to turn their faces towards Him; however those who fail to recognize the glory of this Day, will find themselves bewildered in the drunkenness of their selfish desires and are truly bereft of understanding. Blessed in the man who, lowly and suppliant, lifteth up his face towards the Day-Spring of the signs of His Lord.\n\nIt behooveth thee to arise amidst the people and to acquaint them with that which hath been set down in the Book of their Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: Fear ye God and follow not the vague fancies of those who walk in the footsteps of the doubter and the impious. Turn yourselves with radiant hearts towards the throne of your Lord, the Possessor of names. Indeed He will graciously aid you through the power of truth. No God is there but Him, the Most Excellent, the All-Bountiful.\n\nHow strange that ye should blunder on towards but a pool, willing to forgo the Most Great Ocean which lieth before your eyes. Ponder ye attentively and follow not every ungodly plotter.\n\nThus warbleth the Bird of Eternity upon the branches of Our divine Lote-Tree. God beareth me witness that through a single melody voiced by it, the concourse on high and the denizens of the cities of names have been enraptured, and beyond them those who circle in adoration around the Throne in the daytime and in the night season have been enravished.\n\nSuch are the effusions of the showers of divine utterance which pour down from the heaven of the Will of your merciful Lord. It beseemeth you to set your hearts towards Him and abstain from imitating those who have cavilled at the signs of God and denied their Lord of Mercy when He did appear, invested with proofs and testimonies.\n\n=== END BH02783 ===\n\n=== START BH02784 ===\n\nLahajan.

He shall strengthen thee through His grace from His presence, and He is the Ever-Bestowing, the Ancient. Look, then remember what the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an: \"The Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.\" When the lights of the dawn of the Day shown forth and gleamed, the divines and mystics turned away from it, until they pronounced judgment against Him Who came with manifest wrong. They had been waiting through the nights and days for the appearance of the Manifestation of their Lord, the All-Merciful, but when He appeared in truth they turned away from Him and disputed His verses which encompassed the heavens and earth. They committed that which the divines of idolatry did not commit when Muhammad the Messenger of God came, nor the Jewish divines when the Spirit came with a clear command. Thus was the matter decreed, but most of the people are among the ignorant. They cast the Book of God behind their backs in that they followed every ignorant doubter.\n\nArise to serve the Cause with wisdom and utterance, and remind those in creation of what hath shown forth and dawned from the horizon of God's will, the Lord of the worlds. Grieve not at separation and its might, for He recordeth for whomever desireth it the reward of attaining His mighty, impregnable presence. He verily seeth and judgeth; with Him is the knowledge of all things in a mighty Book. Blessed is the tongue that speaketh the truth, and the heart that turneth to the Single One, the All-Wise, and the pen that setteth down the traces of its Lord, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful. Say: Should one who crieth out come to you with tablets of fire, cast them behind you, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. The Glory be upon thee and upon those whom neither the books of the world nor the clamor of the nations have prevented from this Most Great Book which speaketh: \"There is none other God but Me, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.\"\n\n=== END BH02793 ===\n\n=== START BH02794 ===\n\nO My Flower! How many were the dervishes who became wanderers in the deserts of longing in remembrance of their Lord, and swimmers in the oceans of yearning, spending their days mentioning the Beloved in cities and marketplaces, yet never attained His presence in His days. Some did not recognize the days of the Spirit, and some, through their own heedlessness, remained veiled from the knowledge and presence of the Beloved even after recognizing the days of God. But you, O My Flower, have attained to the divine holy Ridvan and inhaled the fragrance of the flowers of divine wisdom. Your separation was transformed to union, your remoteness joined to presence, your distance changed to nearness, and your sorrow turned to joy. All those souls were gathered unto you, and through you all were assembled and returned before God. Such is the all-encompassing grace of your Lord which has encompassed all the heavens and earth and what lies above them of thrones and chairs and their bearers. And We have bestowed reward in this pure and blessed leaf upon all who have been designated by this name from the beginning that has no beginning until the end that has no end. We have named this blessed night the Night of Holiness, and it has been ordained that all dervishes should pass this blessed night and its morning in utmost joy and delight, occupied in remembrance of their Beloved. It is incumbent upon all the loved ones of God to assist these people on this noble festival according to their means and capacity, and prepare themselves through this supreme grace so that on the day of the manifestation of the Most Upright and Most Great Luminary, exalted be His grandeur, they may turn toward God's direction and turn to no direction but His. This servant has become disappointed with the people of the Bayan, for no sweet fragrance is perceived from this group, save those whom God has assisted. Perchance this party will separate itself from other parties and hasten to the right hand of the Most Holy Throne, which is the seat of that Sovereign of existence, and arrive at the shore of God, which is the place of presence before that Root of the Blessed Tree that is neither of the East nor of the West.

Blessed art thou, O servant, inasmuch as the breezes of the All-Merciful have wafted over thee and awakened thee from slumber. This is a bounty that no created thing, whether of the past or future, can equal. Be thou steadfast in thy love for thy Lord, then make mention of Him throughout thy days. Verily, through His remembrance hearts are quickened. By My life! Were people to know what rank is ordained in this Day for the loved ones of God, they would all detach themselves from all who are in the heavens and on earth, and would turn unto that hallowed and praiseworthy station. Grieve not over what people say. By God, the Truth! They are the ones who sleep. Were they to perceive less than what can be counted, they would weep and lament, then flee from their own selves. As for thee, rejoice in that thou hast attained unto the Cause of God, even though the Youth is in this prison in manifest sorrow. Say: Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I am he who hath fled from his self and his desires and turned toward the direction of Thy good-pleasure. Therefore, O my Beloved, deprive me not of what Thou hast ordained for them that are near unto Thee among Thy chosen ones. Thou art, verily, the One Who hath power over whatsoever He willeth. Thou knowest what is within me and witnesseth my state. With Thee is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and Thou art the Truth, the Knower of things unseen. O my Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast distinguished between Thy servants, that Thou wilt not remove me from the shore of Thy grace and bounties, nor deprive me of the fragrances that waft forth at all times from the paradise of Thy gifts and favors. O my Lord! Send down upon me from the clouds of Thy mercy that which will sever me from all else save Thee and draw me nigh unto meeting with Thee in this Day wherein all have denied Thee and Thy signs, save a numbered few. O my Lord! Make me steadfast in Thy love, then cause me to taste the sweetness of Thy remembrance, then raise me to the heaven of Thy nearness and the court of Thy holiness and the place of meeting with Thee and Thy most holy, most glorious, mighty and beloved presence. Thus have We revealed unto thee in truth that thou mayest read it and be of them that are assured.

This is a Day wherein the Sun has shone upon all contingent beings. Blessed is he who has attained its lights and manifestations, and woe to him who has turned away from it by following every rejected ignorant one. Joy to those who have attained the recognition of God and testified to that which God testified before the creation of all things - that there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Loving.\n\nGod willing, may you be joyous through the bounties of the Self-Sufficient, the Transcendent in all conditions. This is a Day wherein divine grace has encompassed all, and whatsoever flows from the Most Exalted Pen holds sway over all. However, the station of those souls who have turned to the Truth with perfect steadfastness and certitude is known and evident before God. These are they who have borne the Word of God and heard with attentive ears. All divine outpourings today are directed to such souls, and whoever remains distant from this most exalted, most glorious station has been and will be deprived of divine tablets and heavenly books. God willing, the loved ones of God in that land must be engaged in divine remembrance with perfect love and unity, turning away from all else.\n\nTwo letters from you arrived in the Most Great Prison and the fragrance of love was inhaled from them, and the names mentioned therein were noted.

Verily, they who have denied the signs of God--these shall have no portion of this grace, even should they come with the scriptures of the ancients and the writings of the latter generations. Soon shall the traces of Satan, who hath denied God, thy Ancient Lord, be spread abroad in that place. Guard thyself from the intimations of them who have joined partners with God and from the souls of men, if thou be of them that are able. By God! Whoso drinketh the choice wine of His love shall become enabled through the sovereignty of his Lord, Who created all contingent things through His firm and wondrous command. For this is the Day whereon God hath manifested Himself with all names unto all things. Whoso turneth unto Him--from him shall appear the evidences of his Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And whoso turneth away becometh deprived, and is indeed the most abject of servants, even should he possess great might. Turn not thy gaze from the Most Sublime Vision, but rather be illumined from this shining and luminous horizon. Say: O people! Change not the blessing of God within yourselves, and be not of the wrongdoers. This, verily, is He Who sent down the Bayan in remembrance of His blessed and wondrous Name, and by Whose name the Spirit crieth out in the Concourse on high, and the Faithful Spirit likewise. He, verily, is the One Who hath rent asunder the veils of names through His transcendent sovereignty, and brought forth the hand of divine favor from the horizon of the Unseen: lo, it is white to them that know. Say: O people of Baha! Be so steadfast in your love for your Lord, the Most Exalted, that Satan shall not be able to draw breath in your midst. Thus doth your Lord, the All-Merciful, command you aforetime, and now in this perspicuous Tablet. Detach yourselves wholly from all else but Him. Your Lord sufficeth you above all created things. Blessed art thou for having entered the garden of eternity, and found the fragrance of its flowers, and heard the melodies of its nightingale, the murmur of its waters, and the cooing of its dove, and become of them that have attained.

You have drawn near to the Divine Lote-Tree and heard from it the melodies of your Lord, the Most Exalted. You have attained His presence, beheld His countenance, and appeared before God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. All this is from God's bounty upon you. Give thanks to Him by night and day, and glorify your Lord with praise among His slumbering servants, that perchance they may arise from sleep and turn toward the Face whereby the Hour has come and earthquakes have seized all who dwell on earth, and whereby all in the heavens and earth were terrified, save those whom the hand of your Lord's grace had taken hold, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the Most High, the All-Praiseworthy. Know then that what you crafted has been presented before the Throne in this Prison. We beseech God to aid you in His love and good-pleasure and to grant you what He has ordained for His sincere servants. But the Youth has not taken for Himself any house adorned with worldly ornaments, nor has He desired for Himself any life sustained by what exists in earth and heaven. At all times His gaze has been fixed upon the direction of His Lord, the All-Merciful, desiring naught save to ascend unto Him and to dwell in that station which transcends mention and utterance. Thus have We sent down the verses to you from this remote spot. Grieve not for what has befallen Us, for tribulations do not cause Us to despair of God's spirit and mercy. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Assist Him throughout all days - thus have We commanded you in this glorious Tablet. What you crafted out of love for God - We have accepted it from you and from him who was the cause of it, as a grace from Us. God will soon reward you with the best of rewards in both beginning and end. Even if you had no other deed in this world, this deed would suffice you and make you independent of all else.

When thou dost inhale the fragrance of the All-Merciful, arise and say: O people! The proof has been perfected, the evidence has come, and the Cry has been raised amongst the worlds. We sent it upon a human temple and dispatched him to the chief of the oppressors with a Tablet from thy Lord, the Mighty, the Inaccessible. When he appeared, he raised the Tablet through the grace of the Spirit with such steadfastness as amazed the denizens of the highest Paradise, then the dwellers of the celestial garden and the hosts of favored angels. Through this We manifested the power of thy Lord that they might know that prison and tribulation have not prevented Us from the remembrance of God, the Most High, the Great. We proclaim at all times: O peoples of the worlds! This is your Lord, the All-Merciful, Who has come with the truth - turn to Him with your hearts and be not of the heedless. Through His power the sun of might has shone forth and through His proof the proofs of the Messengers have appeared. Were it not for Him, the All-Merciful would not have been manifest, the evidence would not have come, and the faces of those who have attained to this wondrous Cause would not have been illumined. Blessed is the one who has arisen in the name of the All-Merciful, detached from the worlds, who has taken the wine of detachment in the name of the Creator of innovation and drunk thereof despite the polytheists. Does the animal desire the water of life? Nay, by My Self, were ye of those who know! O people of Baha! Give thanks to your Lord for having aided you to recognize the Manifestation of His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Stand firm in your station and arise to assist the Cause with such steadfastness as cannot be shaken by the might of the hypocrites.

Those who claimed relationship with the Truth have, in the Great City, committed that which no opponent has ever committed. They have abandoned trustworthiness and cleaved to treachery, and have become so consumed with the fire of greed and passion that the Pen is powerless to describe it. Now they have arisen to harm the Wronged One and to abase the Cause. They stole a sum of money belonging to the Afnan and attributed it to others. And when that which is hidden in the breasts and the treachery of eyes was revealed, they raised the standard of hypocrisy. Some of those funds they gave to their like so they would assist them in their falsehood, that they might agree with them. Thus did their souls entice them. O My friends in that land! Blessed are ye and joy be unto you, for ye have attained to that which most of the servants have failed to attain.

If thou meetest the friends of God, convey to them greetings and remind them of the days of His manifestation, that perchance the fire of remembrance may burn away the veils of the people and draw them nigh unto the Truth. The world was and ever shall be transient. I swear by the Sun of Utterance, rising from the Dayspring of the mouth of the All-Merciful, that should anyone for a moment gaze with the eye of insight and reflect, he would observe all things to be non-existent and extinct, save those souls who hold fast to the cord of the love of the All-Merciful and cling to the hem of His bounty. By My life! They are indeed the triumphant ones, they are indeed the near ones, and they are indeed the sincere ones.

How many handmaidens and princesses of the earth were expectant and seeking the manifestation of Truth, yet now all are veiled from Him and occupied with their own desires. Praise be to God that thou hast attained to that which the men of the world are deprived of, save those whom the hand of divine power hath rescued and whom God hath guided to His holy, manifest and luminous path.

Among them was the Lord of the Worshippers and the Ornament of the Unity of God. They were asked: \"Are you the rebels?\" He replied: \"No, by God! We are servants who have believed in God and His signs. The smile of faith hath appeared on our faces and the darkness of creation hath been dispelled by our presence. Through us was raised the pavilion of divine knowledge and strengthened the pillars of faith.\" They were asked: \"Have you made lawful what God hath forbidden, or forbidden what God hath made lawful?\" He replied: \"No, by God! We are the first to follow God's commandments.\" They were asked: \"Have you abandoned the Qur'an?\" He replied: \"We are of the household wherein the Qur'an was revealed. Through us appeared the sign of the All-Merciful, and with us are its meanings and mysteries. From us came its remembrance and its spread.\" They were asked: \"For what crime have you been afflicted?\" He replied: \"For the love of God and our detachment from all else.\"\n\nToday people deny the deeds of those who tyrannized in the past, while they commit tyranny worse than what was committed before, and they perceive it not. It is as though they feel secure from the grave and are guaranteed immortality. I know not in what valley they wander. Do they not see that they depart and return not? Do they not know that tomorrow they shall be called to account and shall not be ransomed? How long will they drag the skirts of passion and traverse the hills of error? By God!

Give him the glad-tidings of My loving-kindness, My grace and My mercy. The letter which was sent from Iran was likewise presented before the Presence and its contents were heard in detail. This is the Day of God, wherein none is mentioned save Him. All names stand still in their own station. No one is permitted to utter a word except as ordained by God in the Most Holy Book which hath been sent down from the kingdom of My wondrous utterance. Whosoever speaketh the words of truth is assuredly beloved in the presence of the Throne, but those souls who are extinct in self and alive in God - they are the upright souls who are content and are a source of contentment. God willing, may all attain to this exalted and most exalted station. This word is from the previous Manifestations. One of the holy ones said: \"O Lord, how can I reach Thee?\" He replied: \"Cast away thyself, then come.\" Thus hath the Tongue spoken in the kingdom of utterance.

At the end of the letter, We make mention of the one who wrote to the Afnan about events in those parts, that he may rejoice and be numbered among the thankful. We, from this station, send Our greetings upon him and upon those who have believed in God in that place, as a token of grace from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

Thou hast ever been mentioned on the carpet of captivity in this land, and thy works are witnessed, thy poetry remembered, and thy praise heard. We beseech God to aid and assist thee in that which is conducive to the guidance of His servants. Praise be to God, His Majesty Sultan Abdul-Hamid - may God, blessed and exalted be He, strengthen him - is personally occupied day and night with improving the affairs of his subjects and kingdom. Thou knowest and hast known that he hath never compromised with anyone, and whatsoever hath proceeded from his pen and tongue is the undoubted truth. In all matters and affairs, under the leadership of His Majesty the Sultan, the carpet of consultation is spread, and without regard for rank or station he hath judged and continueth to judge with justice. Therefore all must supplicate the King of existence and the Lord of the seen and unseen for his protection. In truth he is the pride of most sovereigns. Some among this people practice what is forbidden in God's Book and abandon what is commanded therein. During the days of Ashura, this Wronged One was occupied with commemorating the tribulation of the Prince of Martyrs, yet some cling to other practices, and this is a grievous error and a forbidden act. Although this people believe that the Imams - God's blessings be upon them - have risen from their graves, yet other groups, from the Shaykhis to those above them and the Fourth Pillar and the rest of the Shi'ih, all deny this matter. This is why every year in the month of Muharram strife ariseth and the fire of hatred is kindled. In most Tablets We have forbidden the servants from contention, conflict, corruption and whatsoever causeth grief to existence. Nevertheless there hath appeared that which causeth sorrow to those near and sincere. Verily He speaketh the truth and guideth the way, and He is the Single, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful. In truth, excessive hardship hath befallen thee in the path of God, the Lord of all beings, yet in His love deadly poison is the ultimate desire.

There hath appeared and shone forth and become manifest from the horizon of the Divine Will that which hath attracted unto itself the Concourse on High, the dwellers of Paradise, and the people of the cities of justice and fairness who have turned away from the world, advancing toward God, the Incomparable, the All-Informed. In these days there hath come upon Us that which hath caused the hearts of those near unto God to melt. The fires of greed and passion and lust and lewdness have been kindled in the Great City. They have consumed the properties of the Afnan and have raised their voices amongst the people with manifest tyranny. Thus have their souls prompted them to that which hath caused the countenance of trustworthiness and justice to be sullied. He Who speaketh in every condition beareth witness to this, saying: \"There is none other God but Me, the Forgiving, the Generous.\" They have committed that which was forbidden them in the Book of God and have perpetrated that which causeth the people of chastity and godliness to lament, and every man of learning whom knowledge hath not withheld from the Known, and every mystic who hath wholly advanced toward God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The Wronged One, in the midst of tribulation, calleth thee and maketh mention of thee with that which gladdeneth the hearts of them that remember.

And that joy, in reality, did not even go with you - it was very unfaithful, for it left us and did not accompany you either. Surely you too were saddened by separation from the Beloved of all horizons. In any case, at this time He commanded this servant to write to the Overseer: \"O stranger in foreign lands! God willing, may this exile become the cause and means of comfort for steadfast and assured souls in the homeland. Many times exile leads to finding a homeland, and many are the homelands whose dust of exile is more excellent and beloved in God's sight. Exile in the path of the Friend is more beloved and precious to lovers than their homeland. And to God belongs the command in all conditions.

This servant has nothing worthy present except half a container of the finest tea available - that is, the finest that exists in this land - and two or three servings of extremely excellent tea that came from India in previous years.

Morning and evening, the peoples of the earth, of diverse faiths, turn toward mosques and temples and churches and shrines for the remembrance of God, yet remain heedless of Him Who is remembered. At the very moment of remembrance, He Who is remembered standeth before their eyes, yet they see Him not and recognize Him not; they hear, yet comprehend not. All this heedlessness and error and ignorance that hath encompassed the world - its primary cause and reason have been and continue to be the divines of the earth, for they have devised vain imaginings and, through a hundred thousand strategems and deceits, have caused these imaginings to enter into the minds of the ignorant of the earth. So long as these vain imaginings persist, they remain deprived of the splendors of the sun of certitude. Thus have they themselves and their hapless followers been deprived of the outpourings of divine grace and of that which would profit them. Were the rulers of the earth in truth obedient to these heedless souls, no trace of God and His tokens would be found in the world, save with those souls who are sanctified from the doubts and veils and vain imaginings of men. They are honored through the name of Truth, while clinging to diverse means in their abasement of Truth. Would that they had contented themselves with this! Nay, by My life! Every possessor of insight witnesseth the traces of the tyranny of these heedless souls. Blessed is the learned one who recognizeth Him Who is the Object of all knowledge.

The friends must at all times increase in the warmth of divine love. Warmth is manifested through love, and love is achieved through turning towards Him. God willing, thou and the friends shall be enkindled by the fire of the Divine Lote-Tree, illumined by the light of recognition, and engaged in all conditions in service to the Cause. Today service to the divine Cause consists in making people aware of that which benefiteth them and deeds that cause the fire of hatred and animosity to be stilled in the hearts and minds of the various peoples.\n\nSay: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me, caused me to hear, given me to drink, and made me turn toward the court of Thy glory after the turning away of most of Thy creatures. I beseech Thee, O Possessor of the kingdoms of knowledge and wisdom, by Thy Name through which Thou didst subdue all possibility and by which the hearts of all religions were attracted, to assist me to make mention of Thee and to praise Thee with wisdom and utterance. O my Lord! Aid me and Thy loved ones to accomplish good deeds and righteousness. O my Lord! Thou seest me standing before the door of Thy generosity, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty. Ordain for me that which will cause me to be detached from all else but Thee and to hold fast to the ropes of Thy mercy and forgiveness. O my Lord! Ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones, then write down for me that which will draw me nigh unto Thee and strengthen me in Thy service. Verily Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest. There is no God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Generous.\n\nThere hath been presented before the Wronged One that which thy son Ahmad - upon him be My glory - composed and recited before My face. We have answered him with verses that cannot be equaled by the treasures of the earth nor the wealth of all people. O Ahmad! We have heard how thou hast praised God, the Lord of the mighty throne, and We found in thy verses the fragrance of the love of God, the Goal of the mystics. We beseech Him to strengthen thee with the hosts of utterance, to aid thee in His remembrance, and to exalt thee through His name amongst His servants. Verily He is the All-Bountiful, the Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nSay: Praise be to Thee, O Ocean of Bounty, and thanksgiving be unto Thee, O Sun of Grace and Glory! I beseech Thee not to disappoint me of what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. Enable me to perform such deeds as are adorned with the glory of Thy acceptance.

Praise be to God that it adorned the world of separation with the ornament of reunion. Separation is a burning fire; if it leads to reunion it becomes a fire heralding light, just as the Tree of Sinai first appeared in the form of fire and later manifested with a light above all lights. There hath appeared from His presence that from which every possessor of smell perceiveth the fragrance of eternity, by the testimony of the Supreme Pen, and none hath the right to speak a word when His testimony appeareth in the kingdom of creation.\n\nIn any case, all of it was presented in the Most Holy Court.

With both outer and inner tongue I offer countless glorifications to His honor and convey numberless greetings.\n\nThe letter from the beloved and honored Haji Mirza Mahmud, upon him be all His Most Glorious Beauty, cast upon the mirror of the heart the effulgence of the stations of love and affection. A hundred thousand thanks and praises be unto God, glorified be His majesty, that He adorned him with the ornament of favor and guided him to the ocean of reunion. Whatever he had written was presented in the presence and achieved the honor of being heard. His mention hath been and is in the Most Holy Court. The servant beseecheth his Lord to ordain for him the good of the hereafter and of this world. Verily He is the Lord of all beings and the One with power over whatsoever He willeth.\n\nFurthermore, this servant ever presenteth in its proper place the mention of the honored Afnan of the Divine Tree, upon them be all His Most Glorious Beauty. It is most clear and evident that the mention of this servant was not and is not worthy, but mention in the presence of the King of Mention is accepted and beloved.

Upon thee be the glory of God and the glory of all who exist in the unseen and visible realms. The Pen desires to speak, but the ears of the world do not wish to hear. If I write \"z\" and \"b\", \"t\" and \"k\" follow behind, and if we eat the same soup every day, it has not and will not have freshness. In the city they cook fava beans daily and serve chickpeas, following in the footsteps of their fathers. We do not like fava beans and chickpeas. What can be done? In any case, these words are excessive and may cause trouble and become bothersome. However, praise and thanks be to God, in the past year the world of being, by the command of the Sovereign Worshipped One, detached from spirit and wealth, attained their goal and visited and circumambulated the divine Ka'bah and His House. The words \"Pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto God\" and \"A proclamation from God on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage\" so attracted hearts and souls that neither the clamor of plague nor the assault of the accursed cholera prevented the faithful from turning to and striving between Marwah and Safa and circumambulation. This brief mention is more fitting and sweeter than a hundred thousand lengthy accounts of the tales of Caesars and Persian kings and tyrants and Pharaohs and the transgressors of the Umayyads and the ignorant ones of the Abbasids. When thou goest before the Friend, convey the glorification of the Friend. The weather is sometimes clear, sometimes warm, sometimes cold, and sometimes cloudy. The ignorant one speaks crookedly and confusedly. I know not what use or fruit these ravings have. This much I say: remembrance of the Friend is good and beloved and effective. When thou goest before the Beloved of the soul, the gift of the flowing soul is proper. This is good, this is beloved. If you go, you will relate, see and hear. My master, sometimes the pen sniffs the air. Until here was from it, but through divine bounty and infinite effort, if movement becomes possible and joy is attained through meeting the Friend, convey glorification and utter nothingness and complete evanescence. Glory be upon thy presence and upon him and upon those who love God and His friends.

Glorified, glorified art Thou, O Thou in whose hand is the kingdom of the realm of the heavens and earth! O Thou through whose word from Thee the contingent beings were struck unconscious and their pillars scattered, and through another word were gathered together and each part was joined to another part! Glorified art Thou, O Thou who hast power over all who are in the heavens and earth, and art mighty over all who are in the dominion of Command and Creation!

How blessed art thou that the breezes of eternity have wafted upon thee from the Ridvan of My Most Exalted Name, the All-Knowing. Every soul should find from thee the fragrances of the hosts of God and inhale from thee the sweet scents of the garment of Joseph of God, the Mighty, the Luminous. How excellent it is for thee that thou hast attained the most great attainment in thy meeting with them, and thy turning to their beings, and thy orientation with their party, and thy settling in their dwelling-place, and thy hearing of their wondrous melodies, and thou wert among the triumphant ones. It behooveth thee now to stand firm in the Cause of God, thy Lord, in these days and to be watchful of the command of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Had We found the people of the Bayan yearning toward God, We would have commanded them to visit thee in that land and to circle round about thee, for thou art of the remnant of Our detached loved ones. And if at times hesitation seized thee, God hath forgiven what is past, for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Be thou assured in thyself that God hath ordained for thee in His presence a holy and noble station and hath accepted from thee thy obedience and whatsoever hath proceeded from thee, for He is the Kind, the Merciful. Beware lest vain imaginings cause thee to slip from the path of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, and thou become of those who are tested. Leave behind thee all who are in the heavens and on earth, then turn with thy heart toward the direction of My Name, the Mighty, the Powerful. Thus hath the Strong in Command taught thee and strengthened thee with the Spirit of Power, from the presence of One All-Knowing, All-Informed.

Were he not mindful of the decree of the Book, he would have kissed the hands of his killer in the path of God, the Supreme, the Mighty, the Powerful. Say: Those who have understood the stations of the Cause from the Sovereign of might and glory will never fear anyone, even if all the hypocrites should gather against them. At all times they await tribulations out of love for their Ancient Lord, and they long for calamities as an infant longeth for its mother's breast. God sufficeth as witness to what I say. O people of the Bayan! Fear ye no one, for God hath power over you and causeth to flow upon you what He willeth. None besides Him hath any power over aught, and this is a certain truth. By God! If the loved ones of God knew what hath been ordained for them in the paradise of nearness and glory, they would sacrifice their souls and possessions at every moment. But they are veiled from this through their attention to the ornaments of earthly dominion, and therefore tribulations become difficult for them in the path of their Creator. This indeed is manifest heedlessness. Therefore, O my God! Give them to drink of the wine of Thy grace and bounty, that they may not be occupied with aught but Thee nor desire anything besides Thee. This indeed is a mighty favor. Then make them steadfast in Thy love such that they turn not to those who move in the atmosphere of heedlessness and claim for themselves that which hath not been ordained for them from the presence of One Wise, All-Informed.

God willing, thou shouldst drink, through the potency of God's Name, from the Kawthar of inner meanings which today floweth from the Wellspring of the merciful Will. The key to the treasured mystery and the hidden secret had ever been recorded and concealed within the divine Books and Scriptures, but today, through celestial grace, that Most Great Key hath become manifest and visible, and it was the Most Great Name of God, through whose blessing the gates of knowledge and wisdom have been and continue to be opened unto hearts. Speak thou through His Name, see through His Name, and find joy through His Name. Most of the people are intoxicated and gladdened by that which is non-existent and lost, clinging to and occupied with mere illusions. God willing, through the grace of the Beloved of all possibility, thou shalt emerge from the sheath of idle fancies that the essence of humanity may become manifest and evident amongst the servants. Thy letter was received and read. We bear witness that thou didst hear and turn and didst attain unto that which God, the Lord of the worlds, did desire. We counsel thee to preserve that which thou hast been given of His all-embracing grace. Say: O my God and the God of all things, my Lord and the Lord of all names! Thou seest and knowest that I have recognized and become certain that this Path is the most excellent and most glorious of all the paths of the world. Therefore have I chosen it as my path that it may lead me unto Thee and bring me nigh unto the court of Thy holiness. O my Lord! This is my face turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, the Station wherein the lights of Thy countenance have shone forth, and this is my heart which hath attained the blessing of turning toward the direction of Thy bounty and grace. I beseech Thee by the revelation whereby the Tree did speak and the Mountain was crushed to dust, to send down upon me that which will dilate my breast and tranquilize my heart and loose my tongue, that I may raise among Thy servants the standard of Thy remembrance and praise, and make known to them Thy all-embracing grace and Thy straight Path, through the wisdom which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. O my Lord! Aid me in Thy days to serve Thy Cause, that I may thereby possess the mention of good throughout the perpetuity of Thy names and attributes.

God hath loved and continueth to love true faithfulness. His true loved ones stand manifest and visible before the Divine Throne. O Lion! Today the Interlocutor of Sinai is seated upon the throne of Revelation and speaketh forth. Blessed is the ear that hath heard and attained, and the eye that hath turned and beheld. Today the people of God must regard all save God as non-existent and count it as nothingness, and must assist His Cause through the hosts of goodly deeds and conduct.

The Most Exalted Pen hath informed all of the braying of these brayerers. Blessed is the soul whom the clamor of the world hath not deprived of the Ancient King. He hath freed himself from names and words and hath sought the ocean of inner meanings. Those souls who were ever heedless of the Cause and concealed behind veils have now emerged. God protect us and you from the evil of such as these. They cling to the vain imaginings of the former people and hold fast to the hem of idle fancies. We beseech God to assist the eyes and ears of the world, that perchance they may behold the Most Exalted Horizon and hearken unto the Divine Call. Praise be to God that thou didst arrive and witness and hear that which was recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Books and Tablets. O Lion!

Now Hadi of Dawlat-Abad hath raised the standard of falsehood and is occupied with forming a party like the previous one. I swear by the Sun of the horizon of proof that he is unaware of the foundation of the Cause, clinging to vain imaginings and grasping at idle fancies. Hath he not seen the fruits of the Shi'ihs' deeds? On the Day of Retribution they committed that which no other sect had ever done. From pulpits they reviled and cursed the Truth, and finally issued the decree for His death. By the life of God! They perpetrated that which neither Jews nor Christians nor any other parties in the world had done. Thus did their souls entice them, and today they are accounted among the idolaters in God's mighty and praiseworthy Book. Say: My God, my God!

Thy station with God is great - preserve it in His Name. The Cause of God is mighty - assuredly it shall encompass the world.

Soon shall the generality of mankind lament and bewail that which hath escaped them in this supreme Manifestation. With thy Lord is the knowledge of all things in His perspicuous Book.

Recount unto the people that which thou hast witnessed of Our Cause, and be thou in such wise that the mention of thy Lord's name may be spread abroad amongst all the worlds.

From him emanates a putrid smell that changes the air of every city, as testified by whoever possesseth sound nature. He calleth people to himself in private, then in public to that which he used to mock before. When We expelled him from the house he arose with new deceit. Say: O people, is he better, or God, the One, the All-Compelling? Be fair then and be not sinful deniers. Would that thou hadst been with Us and become aware of them both and seen the form of fancy which the people have taken for themselves as a friend besides God. By God the Truth! He would stand before Us while We recited the verses to him, and he would write them down morning and evening. But when he uttered a word of his own he grew proud against God and desired what he desired with a tyranny that was in the Tablet mighty.

Thou knowest that my station is but an image of Thy station, that my virtues recount Thy virtues, that within mine inmost being naught can be found except the revelations of Thy signs, and that my very essence is but a reflection of the evidences of Thy unity.\n\nAll these things Thou hast noised abroad among Thy creatures, in such wise that none can recognize me, except as one who beareth Thy name. I swear by Thy glory! My lamentations are not for the things which have befallen me in Thy path, but are due to my recognition that by reason of mine abasement the hearts of them that love Thee have been sore shaken, and the souls of Thine adversaries have been so filled with joy that they rejoice over those who have detached themselves from all except Thee and have hastened towards the river of Thy remembrance and praise. So great is their waywardness that when meeting Thy loved ones, they shake their heads in derision of Thy Cause and say: \"Where is your Lord Whom ye mention in the daytime and in the night season? Where is He to be found Whom ye call your Sovereign, to Whom ye summon all men to turn?\" Their pride and haughtiness waxed greater and greater until they denied the power of Thy might and rejected Thy sovereignty and dominion.\n\nThy glory beareth me witness! I delight in mine own afflictions and in the afflictions which they who love me suffer in Thy path.

How long shalt Thou remain seated, O my God, on the throne of Thy forbearance and patience? Speak Thou Thy word of wrath, O Thou Whom no eyes can see! Well-beloved is Thy mercy unto the sincere among Thy servants, and well-beseeming Thy chastisement of the infidels among Thine enemies. Send down upon them, therefore, O my Lord, that which will unmistakably reveal unto them the fury of Thy wrath and the ascendancy of Thy power, and will enable them to recognize the weight of Thy might and the greatness of Thy strength.

I am carried back to such heights that I recognize my self to be the same as the remembrance of Thee in Thy realm, and the essence of Thy praise among Thy servants. As long as that self endureth, so long will Thy praise continue to be shed abroad among Thy creatures and Thy remembrance glorified by Thy people.\n\nEvery man endued with insight among Thy servants is persuaded that my self liveth eternally and can never perish, inasmuch as remembrance of Thee is eternal and will endure so long as Thine own Self endureth, and Thy praise is everlasting and will last as long as Thine own sovereignty will last. By its means Thou art glorified by such of Thy chosen ones as call upon Thee and by the sincere among Thy servants. Nay, the praise wherewith any one, in the entire creation, praiseth Thee proceedeth from this exalted self and returneth unto it, even as the sun which, while it shineth, sheddeth its splendor upon whatsoever may be exposed to its rays. From this sun is generated, and unto it must return, the light which is shed over all things.\n\nExalted, immeasurably exalted art Thou above any attempt to measure the greatness of Thy Cause, above any comparison that one may seek to make, above the efforts of the human tongue to utter its import! From everlasting Thou hast existed, alone with no one else beside Thee, and wilt, to everlasting, continue to remain the same, in the sublimity of Thine essence and the inaccessible heights of Thy glory.\n\nAnd when Thou didst purpose to make Thyself known unto men, Thou didst successively reveal the Manifestations of Thy Cause, and ordained each to be a sign of Thy Revelation among Thy people, and the Day-Spring of Thine invisible Self amidst Thy creatures, until the time when, as decreed by Thee, all Thy previous Revelations culminated in Him Whom Thou hast appointed as the Lord of all who are in the heaven of revelation and the kingdom of creation, Him Whom Thou hast established as the Sovereign Lord of all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth. He it was Whom Thou hast determined to be the Herald of Thy Most Great Revelation and the Announcer of Thy Most Ancient Splendor. In this Thou hadst no other purpose except to try them who have manifested Thy most excellent titles unto all who are in heaven and on earth. He it was Whom Thou hast commanded to establish His covenant with all created things.\n\nAnd when Thy promise came to pass and the set time was fulfilled, He Who is the Possessor of all Names and Attributes was made manifest unto men.

Were I to praise Thee throughout the duration of Thy kingdom and thank Thee throughout the continuance of Thy dominion, it would still be insignificant compared to the wondrous tokens of Thy grace and bounties which Thou hast singled me out to receive despite my unworthiness - nay, rather, due to the manifestation of Thy favors and the emergence of Thy gifts unto this servant who is the most contemptible of Thy servants and the poorest of Thy creatures.\n\nO my Lord!

And whoso saith that the Manifestations have ended in thy land - pay no heed to him, and be of them who with the eye of God regard His Cause. Say: The Jews claimed that the hand of God is chained up, and likewise do the peoples of latter days say what they said. Say: Woe betide you for what ye utter! His mercy hath preceded all things, and His grace hath encompassed all who are in the heavens and on earth, could ye but know.

All are heedless of His command in these days, save those who behold the Leaf of Paradise with their own eyes and hear the melody of God with their own ears. No hindrance can hinder them, even should all men seek to hinder them. Yet it behooveth the believer to distinguish between truth and falsehood as he distinguisheth between light and darkness, that he may not follow those who claim what God hath not ordained for them and who walk in the ways of their own desires.

The Lord of Heaven hath come with great sovereignty. Fear God and follow not your idle fancies. He announceth unto you the Most Great Favor, and He is the All-Merciful, the Bountiful. Say: Hearken unto the Call from the Divine Lote-Tree. Verily it speaketh the truth by the command of One Who is All-Knowing, All-Wise. By God! This is the Day whereof Moses gave tidings, and concerning which Muhammad, the Messenger of God, gave glad-tidings in His Book, the Book of Wisdom. Beware lest the veils of the world withhold you from the Lord of Eternity. Cast away what the people possess, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised. Say: This is the Day whereon men have arisen unto God, the Lord of all worlds. By God! The dwellers of the graves have risen through the breezes of Revelation, and the companions of the Manifestation rejoice in the light of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Thus hath the Supreme Pen spoken, when the Wronged One was in the house of one of His loved ones who was named 'Abdu'r-Rahim in a preserved Tablet. Say: O peoples of the earth! Behold how the Sun hath dawned from the Most Glorious Horizon and the Light hath shone forth from this noble station. By God! The Lord of Eternity hath ascended the throne of utterance, calling aloud with the most exalted call and summoning all to that which will draw them nigh unto the horizon of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. O 'Ali! What hath befallen thee hath grieved Me. We beseech God, exalted be He, to ordain for thee from His Supreme Pen that which shall profit thee in all the worlds of His worlds. Verily He is the Lord of humanity and the Lord of the throne on high and of the dust beneath. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. Say: My God, my God! I beseech Thee by the mysteries of Thy knowledge, and by Him Who hath appeared before all faces calling all to Thy horizon, and by the Crimson Ark which through Thy command hath sailed upon the sea of inner meanings and utterance, to make me steadfast in Thy love, speaking Thy praise, and serving Thy Cause. Write down for me by Thy Supreme Pen that which will draw me nigh unto Thee in all conditions. Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the Most High.

Grieve not for what hath come upon thee. Consider what hath befallen Us at the hands of the oppressors. When the idolaters desired to extinguish the light of God, they drove Us from Our homes, imagining this would profit them. How evil was their delusion! Through this God exalted His Cause and manifested His sovereignty that overshadoweth the worlds. God will soon reveal through thy departure what He hath purposed. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth. There is no God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. The clamor of those who have disbelieved cannot frustrate Him, nor can the hosts of the heavens and earth prevent Him. Thus doth the Most Exalted Pen give thee glad tidings, that thou mayest rejoice within thyself and be of the thankful ones.\n\nThat which hath befallen that honored one hath been for the sake of God's Cause. Thy reward is with Him. However, in all matters wisdom must be observed, for the people are weak and have not attained maturity. In times of trials and tribulations it is observed that even most of the loved ones become shaken and disturbed. Therefore, in view of Our previous mercy and all-encompassing grace, We have commanded all to observe wisdom, and wherever mention of teaching hath been made, wisdom hath been mentioned before and after. Were the decisive Word to be fully revealed, the people would completely withdraw. In such case, none would give ear to the divine utterances which are the cause of guidance for humanity, nor would they seek nearness to the people of Baha to attain recognition of the Dawning-Place of God's Cause. A number of ignorant ones have become leaders of the people and are counted among the learned, and these souls, in order to preserve their positions, strive with utmost effort to prevent the people, especially if they find a pretext. Soon shall they witness the loss of their own souls and shall become aware of what they have wrought in the days of God, the Self-Subsisting, the All-Compelling.\n\nBlessed art thou for having been enkindled with the fire of God and followed what thou hast recognized from the Book of thy Lord, the Commander, the All-Knowing.

Among them were those who clung to idle fancies, turning away from the Source of divine inspiration, and those who held fast to mere allusions, heedless of the Revealer of verses. Lo! They are among the abased ones.\n\nBlessed art thou for having discovered the fragrance of the Beloved and believed in God, the Single, the All-Informed. Soar with the wings of certitude in the atmosphere of the love of the All-Merciful, celebrating His Name amidst all contingent beings in such wise that the atoms are stirred thereby and the hearts of the heedless are awakened.

Speak thou amongst the peoples in remembrance of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days, in such wise that all in the world may be drawn unto Him. Thy Lord will assist thee as He pleaseth. There is none other God but Him, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.\n\nSay: This is not a day for tarrying. All things have been set in motion by the call of the Lord of Names, and the atoms cry out: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great!\" Blessed is he who hath arisen at the breath of Revelation and aided his Lord in this Cause whereby that which was treasured in God's knowledge, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing, hath been made manifest.\n\nConvey My greetings to those around thee, then gladden them with this Remembrance whereby hearts have taken flight and the souls of those near unto God have rejoiced.

Contention, conflict and corruption have been and are condemned. The friends of God must regard creation with the eye of loving-kindness and draw all to the horizon of guidance through kind counsels and goodly deeds. Many are those who have claimed allegiance to the Truth yet have caused the Cause of God to be compromised. Avoidance of such souls is necessary. And certain people who have not attained to the ultimate purpose in these divine days and have not drunk the choice wine of inner meanings from the cup of utterance become doubtful due to the deeds of the heedless and actions of the pretenders. Thus it was observed that some souls who had ascended to the heaven of faith remained veiled from the horizon of sublime oneness due to the words and deeds of false ones, despite having heard for years this verse:\n\nShould all created things turn unbeliever\n\nNo speck of dust would settle on His grandeur's hem\n\nSome servants attribute to the Truth whatever they observe from those claiming to love Him. Evil is that which they do. In all ages there have been and will be the righteous and the wicked. Should one reflect upon the appearance of the Suns of Truth, it becomes clear and evident that in every age there have been and will be the truthful and the false. Take heed, O ye who possess insight! Pure hearts, illumined eyes and sanctified souls must at all times gaze toward the horizon of the Cause, not toward the deeds and words of pretenders and liars. Beseech God to guide all and enable them to attain His good-pleasure - the good-pleasure of the Dawning-Place of verses - which is identical with His good-pleasure. Verily He is the Answerer, the Bestower, the Forgiving, the Generous. This Tablet hath been sent down from the heaven of divine Will as a token of grace and favor, that all the loved ones may become aware of that which God hath purposed and may avoid the evil of base souls.

We have mentioned you before, and this is yet another time, a grace from God, the Lord of the Beginning and the End. Strive that you may not be deprived of the outpourings of the clouds of divine mercy. Speak for the sake of God and fix your gaze upon God.

All the companions and loved ones of that land must hold fast with perfect certitude and assurance to the cord of the favor of the Beloved of the worlds, in such wise that all the world would be powerless to prevent them. Blessed are they that hold fast, and joy be to them that stand firm. In all conditions you must be mindful of wisdom, for all creatures have been commanded to observe wisdom in the divine Tablets. Blessed is the soul that has believed and acted according to that which it was commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O My loved ones! Hold fast to that which will exalt the Cause of God, then shun that which you have been forbidden in the Book of your Lord, the Evident, the All-Informed. Be not grieved at anything, for He is with you and ordains for you that which will profit you in this world and the next. He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.

Soon will this spread be rolled up by the hand of power, save the spread of deeds of souls who act for God's sake and speak for God's sake. By My life! Theirs shall be a goodly end.

And where is the justice and fairness ye claimed when the Cause was preserved in the treasury of your Lord's protection, the Mighty, the Powerful?

We saved him by means of our grace and revived him through this water that flowed from the pen of God, the king of names. However, he masters every field, joins in every gathering, and listens to what is said. At first, he was with the one who was named 'Ala in the land of Taff. He tends to mysticism. When we entered that city, he used to spend most of his time in my presence. When he saw the sea, he forsook the puddle, and was enthralled by the verses of his lord, the king of creation. He was intoxicated with the heavenly stream of utterance, which flowed from the lips of his lord, the All-Merciful, such that he did not desire to leave my presence. The people of Baghdad bear witness to this, and beyond them all who possess the Mother Book. Thus did the tongue and pen speak from the presence of the Lord of Eternity, and all who have found the fragrance of fairness bear witness to it.

These are the days of relationship with God. Whosoever turns to Him and attains His recognition is reckoned with God and related to Him. This relationship is sufficient, enduring, eternal and everlasting. Blessed is the soul that has clung to the cord of relationship with God and become detached from creation. Such a one is a star in the exalted heaven of the Most Glorious Name. Upon him be the glory of God, his Lord and the Lord of the worlds. At all times you must give thanks to the True Beloved Who enabled you to recognize His sanctified Beauty and guided you to the supreme horizon. As for what you mentioned concerning your father, We have forgiven him as a favor to you and your relatives. Verily your Lord is the Forgiving, the Generous. That helpless one hesitated to turn to the Self-Sufficient, the Most High, because of the false statements of that lame one - upon him be the wrath and punishment of God. Since he had no knowledge of the true matter, he hearkened to the vain words of that wicked one. Never be saddened by this episode, for God has been and ever will be generous, gracious, merciful and compassionate. On this blessed day He adorned him with the robe of forgiveness, that you may give thanks to your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Remind him who was named Jalal from Me and give him the glad tidings of his Lord's favors. Also remind those women who have turned to God and believed in Him, the Lord of the worlds.

Whatsoever exists in the world will soon perish, but this remembrance recorded by the Supreme Pen will endure and remain forever.

Thou didst choose to designate it by this Name, through whose power Thou hast subdued all created things and caused the sweet savours of this Revelation to be diffused amongst all the dwellers of the earth and the inmates of the heavens. Through its potency whatsoever is recorded in Thy holy Scriptures and sacred Books hath been made manifest and Thy messengers and Thy chosen ones have raised their Call, so that all men may be infused with the capacity to attain Thy presence, to direct their steps toward the ocean of Thy nearness, to present themselves before the seat of Thy throne and to give ear unto Thy wondrous Voice, calling aloud from the Dayspring of Thine invisible Essence and from the Dawning-Place of Thine exalted Being.\n\nI yield praise unto Thee, O Lord my God, inasmuch as Thou hast demonstrated Thy proofs and perfected Thy blessings.

Assist them then by Thy grace to consecrate themselves to Thy service, that through them whatsoever Thou desirest for Thy realm may be realized, and with their exertions the ensigns of Thy victory be unfurled in Thy lands.

Thou seest in certain regions, O my God, things disagreeable to Thy good pleasure, and Thou beholdest those who lay claim to Thy love committing such deeds that Thine enemies have committed. Sanctify them, O Lord, with this life-giving water whereby Thou hast sanctified the well-favoured among Thy people and the loved ones who are wholly devoted to Thee. Purge them, moreover, from whatever might tarnish the fair name of Thy Cause in Thy lands, or might deter the people of Thy countries from recognizing Thee. I entreat Thee, O Lord, by the glory of Thy Name that transcendeth all other names, to shield them from following their selfish desires and corrupt inclinations, that they may, one and all, gather together around that which is prescribed in Thy Holy Book. Exalt them then as to become the hands of Thy Cause, that through them Thy wondrous signs may be spread far and wide throughout Thine earth and the emblems of Thy sanctity be manifested amidst Thy people.\n\nPotent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.

I beseech Thee by Thy Baha at its most splendid.\" All have heard that it hath been said that the Most Great Name is mentioned and concealed in this prayer, and now it is manifest and speaking and hath dawned upon all who dwell on earth. What proof could be greater than this, and what evidence mightier than this station? Observe how this blessed word adorns the opening of the prayer. If thou wert to use but this passage alone as proof of the truth of this Cause, none would have cause to waver or turn aside, save the objectors who in every age have been deprived of the choice wine of divine bounty and have clung to the cord of idle fancies. Praise be to the Desire of the world Who hath enabled thee to make mention of this exalted word and this most supreme pearl. Reflect upon this most great Revelation and its effulgences and all that hath been manifested through it. By My life!

Excellent is that which you have asked, for its benefit returns to you and other servants both outwardly and inwardly. Verily your Lord is the All-Knowing, the Answerer. The supreme cause of creation has been the knowledge of God. Whosoever today has attained the fragrance of the merciful Robe and reached that original homeland - which is the station of recognizing the Dawning Place of divine commands and the Dayspring of heavenly revelation - has attained and will attain unto all good. After arriving at this most exalted station, two things are necessary and obligatory for every soul: first, steadfastness in the Cause of God such that if all people should try to prevent him from the Source of the Cause they would be powerless to do so; and second, following the divine ordinances which have flowed from the fountain of the Pen of God's Will, for the knowledge of God is not complete and perfect except through following what He has commanded and what has been revealed in God's Book. In the previous year the Most Holy Book was sent down from the heaven of bounty of the Lord of Names. God willing, you will be assisted to act according to what has been revealed therein. As for material matters, you should engage in work while placing your trust in God. He will send down to you from the heaven of His favors that which is ordained for you.

O servant! Give thanks unto God thy Lord for having been granted that which most of the servants have not been granted. Thus did the mercy which was decreed in truth in the heaven of destiny take precedence over thee and encompass the worlds by the command of thy Lord, the All-Knowing. Yet most people remain heedless of their Lord's mercy and are veiled by the veils of their own selves. Should anyone ask thee concerning this Youth, relate unto him what thou hast witnessed and known. Thus do We command thee in truth by One mighty and wise. Say: He was afflicted at the hands of those who openly denied God, and the Youth was at that time forsaken in their midst. Then mention from Our presence Our loved ones who have detached themselves from the earth and all that is therein and have turned with their hearts to a holy and luminous station. Say: O My loved ones! Grieve not over anything but place your trust in all matters in God, for verily He is your guardian. Not a thing escapeth His knowledge. He knoweth what hath befallen you and what shall befall you hereafter. With Him is the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and knowledge of all things in a preserved tablet. Remember your Lord, the Most Merciful, and leave the worlds behind you. Thus it behooveth one who claimeth the love of God in these days wherein the Sun of grace hath dawned from the horizon of a mighty name. Say: O people! Give thanks unto God for having caused you to know the Manifestation of His Self and preserved you from the depths of fancy and desire and protected you by the hands of the angels of protection and provided you with the fruits of a lofty and glorious Tree. Then convey Our greetings unto the handmaidens who have detached themselves from the left hand of polytheism and turned toward the right hand of an exalted name, that they may give thanks unto God their Lord by night and by day and rejoice with the joy that hath been mentioned in the Tablet.

Give thanks unto God for having been honored to attain His presence and for having heard His most exalted melodies in days when the lights of Beauty were, in very truth, witnessed from behind seventy thousand veils.

I desire naught save your sincerity unto God and your detachment from all else but Him, and verily He watcheth over the doers of good. Cast the world behind thee and grieve not over it. Put thy trust in God, thy Lord, and He will send down unto thee what hath been ordained for thee in the heaven of His decree, and He encompasseth all things. Remember Him in thy days and forget not His grace. By God! Ye have witnessed what no one in creation hath witnessed, would ye but ponder it ye would testify thereto and find yourselves independent of all worlds. Drink thou the water of life in remembrance of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Then detach thyself from all existence and be not sorrowful on earth. Rejoice thou in the joy of the spirit - if sorrow touch thee, sorrow not, and if joy reach thee, joy not, for both shall pass away and have no permanence. What endureth is that which thy Lord hath ordained. Strive thou that what hath been ordained in the Tablets may descend upon thee from a mighty and wondrous Pen. Thus have We sent down unto thee the verses and wafted unto thee the fragrances of thy Beloved from this breeze which hath blown over all worlds.

And when thou findest thyself purified from the signs of the people of creation and established beneath the shade of the Lord of Names, arise to make mention of Him and praise Him amongst His servants, that they may detach themselves from what they possess and turn unto God, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Loving. Beware lest anything prevent thee from teaching thy Lord's Cause. Aid it through remembrance and fear not the hosts of the oppressors. Say: O people! The Revealer of the Bayan hath come again, would ye but know it. The Most Exalted Pen hath appeared, would ye but perceive it. The Divine Lote-Tree hath been raised up, would ye but seek it. Say: The heavenly ascent hath ascended within itself seventy thousand years until it reached its goal and circleth round about it, would ye but understand. Say: Were ye to know, ye would weep for yourselves and lament. Hear My words, then rend asunder the veils through My power and sovereignty, and follow not vain imaginings and idle fancies.\n\nAnd thou, O servant, if thou perceivest in thyself the power to rend the veils of the people, then do so; otherwise, remain in thy place, be patient, and shun the idolaters.

They hasten to the congregational mosques for My remembrance, yet when I manifested My Self they denied it. What aileth these people that they hear not the Word and understand not the Tradition nor the Book?

When manifest power and overwhelming might produced no effect, We sent another sacrifice to the arena of martyrdom. With perfect steadfastness he offered up his life - the most precious and valuable of all things in the world - at the feet of the peerless Friend. Again no effect was visible. Once more the divine will fixed upon another sacrifice, but like before it proved fruitless. And likewise another sacrifice removed the crown of life from his head and offered it at the feet of the Beloved of all possibility. Many were the sacrifices, their ranks and stations beyond enumeration - if ye would count God's blessings, ye cannot reckon them. The Islamic people mention the previous sacrifice in their pulpits and gatherings with utmost humility and reverence, even though he returned alive from the altar of the Friend. Yet the sacrifices of this most great Revelation, which had no likeness or parallel in the world, produced no effect in heedless hearts. The cause and reason for this heedlessness and ignorance were and are the Shi'ih divines, who have educated people in vain imaginings and idle fancies until at last they were deprived of the ocean of manifestation and the call of the Speaker on Sinai.

Blessed be God, Who hath raised up these ones through His sovereign might and power. By God! The scratching of thy pen when inscribing the words of God is better than the worship of both humanity and the jinn, if thou remainest steadfast as thou wert. Take care not to wonder at this bounty. By God! This is but little compared to My bounty. Were the eye of time able, We would show it a sign from the signs of My bounty that it might witness it encompassing all the worlds. But existence cannot bear that the Beloved should appear in the glory of His own Self, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Say: When We removed the veil from the face of the Cause, fewer than can be counted remained steadfast. Whereupon all who dwell in the heavens and earth were terrified. O Haydar! Be as a lion of the Cause in all lands, that through thee the hearts of the polytheists and the hearts of the deceivers may be shaken. Fie upon the people of the Bayan, for they have exchanged the bounty of God and sold the Lord of Lords for a handful of dust, without any proof or scripture. Thus did their evil souls entice them to object to God, the Single One, the Mighty, the Praised. Behold their words and what floweth from their pens. By God! It testifieth against their own selves, yet the people remain heedless. Say: Praise be to God Who hath delivered me from the wrongdoing people and taken my hand with the hands of His power and brought me forth from among the company of the polytheists and purified my heart with the waters of His loving-kindness and sanctified me from the defilement of these deniers who claim faith while disbelieving in Him through Whose finger's motion all religions were abrogated and the laws of mighty glory were renewed. Say: O company of polytheists! By God! Through the scratching of this Pen were created the realities of eternity. Die, therefore, in your wrath, O company of the proud! Read thou this Tablet, then preserve it. By My Self! When it is recited, the denizens of Paradise turn toward thee to hear it. Thus have We commanded thee in truth that thou mayest be among those who act. And the spirit and glory be upon thee and upon thy pen, from which were inscribed the traces of thy Lord, the Chosen One, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving, the Compelling, the All-Subduing, the Generous, the Concealer, the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\n=== END BH02919 ===\n\n=== START BH02920 ===\n\nIn the name of the Persian Speaker!\n\nO Bahram!

Nevertheless, the wicked ones in Iran have not ceased their oppression. Their necks have been stretched forth in hypocrisy. We beseech God to aid them to conduct that is pleasing and acceptable.

Surely by now the friends in the land of Nun and Jim have acted according to that which has shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of consultation. However, in all cases they must pray and beseech God, exalted be His glory, to illumine His Majesty the Sultan with the light of justice and fairness, that he may judge among the servants with pure justice. In times when the fire of hatred is inflamed, they should send their petition to His Majesty the Sultan so that he may be informed of what has befallen them. It is not permissible to seek recourse to various governments. They should seek justice from the Sultan. Verily He heareth and answereth, and He is the Protector, the Helper, the Succourer.

O Muhammad-Qabli-'Ali! I bear witness that thou wert with the Wronged One in Iraq until the time of separation drew nigh, and thou didst migrate with the Ancient Beauty, directing thy steps toward the Land of Mystery by reason of what the hands of the people of discord had wrought on the day of parting, and thence to the Most Great Prison which We have named, in the Scriptures and Tablets, with Our most comely names. Through My remembrance of thee the ocean of forgiveness surgeth, and through My call the fragrance of the mercy of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, is diffused. Blessed art thou, inasmuch as thou hast attained unto the testimony of My Most Exalted Pen in the Most Glorious Horizon. Thou art he who hast attained unto that which God hath revealed in His perspicuous Book. Thou didst forsake that which was with the people, clinging fast to the Self-Subsisting One through Whom the hidden Secret was unveiled and the seal of the choice sealed Wine was broken. My Pen and My Tongue have borne witness unto thee with that whose fragrance shall never cease to endure so long as the kingdom of God, the Lord of the Throne and of the dust, and the Possessor of the next world and of this, shall endure. Thy death was naught but a translation from the earthly abode to the divine dwelling, from the lowest station to the Most Exalted Companion. Thou art he who didst drink the Kawthar of divine knowledge in the earliest days and who didst circle round the Cause until thy days were ended. Blessed art thou, and blessed is he who maketh mention of thee through that which hath been sent down at this time from the Mighty Announcement whereby the heaven of idle fancies was cleft asunder and the earth was rent and the mountains were crushed - a command from God, the Lord of all men. Praise be unto Thee, O God of the world and Desire of the nations, for having fulfilled Thy promise and purified, through the rain-showers of Thy mercy, him who ascended unto Thee and held fast unto Thy cord and was attracted by Thy verses and dwelt in Thy presence. O my Lord! Send down upon him, at all times, the signs of Thy mercy and the heavenly table of Thy grace.

For this world and whatsoever is therein are in His sight no more than a handful of light dust. Say: Verily in this exodus are signs for those who remember, and in this movement are evidences for those who perceive. Say: Therein lieth concealed the wisdom of God, if ye be of them that comprehend. And it shall be made manifest in truth, despite the arrogant ones. Thus do We impart unto thee of the verses of the Spirit that thou mayest be of the guided ones, and stand firm in the Cause and be of them that are steadfast, and find tranquility within thyself such that the hosts of the evil ones shall not cause thee to slip. Beware lest thou forget this counsel from this trusted, all-knowing One. Soon shall Baal roar and the Samiri call out from every nearby place. But ye shall abide beneath the shade of God, the Almighty, the Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Verily He will assist His loved ones with hosts ye cannot see, and this is easy for God to accomplish. And thou, O Baqir, grieve not for what hath befallen Us, and be not of them who are distressed in tribulation nor of them who are content therewith. Be thou content with what God hath ordained for Us, then be patient in the Cause of thy Lord and be of the patient ones. Beware lest thou be dismayed in this greatest dismay wherein the minds of the mystics are bewildered. God shall soon transform thy distress into tranquility and thy sorrow into joy. Verily there is no God but He, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Omnipotent. Say: O people! Hearken unto My call and differ not in God's Cause, and turn not unto them in whose breasts ye find rancor against God, the Mighty, the Supreme, the Bountiful, and from whom the odors of discord are diffused though their tongues may speak with mighty and impregnable words. By God! These are more harmful than all poisons. Fear ye God and draw not nigh unto them, and be not of them that approach them.

If one should quicken a single soul with the sprinklings of the water of life, it is as though he had quickened all mankind. Thus hath it been aforetime decreed: \"Whoso quickeneth a soul is as though he had quickened all mankind.\"\n\nO Husayn! This is the Day of utterance and the Day of the mention and praise of the All-Merciful Lord.

Take hold of the hem of teaching, turning aside from those who have denied the All-Merciful, the Compassionate. Today the manifestations of the whisperer are occupied with the promptings of self, and through a hundred thousand wiles they prevent the hapless people who have no knowledge of the Ocean of divine wisdom and the Sun of insight from attaining unto the truth.

Nimrod acknowledged God when he witnessed the Beauty of God and His power, but the Nimrod of today hath not acknowledged and will never acknowledge, if ye be of those who know. Even if God should bring a company of angels, or the treasures of the heavens and earth, or a manifest sovereignty, or knowledge of what was and what shall be - by God, they will never believe, ever. This is a revelation from God, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. If thou shouldst know what befell the Friend, thou wouldst detach thyself from thine own self and from all who are in the heavens and earth and from all upon which the name of a thing can fall. This indeed is a known truth. But We have veiled the matter in preserved tablets of glory, lest the cry of all things be raised between earth and heaven, and the hearts of those who dwell in the pavilions of grandeur be disturbed, and those who are nigh fall prostrate upon the limited dust. O Khalil! The Beloved speaketh with beloved melodies of sorrow: Soon shall ye bite your fingers in remorse when ye find not the Youth, though ye search throughout the heavens and earth. Thus do We inform you that ye may be of those who are aware. By God the Truth! The eye of creation hath never witnessed its like, nor shall it witness hereafter, and to this do honored servants testify. This Tablet was revealed at a time when the Shirt of God was reddened with blood because one cast upon all created things a letter of the vision he witnessed within himself - He, the Protector, the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. Preserve thou this Tablet and recite it morning and evening, and in all years and months, that perchance the people of the holy places may arise from the couch of heedlessness and become certain of their Lord's verses.

Today is the day of steadfastness. Dissimulation in the Cause of God is not permitted. Hearken unto the voice of the Wronged One. Speak the truth, stand with truth, and utter truth, even if thou shouldst behold all on earth as enemies. For the example of the souls who turn away is like bubbles that appear on the surface of water - they have had and shall have no stability or permanence. God willing, thou must bear hardships for the sake of God and be patient in what hath befallen thee, even as trials greater than those that have befallen all others have befallen the Ancient Beauty, Who even now, in tribulations that cannot be mentioned, is nonetheless occupied with the remembrance of God and His commandments. Thou hast ever been before Our gaze and remembered in the Most Great Scene. Act in a manner befitting this most great station. Remember all handmaidens on behalf of the Wronged One.

This is the day whereon it behooveth every soul, upon hearing the call from the Ultimate Tree which hath grown in the white earth, to say: \"Here am I, here am I, O Lord of all beings!\" This is not the drinking-place of every bewildered one. This is the spring from which all springs have branched forth, and the ocean from which all seas have appeared. Say: O people! Abandon your conjectures. By God!

Praise thy Lord for that thy letter hath attained the presence of the Throne and this Tablet hath been revealed unto thee, from which the fragrance of the All-Merciful passeth over all creation. Be thou steadfast in the Cause, detached from all else. This is what the Cleaver of the dawn counseleth thee. Read thou this Tablet in the nights and days. It will draw thee to a station wherein thou shalt hear from all things: \"Verily, there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the All-Choosing.\" Thus have We adorned the heaven of certitude with the Day-Star of utterance and sent it unto thee as a grace from Us.

And this indeed is a matter which nothing in the heavens and earth can resist, did ye but know.

And should ye detect from anyone the fragrance of rancor, draw not nigh unto him for an instant - thus hath it been inscribed by the Most Holy Pen on a preserved and mighty tablet. Then speak with wisdom and be among the people as one detached who turneth only toward the right hand of nearness to the Beloved. Then dwell, O 'Ali, in thy house until there reacheth thee from Our command or a hidden and secret book. Thus do We cast upon thee words of love that thou mayest find from them the fragrance of musk and be of those who return unto God.

Its opening was adorned with this blessed prayer: \"O my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Glory at its most glorious.\" Observe how the people of the Furqan remain heedless, even though it was previously stated that God's Most Great Name is mentioned in this prayer. To those possessed of insight it is clear and evident that the station of the mention of the Most Great Name must be at the beginning, for it precedes all names and is the source and dawning-place of all remembrance - and indeed it appears at the opening of the aforementioned prayer. Despite this, they all denied it and failed to recognize its truth. Rather, they pronounced sentence of death upon Him, save those whom God preserved through His truth and delivered from the ocean of idle fancies. He, verily, is the Mighty, the Powerful. Blessed art thou for having adorned thy letter with this Name, through which the limbs of the divines trembled and the hearts of the ecclesiastics were troubled, and through which that which was hidden in God's knowledge was made manifest - He, the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. This day is the lord of all days, for the Lord of mankind openly declareth: \"Look! I shall show thee My beauty\" and \"Turn! I shall give thee to drink of the Kawthar of My grace.\" This is such a word that were one of the chosen ones to be blessed with hearing it, he would soar on wings of longing to the horizon from which the Luminary of the world hath shone forth. Whosoever in this Day performeth a service to God's Cause shall endure through the endurance of God's Word. God willing, thou must be enkindled with a newly kindled fire in the days of God and be illumined by the lights of His countenance, in such wise that through the heat of that fire, receptive souls may be warmed by the fire of the love of God. Blessed is the strong one whom the might of the mighty hath not weakened, and blessed is the one who turneth, whom the veils of creation have not prevented from turning unto God, the Lord of all worlds. Give thanks unto God for having been mentioned before His presence and for the revelation of this Tablet from which the sincere ones inhale the fragrance of the mercy of thy Lord, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.

This is the greatest counsel that hath flowed from the Pen of the Lord of destiny. The divine gaze is directed toward all and beholdeth all; no matter hath been or shall be hidden from Him. Let your resolve be lofty, and soar ye in this pure atmosphere on the wings of detachment. Be ye united and in accord in the Cause of God. The strong must assist the weak with the utmost kindliness and forbearance, that all may act according to the goodly deeds which have been revealed in the divine Tablets, and may become purified and sanctified from selfish desires and vain imaginings. Previously, holy and exalted Tablets in Persian and Arabic were sent to that region, that all might become assured through the grace of God and act according to that which they have been commanded. Observe how great is His favor, that from the Most Great Prison, despite countless afflictions, He summoneth you unto the infinite bounties of your Lord. He hath had and hath no purpose save the elevation of souls to the eternal and everlasting stations. Therefore unto the Lord belongeth praise, O people of Baha, and the praise of all who are in the heavens and on earth. From this exalted station and from this sublime horizon do We send Our greetings to Our loved ones and Our handmaidens.\n\n=== END BH02948 ===\n\n=== START BH02949 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful\n\nO mother, I write this letter to you in Persian that you may hear the sweet utterance of the divine bird in the Iraqi tongue and forget the melodious songs of Hijaz, and acknowledge that the spiritual nightingale sings in all tongues upon the holy branches in the gardens of the spirit, in remembrance and utterance, that you may hear from these outward songs the inward melodies.\n\nO mother, pass beyond the heart and turn to the Beloved of hearts; transcend the soul and attain to the Beloved of souls. Join the stream of the heart to the ocean of the Heart-Transformer, and firmly bind the cord of love to the root of nearness to the Loved One. A soul without the Beloved of souls is not worth a dirham, and a heart without the Beloved of hearts cannot be exchanged for a farthing. Better that the head without its Lord be in dust, better that the heart without pain be consumed, better that the neck without its cord be severed by the sword.\n\nSay: O friends, lie down thinking of the Friend, and find repose in your beds contemplating the Beloved. Smell the fragrance of the Beloved in the flowers, and behold in the bright flames the light of the countenance of the Friend. I swear by the life of the Friend that if you catch the fragrance of Joseph's garment and enter the Egypt of divine friendship, O mother, you will become one of all those near to God.\n\nTherefore strive with your soul in love and enter with your heart the abode of the Friend. Leave the grief of the age to those who belong to it. Pay no heed to the fleeting days of this world, that this old garment of the world may fall from your body and you may take up your dwelling upon the everlasting throne, don the divine brocade, drink from the cup of the Beloved the wine of love, be illumined by the candle of love, and sew the garment of love.\n\nThis is that which never changes. Know then that all divine laws in every age and dispensation change and are transformed according to the requirements of the time, except the law of love which forever flows and never changes or is transformed. These are the wondrous divine mysteries which He has mentioned for His servants, and He is the All-Bountiful, the All-Merciful.

He Who had been concealed from men's eyes is now come. How good is His coming! In one hand He is carrying the water of life and in the other the charter of true liberty. Cast ye away one thing and take hold of another. Cast away whatsoever pertaineth to the world and take firm hold of that which the hand of divine providence imparteth unto you. Lo, that which no eye hath ever beheld is now revealed. O friends! Hasten ye, hasten ye, hearken ye, hearken ye!\n\nThe deeds of the high priests have caused the people to be estranged from Almighty God. Instead of evincing self-denial they have given themselves up to inordinate desires and strayed far from the path of the Lord God. They have grievously erred, yet fondly imagine themselves to be treading the right Path. We have, however, warned the leaders of religion and taken them to witness, that they might in this day solemnly affirm His truth and guide His creatures unto the Spirit of Purity.\n\nSay, O high priests! Shake off your slumber, rouse yourselves from unconsciousness, incline your inner ears to the melody of the All-Sufficing and conduct yourselves in a manner that beseemeth the Day of God Himself.\n\nGreat is the station of him who hath in this Day perceived and become aware of the truth, and wretched is he who hath failed to comprehend the utterances of the Lord of wisdom and to recognize the newly-arrived Friend in His new attire.\n\nBehold, the Ocean of true knowledge hath appeared and the Day-Star of wisdom shineth resplendent. Incline your ears to the Voice of the Eternal Lord of Utterance and purge yourselves from whatsoever is deemed unseemly, that ye may become worthy to gain admittance into the court of your Creator. Say, in this Day the Almighty hath unloosed His tongue before the assemblage of men. It behoveth you to draw nigh unto Him and to grasp the truth of His weighty utterance. Indeed His utterance is a messenger that beareth the token of His presence. It delivereth you from darkness and guideth your steps unto the effulgent light of His glory.\n\nThy name was mentioned before Us and We have remembered thee in Our Tablet. This remembrance is like unto a sapling that We have planted with the hand of loving-kindness. Erelong will it grow verdant and flourishing, laden with abundant fruits.

In the name of the All-Powerful Speaker! This Wronged One hath from the earliest days until now been afflicted with tribulations and hardships at the hands of enemies, to such an extent as is beyond reckoning or limitation. Those who were shown the utmost favor - that is, those who were ignorant and were enabled to attain the ocean of knowledge, those who were poor and found their way to the horizon of wealth, those who in a few short years attained pure and holy blessings - were in the end so deceived by outward ornaments that they deviated from the straight path and engaged in unseemly deeds and actions. It was observed that the words and deeds of these souls would cause great corruption. Therefore, solely to preserve the Cause, the command to depart was issued. Later they proceeded to the great city and committed that which caused the very essence of truth to weep and the hearts of the chaste maidens in the most exalted Paradise to burn. The divine counsels had no effect upon them. They abandoned righteousness and piety and occupied themselves with tyranny and depravity. By the life of God! There hath befallen Us that which hath caused every possessor of heart and vision and conscience to lament. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me to the ocean of Thy bounty and for having remembered me in the prison when I was wronged at the hands of Thy servants. I beseech Thee, O Illuminator of the horizons and the One manifest on the Day of Meeting, by Thy Name through which the back of hypocrisy was broken, to assist me to be steadfast in Thy Cause and Thy love. O Lord! Deprive not Thy thirsty servant of the Kawthar of Thy grace, nor the poor one of the treasury of Thy generosity and bounty. O Lord! Thou seest Thy servants who turned away from Thee after having turned towards Thee, and were deceived by their wealth until they denied Thy right and rejected Thy favors and cast aside Thy gifts. O Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy sovereignty which hath encompassed all things, seen and unseen, to aid them to return unto Thee and to seek forgiveness before the gate of Thy pardon and to turn in repentance before the throne of Thy bounty. O Lord! Ordain for me all the good Thou hast sent down in Thy Book. Verily Thou art the Almighty, before Whose power the might of the world and the traces of nations were obliterated at the manifestation of Thy traces.

The promised Day hath appeared and the Mount circleth round the Manifestation, yet the people remain heedless. Today the mysteries of God's Book and the pearls of the ocean of divine knowledge are visible before the faces of the high and low, yet the seeker of the Goal is nowhere to be found. Reflect upon the previous Manifestations that thou mayest become aware of the harm done to this Wronged One. From the earliest days until now He hath been afflicted with endless tribulations. Most of His days were spent in the hands of enemies, chains were His companions and the harm of the tribes His associates. His friends withdrew and His loved ones arose to harm Him out of fear of enemies. His companion was the Tablet and His intimate the pen. Glory be to God! Most of the servants bear witness to what hath befallen Him and are aware of His tribulations. For some time now this Wronged One hath dwelt in this prison which hath been named the Most Great Prison. In the nights and days He is occupied with the remembrance of His loved ones and chosen ones. What hath come to pass that the people have shunned the light and turned to darkness upon darkness? Nevertheless, the heart is aflame with the fire of love and the tongue uttereth remembrance and speech. Blessed is the soul that was not prevented by the veils of names nor held back from turning towards Him by the doubts of the servants. Say: My God, my God! Prevent not Thy servants from the ocean of Thy bounty. If Thou forgivest them, this is of the wonders of Thy grace and bestowal; and if Thou chastiseth them, verily Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful. O Lord! Aid those who deny to turn towards the court of Thy glory and to acknowledge what Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy utterance. Thou art He through Whose name the ocean of forgiveness surgeth throughout creation. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Glorious, the All-Bountiful. We make mention of thy son who was named Ni'matu'llah and give him glad tidings of that which hath been sent down for him at this time from the heaven of the loving-kindness of the Lord of all worlds, that he may rejoice in My favors, speak My praise, hold fast to My cord and cling to My luminous robe.

He it is who cast aside the books of the world and took hold of the Mother Book by the command of God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. He attained unto the most great steadfastness in such wise that neither the clamor of the wasps deterred him from the Lord of Lords, nor did the power of the divines frighten him from the Lord of Names. He forsook the world and turned toward the Most Great Prison - the place which God made the footstool of His feet and wherein He revealed that which had been hidden and treasured in His Preserved Tablet.\n\nO 'Ali-Akbar!

Through them God provides His near servants with the fruits of wisdom and utterance, that He may detach them from all else besides Him and draw them nigh unto the precincts of glorious might. Say: He is verily the One with power over whatsoever He willeth, such that were He to desire to reveal in every moment proof after proof in establishment of His Cause, He would be able, and He hath ever been wise over all things. Say: Were He to desire to make but a single proof for His Cause and manifest it in every moment in another form, He would be able, and He hath ever had power over whatsoever He willeth. Say: Were He to send down upon a tree the decree of divine authority and upon what is beneath it, He would be able, and it behooveth none to object to Him, for He hath ever been the Doer of what He willeth, and He hath ever been encompassing over all things. Say: O people, be ye ashamed before Him Who, were He to desire to resurrect all created things through a word from His presence, would be able - and this is easy for Him. Nothing in the heavens or earth that He hath created can frustrate Him, and with Him is the knowledge of all things in a perspicuous Book. Say: O people, think not within yourselves that which beseemeth you not. Hearken unto the call of God, abandon the calf, and take what hath been sent down from the presence of One mighty and wise. Say: Do ye worship the idol instead of God? Woe unto you for what your passions bid you do. Fear God and take not the idol as your helper. And thou, O thou who hast turned to God, be steadfast in the Cause, purify thy spirit and body from the influences of those who have disbelieved and associated partners with Him in Whom they had believed, and who were rebellious against God. Sanctify thyself from such as these and consort not with them ever, and be in an impregnable protection.

Every tree has its visible fruit, as can be observed. A fruitless tree is fit only for the fire. The purpose of what they have commanded and taught has been the preservation of the stations and ranks of the human world. Blessed is the soul who in this divine Day has held fast to the divine principles and has not deviated from the true law. The fruits of the tree of existence are trustworthiness, religion, truthfulness and sincerity, and greatest of all, after the oneness of God, exalted and mighty be He, is due regard for the rights of parents. This matter is mentioned in all the divine Books and recorded by the Supreme Pen. Consider what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Qur'an, His words exalted be He: \"Worship God and associate naught with Him, and show kindness unto parents.\" Observe how kindness to parents is joined with the oneness of God.

Nevertheless, the heedless people have not become aware, nay rather, their heedlessness hath increased. O Ali, that which the eye of creation hath never seen hath become manifest, and from the Kingdom of utterance hath been sent down that which the ears of the people of possibility have never heard.

This is the Day wherein the breezes of God have wafted and that which was hidden from time immemorial hath been revealed. This is the Day wherein the Most Exalted Pen hath raised its shrill voice, inasmuch as the Most Glorious Temple hath been established upon the throne of 'He doeth whatsoever He willeth.' Blessed is he who hath heard the call, and woe unto every idolatrous liar!\n\nO Husayn, O Teacher! The Ancient Countenance hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, teaching thee that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of mankind. Blessed is the teacher who hath arisen to teach children and hath guided the people to the path of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Let not the affairs of the people grieve thee. Leave them and take hold of My Book through My power. It will deliver thee and draw thee nigh unto God, the Cleaver of Dawn. We beseech God to aid thee in His remembrance, His praise, and service to His Cause among His servants. O Husayn! The banner of triumph hath appeared and the standards of God's Cause have been planted upon the hilltops and branches. He desireth naught but the reformation of the world and the edification of nations. He Who possesseth the proof and evidence beareth witness unto this. Say: We call you for the sake of God and give you to drink from the cup of immortality from the hand of bounty. Blessed is he who hath taken and drunk, and woe unto every turning away deceiver!\n\nSay: O concourse of divines and mystics! Be fair in that which hath appeared in truth. It will draw you nigh unto God, the Revealer of verses. Nothing escapeth His knowledge, and He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nO Mir Muhammad-Husayn! Hear thou the call of the Wronged One, Whom God hath made the Water of Life for all creation and a Sign of eternity among the nations. Beware lest the doubts of the misguided ones prevent thee from drawing nigh unto the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. This is the Day wherein the ocean of knowledge hath surged and the fragrance of the garment of thy Lord's mercy, the Sovereign of earth and heaven, hath been diffused. When thou findest the sweet savors of My utterance and the fragrance of My bounty, say \\[...\\]\n\nMy God, my God! All praise be unto Thee for having given me to drink of Thy sealed wine through Thy self-subsisting Name, and for sending down unto me that whose fragrance endures through the perpetuity of Thy most excellent names and Thy most exalted attributes.

I beseech Thee by Thy Most Great Name and by the Word through which Thou hast subdued the world, to aid me to achieve supreme steadfastness such that neither the promptings of the guide nor the doubts of the guided shall deter me.

Be thou immersed in the ocean of utterance and speak forth this Name through which the near ones have soared to the most exalted horizon and to that station wherein all things proclaimed: \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Lord of Days!\" Blessed art thou for having turned unto Him and attained unto the evidences of thy Lord Who came from the heaven of proof with an argument before which, when it was sent down, all verses bowed down in submission. Thus have We set forth the utterance and sent it unto thee that thou mayest thank thy Lord, the Manifester of clear evidences.\n\nO Mahmud! The Promised One hath come and that which was hidden in God's knowledge, the Lord of all worlds, hath been made manifest.

We had mentioned them before in verses that brought joy to the eyes of them that know. O Mahmud! Hearken unto the scratching of My Pen and that which hath been sent down from the heaven of My bounty. Blessed is he who hath cast away vain desire, clinging fast to the fear of God which He hath made as a shield for the temple of His Cause, the Mighty, the Wondrous.\n\nAt this moment the tongue of My loving-kindness maketh mention of him who sought My presence with My leave, entered the gate of My majesty, heard My sweet call and the scratching of My Most Exalted Pen. He was named Javan-i-Ruhani by God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. He drank the wine of immortality from the hand of My bounty and attained unto that which was inscribed in My Great Book. Blessed is he and blessed are they who love him and who hearken unto his words in this wise Remembrance. We testify that he hath attained unto that which the sincere ones attained in this Great Announcement. The glory from Us be upon him and upon every steadfast and firm one, and every resolute and trustworthy one.\n\nO Hasan!

Blessed is he who hath attained and recognized His presence, and woe betide the heedless!\"\n\nVerily We desire at this hour to make mention of My friends in Kha who were not hindered by the doubts of the people from My Self-Subsisting Name, and whom the power of the deniers did not deter from turning unto God, the Lord of this exalted station. O Hassan Bey, hear with thy Persian tongue the Divine Call. The spiritual orators have appeared in the City of Lovers with such rapture and ecstasy as the eyes of the world have never witnessed, for the true lovers have attained the presence of the Beloved. The Mount is joyous on one side while the Tree is vocal on the other. The fire of love hath encompassed all save those souls who have deprived themselves of the merciful bounties and infinite favors. The Most Exalted Pen hath ever mentioned and will continue to mention the sincere ones. Give thou the glad-tidings from the Wronged One to the spiritual youth, for his presence hath been honored with acceptance and adorned with the ornament of God's good-pleasure, exalted be His glory. He is among those who have soared on the wings of trust in the atmosphere of the love of his Lord, the All-Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\n\nO people of God! Hold fast unto that which is conducive to the appearance of trustworthiness and chastity. Had the heedless servants held fast to the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen, the effulgences of the Day-Star of proof would now encompass all.

Thou wert remembered before the Throne and wert standing before the Face. He Who possesseth the perspicuous Book beareth witness unto this. Thou art he who hath attained unto the Kawthar of utterance and the signs of God, the Lord of the exalted Throne. Glorify on My behalf the faces of My loved ones and illumine them with My resplendent and manifest light. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of all beings and Creator of earth and heaven, for having enabled me to attain Thy presence in Thy days. I beseech Thee to make me steadfast in Thy remembrance, Thy praise, and Thy love, which Thou hast made the lord of deeds and virtues. Verily Thou art the Omnipotent over what Thou willest. There is none other God but Thee, the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.\n\nO Abbas! Hear the call from the Most Exalted Paradise. Verily it shall protect thee from the oppression of those who have denied the Day of Judgment. Beware lest the clamor prevent thee from the Lord of all beings. Cast away what is with the people and take My Book with the power that is from Him. Verily He is the Helper, the Compassionate, the Generous.\n\nO son of Qasim! The Promised One hath come, and the Shi'ih divines from all directions have pronounced sentence of death upon Him. Thus have their souls prompted them without any clear proof or perspicuous Book. Say: Praise be unto Thee, O Lord of Names, for having caused me to turn toward Thee when every remote scholar turned away from Thee. I beseech Thee to ordain for me what Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen ones. I testify that Thou art the Most Generous of the generous ones and the Most Merciful of the merciful.\n\nO Muhammad-Qabli!

The Lord of the worlds maketh mention of thee in the Most Great Prison, that thou mayest give thanks unto the Lord of all who are in the heavens and on earth. We have heard thy call and have answered thee through this mighty Tablet, and We have called out to thee from the shore of the sea of wisdom. God - there is none other God but Him, the Single, the One, the Self-Subsisting. He hath taken unto Himself neither counsellor nor peer. He hath appeared and made manifest that which was hidden in hearts and treasured in knowledge. Verily, He is the Omnipotent over whatsoever He willeth. There is none other God but Him, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nGrieve not over anything, but place thy trust in Him. Verily, He is with His servants who put their trust in Him. Give glad tidings to My loved ones on My behalf, and then to My handmaidens who have believed in the Single One, the All-Informed. We have made mention of them and have sent down for them that which We have made the Most Great Spirit for the body of the world and the light of utterance for all who are in the realm of possibilities.

In these days, the operation of two divine names may be witnessed with the utmost clarity: to wit, the names of \"Quickener\" and \"Destroyer\". These cause on the one hand death, and on the other, life. The one taketh life away from those that turn away from God; the other conferreth everlasting life upon those that turn towards Him.

How numerous the trees of human souls that have become fresh and verdant in this mystic, holy springtide, and richly laden with the fruits of divine knowledge! And how numerous the trees of human souls that have become parched and withered in this same season, deprived of all God's manifold bestowals!

The All-Seeing, the All-Knowing One has come - it is the time of sacrificing one's life. On this Day of bounty, strive that you may be recorded in the book of the righteous. None but the All-Merciful Lord has ever been, or is, capable of forgiving the wayward and the sinful. How can one who has not received existence bestow existence, and how can one who is himself guilty of error forgive error? Say: O high priests! The Beloved of the worlds calls you to God from His prison. Accept from Him, and flee not from Him Who has accepted endless tribulations for your deliverance. Pass beyond the seeming friend who is an enemy, and attach your hearts to the one true Friend. Say: O people, be content with that which the Friend has willed, for what He has chosen is indeed praiseworthy. Say: O high priests! No man's acts shall be acceptable in this Day unless he forsaketh mankind and all that men possess, and setteth his face towards the Omnipotent One.

Had these heedless, wayward souls turned, free from all hints and allusions, to the Most Exalted Horizon, all would surely have attained to the recognition of the Source of Names. In their primal reality, ears and eyes were created for the hearing of divine verses and the beholding of the lights of oneness. Therefore, all must today, when the Manifestation of the All-Merciful is established upon the throne of utterance, turn their ears to His call that they may attain to hearing it, and observe with their own eyes the evident matters in the days of His manifestation, and reflect with pure hearts upon the signs of power made manifest from the Source of divine Will. Should they act upon this merciful counsel that hath been sent down in the revealed Tablets out of pure bounty and grace, all shall attain to the wine of certitude and turn with complete assurance toward the All-Merciful. We beseech God to grant the divines of this age fairness, for these souls have become the cause of their own veiling and that of others from the Truth. Any learned one who hath today partaken of the most pure wine is accounted before God among the people of knowledge, and apart from such We testify that he is among the ignorant. Praise be to the Inaccessible God Who assisted thee to recognize the Dayspring of His verses. God willing, thou shalt at all times drink from the cup of divine love and remain turned toward His direction. After recognition and acceptance, steadfastness is the most mighty of matters. Ask thou of God that thou mayest remain steadfast in His love, for the evil ones have ever been and continue to be lying in wait, striving with the utmost effort and diligence to lead astray sanctified and accepted souls.

All minds are bewildered by Thy knowledge, all souls are powerless to comprehend Thy essence, all hearts acknowledge Thy sovereignty, and all realities confess Thy power. Yet how can anyone ascend unto Thee or any soul attain the summit of union with and presence before Thee? Nay, by Thy glory! All who claim to have reached Thee are but pretenders within themselves, and all who remember Thee are but confessors of their own limitations. For Thou canst not be known through aught else, that Thou mightest be mentioned through it, nor canst Thou be recognized by any matter, that Thou mightest be described by its remembrance. Glorified, glorified art Thou, O my God, above the essences of Thy servants' praise! Glorified, glorified art Thou above the wonders of Thy creatures' attributes! But O my God and Beloved of my heart, since Thou hast clipped the wings of understanding from soaring in the atmosphere of Thy holy oneness and hast prevented the hearts of those endued with certitude from ascending to the heaven of Thy mighty identity, Thou hast ordained for Thy servants to turn unto the Daysprings of Thy Cause in the temples of Thy name, and hast made their turning unto them as turning unto Thee, and their gaze upon their beauty as gazing upon Thy beauty. And all this was naught but a token of Thy bounty and a manifestation of Thy grace and favor. Thou hast ordained for them, O my God, a proof from Thee and an evidence from Thy presence, which is the revelation of Thy verses from the cloud of Thy mercy and the appearance of Thy signs from the heaven of Thy grandeur. Since this is what hath appeared from the horizon of Thy wisdom, therefore I beseech Thee, O my God, by the Mirrors reflecting Thy beauty and the Daysprings manifesting Thy majesty, that Thou forgive those who have migrated in Thy path and journeyed from their homes to the wellspring of union with Thee, and who have detached themselves from all else to reach the city of Thy presence, until they attained unto Thy presence and stood before the sanctuary of Thy nearness and the Kaaba of Thy glory, and found intimacy with Thy beauty and heard Thy melodies. Then, O my God, deprive them not of the wonders of Thy hidden knowledge and the gems of Thy treasured wisdom.

There hath befallen Us that which hath befallen none of God's chosen ones before, to such extent that the rock hath cried out, the Divine Lote-Tree hath lamented, and the wailing of all things hath been raised - yet the people remain in evident blindness. Doth anyone reflect on that which befell Muhammad, the Apostle of God, from the people of the Gospel, and that which befell the Spirit from the Jews? Doth any ponder on all that hath appeared at every Revelation? Thus doth My grieving Pen make mention, that perchance the slumbering may awaken and the sleeping may arise. Oppression hath reached such a degree that the heavens have wept and the clouds been thrown into commotion, yet most of the people remain heedless. This is a mention from Us to all who have believed and turned toward the All-Informed One. Know thou that thy brother, who was named after the First Pillar of this Name - whereby all in the heavens and earth were struck with terror save those whom the hand of grace took hold of and taught what appeared in creation by a command from the All-Knowing, the All-Wise - hath presented himself in the Most Great Prison. He hath drunk the Kawthar of immortality from the hands of bounty and mentioned thy name before the Countenance. Therefore have We sent down unto thee this clear Book. Recognize what the All-Merciful hath revealed, then preserve it in His Name, the Almighty, the Powerful. O My loved ones in the land of Ta! Hearken unto the call of this Wronged One, Whom God hath made a target for the arrows of destiny and tribulation between earth and heaven, and be not of the heedless ones. By the life of God! Nothing preventeth Us from mentioning you and those who have believed, with a mention that shall endure as long as God, the Sovereign, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised, endureth. We cast upon the world that which We have been commanded by the Lord of Eternity. My Most Great Name beareth witness to this, speaking from the Throne: \"There is none other God but I, the Mighty, the Generous.\" Hold fast to the cord of patience and to the wisdom which the All-Merciful hath sent down in His wondrous Book.

The soul that has ever been convinced of and confessed to utter powerlessness and complete effacement has been and will continue to be reckoned before the All-Merciful as one of the people of true knowledge. By the truth of My Self, thy letter which was in the Persian tongue is more beloved before God than the utterances of the deluded ones who day and night fancy themselves to have attained the stations of knowledge of the Lord of all possibility. For today the purpose of all things is that the fragrance of the good-pleasure of the All-Merciful should waft from them. Whatever thing is deprived of this station is recorded before God as among the most worthless of things. How many souls who day and night, in their own imagination, were occupied with the remembrance of the Lord of all names and were speaking the highest stations of vain mystical utterances, while the Truth was sanctified and exempt from all such souls. Observe how some souls are so weak that through the croaking of a croaker they have been and continue to be deprived of the ultimate goal and the divine Lote-Tree. The Truth, Whose lights of manifestation have encompassed the world and Whose banners of grandeur and power have been raised upon all hills and heights - they have remained far from Him through the word of the basest of people.

That which hath forever stood as a veil between the Truth and creation hath been the veils of self and desire. So long as these veils persist, the servant remaineth far removed from the assemblage of nearness, even should he stand before the Divine Throne. Yet after these veils are rent asunder, he standeth before His countenance, though outwardly he be a hundred thousand leagues distant. The purpose of man's existence hath been that, through the grace of the All-Merciful, he should be cleansed and purified from the defilements of creation, that he might become worthy to appear before the Greater Manifestation and enter the immortal celestial dominion of God. Should any soul fail to attain this station, no benefit would accrue to him even if he were to possess the whole earth and whatsoever is therein. As can be observed, preoccupation with this world and its trappings is the cause of affliction and abasement, not the source of freedom and repose. All the wondrous counsels and words of wisdom that God hath uttered through the tongues of His own Manifestations have been for the elevation of the souls of His servants, for verily He, the Most High, hath ever been, and shall ever remain, sanctified and exalted above the conditions of His creation and all that they possess.\n\nAs to what thou didst write expressing wonder at this forbearance despite such power--yea, in this are signs for the mystics, evidences for them that are nigh unto God, tokens for the hopeful, and intimations for the sincere. In darkness the light of the stars shineth bright and clear, and through the touchstone pure gold is distinguished from brass. In times when the descent of trials enshroudeth all contingent things in the darkness of might, the countenances of them that are nigh unto God and are sanctified shine forth with a crystalline radiance--those souls who have regarded all save the Beloved as non-existent and counted as nothing. Similarly, in the appearance of the touchstone and trials, he that turneth toward God is distinguished from him that turneth away. Whatsoever hath come to pass and shall come to pass hath been and shall be manifestations of divine wisdom, and none hath knowledge of its wisdom save His own Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. In all the Tablets mention hath been made of the trials of grievous years, that haply, when they should appear, the loved ones of God might not be perturbed. Nevertheless, that which was to appear hath appeared. All that hath been manifested and shall be manifested hath been and shall be by His command. None can avert His decree and none can repel His judgement. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.\n\nAs regards what was asked concerning the mixture of the four elements, it is known to thee that the combination of separated, external, and opposing elements is not possible. Indeed, the masters of the craft consider four elements necessary in their work, for they regard all things as subsisting through the four elements. In truth, all four are necessary to earth, for it is the seat of manifestation. Verily earth cannot bring forth vegetation without water, as is evident, hence water is necessary - \"and from water We made all things living.\" And earth deprived thereof brings forth neither herbage nor fruit. Fire too is necessary, for motion arises from heat and ever has, and in its absence no motion can occur, hence fire is necessary. And air, which is the cause of mixture and the source of colors, is assuredly necessary, and therein is ordained what is not ordained elsewhere, though people know it not. Indeed it is fire through its heat and water through its moisture, thus the work is perfected therein, were ye of those who know. And therein is combined what is not combined elsewhere - thus hath it been ordained by One mighty and powerful.\n\nThe four elements - namely fire, air, water and earth - after combination and coalescence manifest two qualities each: in fire there is heat and dryness, in air moisture and heat, in water cold and moisture, and in earth dryness and cold. Therefore in the hidden work some have been content with two elements, calling them male and female, spirit and body, for in two elements the four are manifest. This station they have expounded in detail and called by all names. Were the details of these degrees to be mentioned, the discourse would surely grow lengthy. Therefore it is briefly stated that in the aforementioned work one must search and find something from which these four elements themselves become manifest. For if they emerge from different things, their mixture is very difficult, just as water never has and never will mix with oil, unless there be found a water in whose depths oil is concealed, and through alchemical processes the inner oil overcomes the outer form - then that water, which is in reality oil, can mix and unite with oil.\n\nIn brief, what is intended by the hidden craft is that thou shouldst separate the four elements from a single thing, and after purifying each element from incidental impurities through dissolution and coagulation, unite these elements. The purpose of purification is that they be cleansed of impurities that prevent and obstruct, that they may become capable of true mixture. Now consider what thing is that stone from which the four elements are separated. Beware lest thou engage in practice before knowledge, for knowledge precedeth practice. Therefore strive to attain knowledge, then undertake the work. The stone exists in one of the three kingdoms and is visible in the streets and markets. Reflect that thou mayest know. And if thou findest it and separate it, then ask God to teach thee what He hath ordained therein, for with Him is the knowledge of all things, and the knowledge of the heavens and earth, and knowledge of what was and what shall be.\n\nIn these days that which is beloved and desired is that thou shouldst take somewhat of the active essence, which is love for the Servant of God, and place it upon the conflicting elements of the human temple, so that all may be cleansed, through the assistance of that Most Great Essence, from the dross of earthly realms and enter the eternal kingdom. This is that greatest elixir which transmuteth all the copper of existence into pure gold, and this is that crown of victory which by God's command prevaileth over all who are in the heavens and on earth. Blessed are they that attain! Thus have We imparted unto thee the truth. Ponder thou, therefore, that thou mayest recognize that which lieth concealed within the treasuries of thy Lord's protection, the Most High, the Most Great. All praise be to God, the Lord of all worlds.\n\n=== END BH03017 ===\n\n=== START BH03019 ===\n\nHe is!\n\nO Mariam! Jesus the Spirit has ascended to the placeless realm.

Sweet water has turned to blood and the precincts of the exalted Paradise have become mingled with blood. Yea, the luminous breasts of the friends are worthy of the shaft of the divine decree, and the necks of the lovers are eager for the noose of endless afflictions. Wherever there is an arrow, the breasts of dear ones it pierceth; and wherever there is grief, the hearts of companions it consumeth. The lover's eyes must be wet, whereat the Beloved may coyly flash an amorous glance. If the lover crieth out a hundred words of grief, the Beloved but turneth more away. If thou desirest the sherbet of reunion, sacrifice thy body on the plane of nothingness; and if thou seekest the wine of surpassing Beauty, set foot in the vale of privation. O Mariam! Give up sorrow to happiness, and dispel all grief from the cup of joy. If thou desirest to set foot on the path of search, be patient. Scratch not thy Dear One's cheek and let loose not thy tears. Rather be composed. Clothe thyself with the garment of resignation, and quaff from the pure wine of contentment. Sell this world for a dirham and let thy heart be captive to the divine decree and thy soul tied to destiny. Open the eye of admonition and remain chaste and faithful to the Friend that soon we may knock on the door of the hallowed Presence and enter the court of eternal communion, that we may hearken to Hijazi melodies coming from the \\`Iraqi harp and become united with our Best Beloved, that we may speak together of the ineffable mysteries and behold what eyes cannot bear to see, that we may set the temple of the spirit to dancing with the music of light and prepare the banquet of joy in the sacred precinct of life, that we may seize the chalice of beauty from the effulgent cupbearer and drain the peerless wine in remembrance of the face of the All-Glorious. Cleanse thine eyes from tears, sweep sorrow from the chamber of thy heart, set thy mind free from worry, and sing out with the sweetest of melodies. If one should bear a sword into the Beloved's house, Let us bare our necks and leave the decree to God.\n\n=== END BH03019 ===\n\n=== START BH03020 ===\n\nHe is the Most Generous, the All-Giving, the Impregnable\n\nSuch hath been the state that the fragrances of discord and dissension from those who profess loyalty have risen to such a degree that the atmosphere of the horizons hath become such that the Ancient Beauty hath determined to veil the effulgence of His peerless Beauty behind the veils of glory, in such wise that no pure light shall ever again be witnessed from Him. Therefore, in accordance with divine wisdom, He hath withdrawn Himself from all companions and emigrants, even from the servants, and repaired alone to another house, establishing there the throne of sorrows. This is the third time that successive migrations have occurred in this supreme migration, yet none have been like unto this one, for it was undertaken with complete volition while its people were rendering the utmost service. However, the details of this migration cannot be encompassed by explanation, pen, tongue or exposition.\n\nIf thou desirest to become acquainted with a drop thereof, refer to the Shirt of God which hath appeared in the form of words and letters in the Tablet of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. A Persian Tablet containing an Arabic verse at its head was presented before the Most Holy Throne in the sacred and most glorious presence. These wondrous and sublime words were revealed upon perusing it. May those manifestations of divine victory be made manifest in a wondrous temple and a new spirit.\n\nO thou who art beloved! Be ye informed that the Tablets contained in these four packets should not be lost. Remain firm and steadfast in all things and conditions in the Cause of God, the Resplendent, the Impregnable, and carry out the services to the Cause to whatever extent possible through hand, tongue, heart, soul and spirit. The details of these days are as revealed in previous Tablets and at the time of their revelation. Regarding the delivery of Tablets to their recipients, allow not the slightest delay or postponement. This is a command from the presence of the Mighty, the Self-Subsisting. The proclamation of this wondrous Cause is binding and obligatory upon all souls according to their capacity, and not a moment's delay, postponement or silence is permissible. Tomorrow, being Friday the 22nd of Shavval, the Peerless Beauty intends to move to another house.\n\n=== END BH03020 ===\n\n=== START BH03021 ===\n\nIn the Name of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful! Your letter reached the Wronged One of all horizons in the Most Great Prison, and what was written therein became known. You had written of your distress at the aforementioned person's lack of certitude in the Manifestation of the All-Merciful. Such a matter is most strange from souls who have drunk from the Kawthar of utterance and been illumined by the lights of the Sun of proof, for that which is necessary today is the teaching of God's Cause. However, in all tablets this most great matter has been made contingent upon wisdom. The imparting of the divine Word to receptive souls is beloved. The Wise One bestows not until He sees seeking, and water has no nearness until thirst appears. The seeds of divine wisdom must be deposited in pure and goodly soil; if the seed of bounty be sown a hundred thousand times in barren ground, it will yield no fruit. Therefore, you should not be distressed by the turning away and objections of the heedless and deniers. Concerning the Messengers, who are the proofs of God and the lamps of divine commandments, He has said: \"The Messenger's duty is but to convey the Message.\" Consider the Prophets: each one carried out that which they were commanded with utmost joy and fragrance. Whoso believes, believes for his own sake, and whoso denies, denies to his own loss. Whoso turns towards it, turns for his own sake, and whoso turns away, turns away to his own detriment. God willing, you should gaze with complete certitude toward the horizon of the Revelation of the All-Merciful, detached from all else. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, teach you. In reply to that person, words have also been revealed from the Supreme Pen, purely for the sake of God, that perchance he may remember and fear. Verily your Lord is the All-Bountiful, the Bestower, the Generous. Turn not to the people and their ways, but to God and what has been revealed from Him. Verily He is independent of the faith of every doubter, the acceptance of every denier, the unity of every idolater, the praise of every ignorant one, and the mention of every heedless one. Verily He is sanctified from all else beside Him, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. As for what you asked about the words of the late Shaykh Ahmad, that which suffices all has been revealed from the Supreme Pen concerning every matter. Blessed is he who searches and finds what God has revealed in the Books and Tablets.\n\n=== END BH03021 ===\n\n=== START BH03022 ===\n\nO Nabil, upon whom be the Most Holy and Most Great Glory of God!

Say: They have passed, by the Lord of what was and what shall be! One saith: Where are the earthquakes? Say: The tribes have been seized while ye were slumbering. When the standards of the signs appeared with clear proofs, the earth was shaken and the mountains crumbled, while ye were heedless. Do ye see any light in the sun before the lights of the Face? Nay, by My life, it hath darkened and the stars have fallen. Say: Have ye not heard when the Trumpet was blown, and every rejected idolater was thunderstruck? The All-Merciful hath come, and the smoke hath seized all in the worlds, yet they see not, save whom thy Lord, the Mighty, the Loving, willeth. Say: Do ye see for yourselves any refuge or escape? Nay, by the Lord of the Unseen and the Seen! Rend ye the veils by the sovereignty of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Beware lest the buzzing of flies prevent you from turning to God, the Self-Subsisting, the Eternal. Remember when there came in Iraq one who desired to test God. When We manifested unto him, he broke the Covenant and turned back to his kind, even as people turned back in former ages. Among the people is he who came to the Most Great Scene, and We shed upon him the lights of the Face, whereupon he was thunderstruck. When he recovered, he believed in God, the Mighty, the Beloved. And among them is he by whom We passed in the marketplace, and who heard a verse from the verses of his Lord, whereupon longing seized him and he turned to the Intended One. Say: O people! Were ye to look with the purest eye, ye would see in all that hath appeared in this Revelation the sovereignty of God and His power prevailing over every witness and witnessed thing. O thou who hast turned to the Face! Thy name hath been mentioned before the Throne, and there hath been sent down for thee that which causeth the sincere ones to soar. Seize thou the days of God, then aid Him with that which will awaken those who slumber. Victory hath been confined to utterance in this Revelation wherein the All-Merciful hath manifested Himself to all who are in the worlds. Thus have We commanded the people in the Tablets, yet most of them understand not.

Blessed are the fair-minded. How many servants for whom We ordained what they desired, yet when they attained it they denied God, the Lord of the worlds! How many drew nigh but achieved not, and how many were kept back yet attained! He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Should thou ask of the Youth, verily He is in grievous affliction. Blessed is he who hath read the Tablets of God which were sent down aforetime from One All-Knowing, All-Wise, wherein was detailed every matter and whatsoever was visited upon Us by the oppressors. Were I to rend asunder the veils, I would behold My Name, the All-Concealing, clinging to My hem, saying: \"Thou art the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful,\" and were I to leave them as they were, I would witness My Name, the Subduer, saying: \"Thou art possessed of mighty strength.\" My mercy hath preceded My wrath, therefore have We borne and forebore, known and concealed, and I am the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate. Is there anyone who pondereth My patience after My knowledge, and My forbearance after My power? Is there any who will arise to help My Cause, detached from all else but Me? Is there any who will cast aside what was ordained in creation and hasten with Me in the wilderness of detachment? Is there any possessed of might who will eschew all that is in creation, turning unto God, the Mighty, the Most Praised? Thus have We showered upon thee from the ocean of utterance that which will draw thee to God, the Peerless, the All-Informed. Be thou thankful that the countenance of the Beloved hath turned toward thee from this remote prison, and hath sent down for thee that which attracteth the hearts of them that draw nigh. Be thou steadfast in the Cause through the power and might of God, then aid this Wronged One Who hath been forbidden to gaze upon the earth which was created by His transcendent, mighty, and impregnable command.

And the near ones make mention of him in the heaven of eternity, for the Most Exalted Pen hath been moved to his remembrance by the fingers of Glory. Thus did the bounty of his Lord encompass him, and verily His bounty towards the sincere ones hath ever preceded in truth. Blessed art thou, O servant, for thou hast dyed thy radiance with fire. By God! By radiance We mean but thy hair which turned white in thy faith in God, and by fire We mean but thy crimson blood. Thus did the Dove of the Spirit warble upon the branches of the Divine Lote-Tree in this dark and gloomy night, that the mercy of God might be witnessed by all the worlds. How wonderful art thou, O servant who hast ascended unto God and detached thyself from all else, for thy beard was reddened with thy blood in the path of thy Lord. By God! This is a station which the Ancient Beauty Himself longeth for, and God is witness unto this. O ye dwellers in the tabernacle of holiness, whom God hath related unto Himself! By God! It behooveth you to glory in him and make mention of him throughout all nights and days. Thus doth the Pen of the All-Merciful command you now upon a luminous and mighty finger. And the Maids of Paradise, and the secluded Maidens of eternity, and the Countenances whom God created from the light of Glory before the creation of earth and heaven, find his fragrance. And upon their brows is inscribed by the golden Pen: \"By God! They are the handmaidens of Glory and were created for those who were martyred in the path of this Youth Who sitteth upon the throne of cloud.\" Thus was the matter decreed in truth by the finger of the Spirit upon the Tablet. Thus doth God strengthen whom He willeth with might from His presence, and verily He hath made might exclusively His own and His loved ones', if thou be of them that know.

Fear God and deny not Him through Whom the Sun of Knowledge hath shone forth from the horizon of utterance, and the breezes of forgiveness have wafted over Our sinful servants. He desireth naught from you, and hath sacrificed His spirit for all who are in the heavens and on earth, out of His love for God, your Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Do ye deny Him through Whom the veils of idle fancy were rent asunder and the Beauty of the Ancient of Days shone forth from the horizon of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing? Say: Do ye imagine, O people, that ye have any refuge other than God? Nay, by His Self, were ye but to know! Say: There is today no refuge for anyone and no protector for any soul save God, in Whose grasp lieth the kingdom of all who are in the heavens and on earth. O people! Fear ye God, then detach yourselves from those who have disbelieved and associated partners with God and who remain behind a thick veil. Turn your hearts toward the court of your Lord, the Most High, the Almighty, the Powerful. Beware lest anything prevent you from turning unto God, the Goal of all who seek Him. And thou, O servant, turn thy face toward the Sanctuary that thou mayest be numbered among the triumphant. Say: This is verily God's Sanctuary among you, and His holy Kaaba in your midst, and His Most Great, Most Holy, Wondrous and Impregnable House. Beware, O people, lest ye be heedless of it, for this would be a grievous loss. Blessed art thou, O servant, for having attained unto the recognition of God in this Revelation, whereby the foundations of the idolaters were shaken, the idols of fancy and vain imaginings were shattered, and the Jibt and Taghut were cast down upon the face of the earth, whereupon the hearts of the deceivers were consumed. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and fear no one, for thy Lord, the All-Merciful, shall suffice thee against the harm of the deniers. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth that thy soul might be assured thereby and thou mightest be of them that are firmly established.

Thou didst hasten unto the Beloved until thou didst enter the sacred court and circumambulate the House. Thy Lord, verily, encompasseth all things, and with Him is the knowledge of what hath been and what shall be. Beseech God to make thee steadfast in His love, that the signs of those who judge according to their own understanding without true comprehension may not cause thee to waver. Say: O people! Abandon your desires. This is the Ocean of guidance surging before your faces. Turn ye unto it, and follow not those who are heedless of the signs of God. God willing, thou shalt ever drink from the cup of steadfastness through the bounty of the eternal Sovereign. O servant! The station of steadfastness is most great. Ask God to enable thee to achieve it. Many are the souls who reached the shore of oneness, yet afterwards were deprived by a single word from the Truth. Today it is observed that certain souls, having clung to one of the cords, have remained far from the Self-Subsisting Lord. O Hashim! Hold fast to the cord of God's loving-kindness and cling to the hem of His grace, and whatsoever thou hast heard from the Truth, mention it with pure sincerity. Praise be to the Exalted Truth that thou hast attained to a station mention of which shall forever be recorded in the divine Books. This is of God's grace - He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth. Convey My greetings to the loved ones of God and counsel them with wisdom. Among the commandments is that no one is permitted to turn toward this direction. Say: O people! Follow not your desires. Take what ye are bidden. This is better for you than that which ye imagine. Great is the corruption in this land. Soon shall that which is hidden in its midst be made manifest. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Forget not what thou hast heard and seen.

But when its appointed time drew nigh and He manifested Himself with all the signs and tokens, with power, majesty and sovereignty, most of the servants denied Him and turned away from Him, and were recorded in the Tablets as idolaters. And among the deniers was one who said that so-and-so had not believed in this Cause. Say: Woe unto thee! He whom ye made the criterion for God's Cause hath stumbled on the path and returned to his former state, if ye be aware. Say: O people! Fear ye God and link not God's Cause to anyone's will, for all else was created by His will. He is in truth the Ruler Who ordaineth as He pleaseth, and He hath power over all things. Fear God, O people, and make not your desires your god, and wage not war against Him through Whom God's Cause hath been manifested in every age and dispensation.\n\nThus do We inspire thee, O Muhsin, that thou mayest be gladdened in thyself by this bounty.

Say: O people of the Bayan, have mercy upon yourselves and waste not the Cause of Him Who was promised in the Tablets. Fear God and doubt not His Cause, for verily He hath appeared with manifest sovereignty. Say: Is there any doubt concerning Him, or concerning the verses revealed unto Him, or concerning His power which hath encompassed all worlds?

Such is the condition of those who have imagined themselves to be the most exalted of all creation in the sight of God. Yet today their names shall not be mentioned in the Tablets except among those who have disbelieved, who have joined partners with God, and who were among the deniers.\n\nSay: O people! Come ye to a word common between us and you - that God is our Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old. In every age He hath sent forth a Messenger to draw men nigh unto Him and to remind them of the days of God - this is what hath been revealed in all the Books, did ye but know it. And with them He sent down a proof, that His evidence might be perfected unto all created things and His dominion be made manifest to all the worlds. Until the day arrived wherein God came in the shadows of the clouds and the matter was decided by God, the Almighty, the Powerful.\n\nO people of the Bayan! Ye claim to believe in Him. If ye believed in His Self without proof or evidence, then believe in this One Who hath appeared among you and hath come to you from the direction of immortality with God's paradise, the Mighty, the Generous. For verily He is His very Self, His Essence, His Spirit, and His Being, whereunto all things bear witness, if ye be of them that testify. And if ye believed in Him through the proof He showed you, then bring forth proof equal to or greater than what We possess, if ye can. Therefore fear God, reject not His proof, and be not of the unbelievers.\n\nAnd should ye say \"We know not what God hath made as proof against us\" - this is but injustice from your own selves against yourselves and against God Who created you from a handful of lowly clay. For He is far exalted above sending down to His servants that whereby they cannot recognize His Self, the Supreme, the Most High, the Magnificent. Their heads shall be bowed to the earth and the dust of hell shall overwhelm them.\n\nBy God the Truth! None hath today any proof, nor evidence, nor path. Thus have We detailed the matter unto thee, that thou mayest become aware of what issueth from the mouths of the idolaters. They seek to prove their cause through God's verses, yet when there is recited unto them that which attracteth the hearts of all created things, their faces turn black and they return to the abode of rejection, among the lowest of the low.\n\nKnow thou that We have ordained for thee in the heaven of Our Cause a station among stations. Beware lest thou be heedless of it. Be thou steadfast in the Cause and detached from all who are in the heavens and the earth. When thou didst attain the presence of the Throne in Iraq, We ordained for thee the good of this world and the next, and We sent it down from the heaven of the unseen to the heaven of destiny. It hath been sent down upon thee every year and shall continue to be sent down hereafter if thou remainest steadfast in the love of God and art among the firm ones.\n\nRend asunder the veils and be not disturbed by those who have disbelieved and joined partners with God, for they walk in the paths of fancy and are not among those who know. We have veiled the Cause from the servants for a wisdom from Us. If thou wouldst reflect, God would cast upon thee that which none among the worlds hath known. Thou knowest that they have not understood the Cause and its foundation, and today they speak according to their own vain desires.\n\nToday they speak according to their own desires and are among the unaware. Say: Today nothing shall profit anyone except by severance from those in whose hearts is found rancor towards God. And verily this is the foundation of the Cause, sent down in truth from the presence of a Wise, All-Knowing One.\n\nThen know that My brother who was named the Mirror - by the True One! We protected him in the fortress of Our power, then strengthened him and taught him at all times, and We elevated his name lest those who disbelieved among the former religions discover the origin of the Cause and arise to cut down the Tree. God is witness and knower of this. Therefore We were in opposition to both enemies and friends, and none recognized Us except a few of those possessed of certitude. We raised up the Cause alone until it became renowned in all lands and faces turned toward the countenance of their Ancient Lord. By the True One! In the years when the Luminary of the horizons shone forth from the horizon of Iraq, the peoples arose to extinguish it, but God refused until He made His Cause victorious through His sovereignty, for He has power over all things.\n\nWhen the breezes of assurance wafted, he who had been concealed behind the veil emerged and desired to cut down the Divine Lote-Tree, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. But God prevented him through His sovereignty and banished him through His power, and revealed to those who had migrated what was hidden in his breast. Verily He uncovers what He wishes through His command, and He encompasses all things. When he found himself disappointed in what he desired, he then arose to spread calumnies to conceal his deed and to instill rancor toward the Youth in the hearts of the monotheists. He knew not that My loved ones are beneath the domes of My providence - nothing in the kingdom can obstruct them and the opposition of the opposers cannot prevent them. These are they whose eyes God has opened and who have recognized the Manifestation of His Self, and He has made them detached from the worlds.\n\nThus have We informed you that you may become aware of the Cause and remain steadfast with mighty steadfastness. Then know that your letter came before Us and We saw what was in it, and We were among those who perceived. We have sent down this Tablet to you and dispatched it to you as a mercy from Us upon you, that you may thank your Lord and be among the thankful.\n\nAs to what thou hast asked concerning the esoteric sciences, know thou that most of what thou hast heard regarding these sciences neither nourishes nor profits, even should one master them. That which truly profiteth is the knowledge that lieth concealed within the treasuries of thy Lord's knowledge, which none hath discovered save God, the Most High, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. By the tongue of the wise it hath been called the Hidden Art and the Treasured Secret. By My life! It is verily a noble science. Whomsoever God aideth to attain and comprehend it shall discover the mysteries of creation, shall be independent of all save God, shall be confident in the power of his Lord, and shall be numbered among those who are certain. We have written various treatises concerning this science, yet none hath gained access to even a single letter thereof, for the hand of God is upon it, and He bestoweth it upon whomsoever He willeth among His servants. Verily, He is the Sovereign, the Bestower, the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.\n\nWere We to set forth its knowledge in this Tablet, it would be difficult for thee to comprehend it as it truly is. Therefore have We stayed Our Pen from mentioning it, that perchance God may bring about thereby a matter whereby the veil between Me and thee may be lifted, and We may teach thee in person, that thou mayest attain unto clear vision and certainty. And if thou art prevented from drawing nigh unto the Holy Court by the decree that is firmly established, and the servant remaineth in the realm of mortality, We shall assuredly send down its knowledge in the Tablet and dispatch it unto thee as a mercy from Our presence upon thee and upon those whom God hath made the treasuries of His mystery and the custodians of His knowledge. Verily, He is the best of protectors and the All-Wise.\n\nSay: God is more knowing than anyone possessed of knowledge. He createth knowledge as He willeth in all things, and with Him is the knowledge of the heavens and of the earth and the knowledge of all the worlds. By God, the Truth! If thou wert today to search throughout all the regions of the heavens and the earth, thou wouldst find knowledge with no one, though they speak of knowledge they know not. Rather, they speak only of that which hath trickled upon them from the spray of this Ocean, according to their capacity and station. Yet We desire to sprinkle upon thee the most complete thereof, that thou mayest be of them that know. And may the splendor that hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity be upon thee, that it may detach thee from all else but God and make thee steadfast in His Cause, that thou mayest be of them that are firmly rooted.\n\n=== END BH03032 ===\n\n=== START BH03033 ===\n\nThis is the Tablet of God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting, revealed to the children of Abraham and the heirs of Moses from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful.\n\nIn My Name, the Guardian over the Kingdom of Utterance!

It behooveth you in all conditions to arise, in the name of the True One, exalted be His glory, to make mention and give praise and to serve the Cause with such arising that neither the opposition of the oppressors nor the turning away of the deniers shall hinder you. And you must, through the bounty of God, exalted be His glory, become so enkindled with the fire of the blessed Tree that its effects shall become manifest in the world.

The Shi'ih sect counted themselves the most excellent of all people, yet they were witnessed to be the most lost. It is incumbent upon all the friends of God to protect these helpless people lest they become again afflicted with the vain imaginings of the former party and remain deprived of the recognition of the Purpose. Convey My greetings to those who have turned towards Me and illumine them with the lights of the utterance of the Purpose of all worlds. Blessed art thou and they, and blessed is he who hath attained unto this firm and mighty Cause and this Great Announcement. The Glory be upon thee and upon them from God, the Lord of the worlds. Say: My God, my God! By Thy might, I love to hold fast to all things by virtue of their connection to Thy Name, the Creator. I beseech Thee by the suns of the heaven of Thy knowledge and wisdom, and by the seat whereon hath been established the throne of Thy grandeur, and by Thy Call which hath been raised amongst Thy servants, and by Thy Will which hath dominated all things, and by Thy mercy which hath preceded earth and heaven, to assist me in that which befitteth Thy Manifestation and Thy days. Then ordain for me that which Thou hast ordained for Thy trusted ones and chosen ones who have offered up their spirits in Thy path.

Today the Key to the treasures of earth and heaven and the gates of guidance has been and is the Supreme Pen. Blessed is the eye that attains to the vision of its traces and the ear that is adorned with hearing its call. O my handmaiden and my leaf! Your call has repeatedly been heard and the answer has likewise descended repeatedly from the heaven of loving-kindness. Give thanks to the Goal of the worlds that He has confirmed you and bestowed upon you that which the divines, men and women of the earth have been deprived and forbidden from, except whom God wills. Say: O handmaidens, know ye the value of the days of God and His station. All divine Books have given and give glad tidings of it, and likewise the Prophets and Messengers. This Day has no likeness or parallel. The ocean of utterance is at all times surging in the realm of possibility, and sanctified pure ears hear from its waves \"The Truth has come.\" The attraction of the revelation of the Mount has encompassed all, and the rustling of the Divine Lote Tree has set ablaze the tree of Sinai. Rejoice, O My handmaiden, in that the countenance of the Ancient One hath turned toward thee from His Most Great Prison, and mentioned thee in such wise that all things have been moved and drawn in their inmost reality. Say: My God, my God! Praise be to Thee for having guided me, caused me to hear, shown me, and made me know Thy Call, Thy verses, Thy laws and Thy commandments. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the choice wine of Thy Most Glorious Name whereby all on earth and in heaven were intoxicated, and by the pearls hidden in the shells of the ocean of Thy bounty, and by the lights shining and blazing from the horizon of the heaven of Thy utterance, to make this handmaiden of Thine in all conditions attracted to Thy verses, speaking Thy praise and arising to serve Thee. Verily Thou art the Powerful One to Whom all created things have testified and all contingent beings have confessed. There is no God but Thee, the Mighty, the Dominant, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. His honor Salman attained to presence and meeting, and carried out on thy behalf what thou desired, and We testify that he attained to acceptance. Verily thy Lord is the Compassionate, the Mighty, the All-Loving.

Yet ears worthy of hearkening to this Most Exalted Word are rarer than red sulphur. Blessed is the soul whom neither the chains of blind imitation nor the power of those who would set limits has prevented from the Dayspring of Divine Unity or deprived of the ocean of the All-Merciful's utterance. The waves of the ocean of manifestation surge before all faces, and the effulgences of the Sun of Truth shine forth from every direction. Yet the desires of self and passion have become an obstacle, preventing eyes from beholding the Most Exalted Horizon and ears from hearing the scratching of the Most Exalted Pen. We beseech God to make all aware and not deprive them of the outpourings of His days. He is the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\n\nYour letter was forwarded to the Most Holy Court by Afnan, upon him be My glory. Praise be to God, the fragrance of love and devotion wafted from it. We beseech God, blessed and exalted be He, to assist you in that whose fragrance will never cease to endure throughout the dominion of His kingdom and His sovereignty, and to make you a standard of His name amongst His creation. Verily He is powerful over whatsoever He willeth through His word \"Be\" and it is.\n\nThe aforementioned youth attained Our presence and meeting - although for several years this Wronged One has not associated with any of the outside parties. We met with them repeatedly and signs of purity were evident from his countenance. We beseech God to assist him in that which will cause the eradication of corruption and establishment of the reformation of the world. Verily He is the Hearer, the Answerer. The details will surely be mentioned by his honor Afnan. Convey on behalf of the Wronged One greetings to the friends in that land and illumine them with the splendors of the light of the Sun of remembrance. Glory shining from the horizon of the heaven of God's loving-kindness be upon you and upon those who have turned with radiant hearts and shining faces to the Most Exalted Horizon, the station wherein all atoms proclaim: \"The kingdom and the dominion, the grandeur and might belong to God, the Lord of the mighty throne and the elevated seat!\"\n\n=== END BH03065 ===\n\n=== START BH03066 ===\n\nIn His Name, the Ever-Abiding, the Imperishable!\n\nHearken unto the Call from the Master of the Crimson Ark from the precincts of 'Akka which hath been named the Snow-White Spot.

Verily the Word at all times proclaimeth that Word from which wafteth the fragrance of God, thy Lord and the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is he who hath cast away all else save Him and taken that which was given unto him from One mighty and powerful. Thy letter hath come before the Most Great Scene, and the glance of loving-kindness hath been directed towards it. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful. We beseech God to aid thee in His Cause and to acquaint thee with that which will detach thee from all else save Him, that thou mayest arise to make mention of Him amongst His servants, that the breaths of remembrance may draw them to His luminous and shining horizon. As to what thou didst desire regarding nearness and reunion, the loved ones of God have been prevented therefrom by reason of what the hands of the transgressors have wrought. So grievous hath Our plight become in this Prison that the tongue is powerless to describe it and the Pen unable to recount My supreme affliction. Grieve thou not at this.

I beseech Thee, O Lord of all names and Creator of heaven, to ordain for me the reward of those who have circled round Thy Throne, and hearkened unto Thy call, and drunk the choice wine of reunion from the fingers of Thy bounty. Then cause me, O my God, to be steadfast in Thy love in such wise that the denial of the deniers and the words of the proud ones who have clung to the cord of vain imaginings and have turned away from the Lord of all men Who hath come with manifest sovereignty, may not hinder me. O Lord! Deprive me not of the ocean of Thy knowledge, and leave me not to myself for less than the twinkling of an eye. Preserve me, then, beneath the shadow of Thy mercy and Thy favors.

Cast behind thy back all created things, then turn thy face toward God with a countenance from which the lights shine forth. By God! Should anyone hear the call of his Lord and taste the sweetness therein, it would surely draw him to the court of nearness and glory and beauty. O Ha! Hear once again the call of thy Lord, the Most Glorious, from the direction of this Prison from whose horizon hath shown forth the Sun of the beauty of thy Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower. Arise to make mention of Him amongst the servants and fear not those who have denied the Return.

By My life! Should one possessed of hearing turn toward all things, he would hear from them \"The Kingdom belongeth unto God, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Forgiving!\" O Sin! That which was hidden in the breasts hath been unveiled, the secrets have been revealed, and every soul hath been gathered according to its deeds in this Day whereon the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the throne of grandeur and power. Say: O people! Do ye deny that which ye were promised? Fear God and be not of them whom We behold in doubt and schism. This is the Promised One Who hath come from the dawning-place of the Promise with proof and evidence. O Nun! Be thou as the letter Nun of this Ocean - immerse thyself therein by thy Lord's leave at morn and eventide. Stand firm in His love and remind the people of thy Lord's verses. This is better for thee than all that hath been created in the contingent world. Let not the words of those who have disbelieved in God grieve thee. Already hath been inscribed upon their foreheads: \"These are they who have disbelieved in the Lord of Lords.\" Beware lest thou pause in the remembrance of thy Lord. Be thou a herald of My Name and glorify His praise at eve and dawn. Soon shall come a day when thou shalt behold the wrongdoers in the fire, and thyself in the vicinity of the mercy of thy Lord, the Self-Subsisting.

These days shall pass away and that with which people are occupied. Say: He knoweth the unseen of the heavens and earth and all that ye conceal or hide. Nothing shall be hidden from God thy Lord. He knoweth what penetrateth the earth and what issueth forth from it, if ye would but understand. And since His mercy hath preceded His wrath, He concealeth for whom He willeth and revealeth for whom He willeth, and verily He is the Mighty, the Beloved. Say: O people! Return ye unto God, then seek His forgiveness, and follow not Satan within yourselves if ye wish to be God-fearing. And be not of those in whom God findeth naught, such that He findeth in them neither truthfulness nor faithfulness nor steadfastness in any matter. Soon shall they return to dust and they shall be remorseful. God will not show them mercy nor will He ever forgive them, even if they wail in the fire. And thou, O servant, fear God and associate not with those from whose hearts and souls thou perceivest the winds of hypocrisy, and avoid them and abide under a preserved protection. This is My counsel unto thee and unto those who act according to what they claim.

The Wronged One is between the fangs of wolves, calling the people to God, the Lord of the Final Return. He was seated when the hand of power raised Him up, and was silent when the Command of God, the Lord of lords, caused Him to speak. There befell Him in the path of God that which caused the stars to fall and the clouds to cry out. He has arisen to promote the Cause with such steadfastness that the tyranny of the world did not prevent Him nor did the hatred of the wicked frighten Him. He has spoken what He desired before the faces of the servants, causing the kingdom of the heart to quiver. We beseech God to assist thee and make thee successful in what He loves and is pleased with, to make thee speak His Name and gaze toward His horizon, to make thee detached from all else save Him and clinging to the hem of the robe of His mercy which has preceded the earth and the heavens.

Read ye the verses of God with joy and fragrance - they draw you to the Most Exalted Horizon and bring you near to the sublime station. We make mention of the loved ones at all times that they may arise to serve the Cause and assist their Lord through the wisdom sent down in a preserved Tablet. Blessed are you for having attained unto the days of God and His knowledge. Ask Him to aid you in following His Cause that has encompassed all in the heavens and earth. Thus has the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in the Most Great Prison that you may rejoice in the bounty of your Ancient Lord. May glory rest upon you and upon those who have turned to God when He came with His exalted and mighty Kingdom.\n\n=== END BH03076 ===\n\n=== START BH03077 ===\n\nIn the Name of the one true God! May you, through the bestowals of the All-Merciful and the outpourings of the Lord, attain success and be nourished from the table of detachment, which is the greatest of divine bounties. Your mention was made in the presence of the Wronged One and your cry was heard. God's grace hath ever surrounded and will continue to surround the name of Jamal and those connected with him. Among the greatest bounties of God is that He enabled you to recognize the Dawning-Place of His verses and the Dayspring of His evidences, while most of mankind are deprived and forbidden from this most exalted station. Be thankful unto thy Lord, the Generous Bestower. His honor Jamal, upon him be my glory, hath expressed satisfaction with you. Blessed art thou for having won his good-pleasure and fulfilled God's Covenant, the Lord of all worlds. We have accepted your deeds in the path of God and have mentioned you time and again in this Great Prison. Regarding what you wrote about ridicule, be patient and do not grieve. He verily recompenseth the patient women and His patient servants. Whosoever hath uttered unseemly words regarding his honor Jamal hath spoken contrary to what God hath ordained. However, his honor Jamal must in all conditions observe and hold fast to the wisdom revealed in the divine Tablets, that none may find cause for objection. Wisdom is among the commandments which God hath enjoined upon all in most of the Tablets. None may transgress it by a hair's breadth. Thus hath God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy, decreed. Whoso followeth God's command, God will assist him through His grace and exalt him in truth. He is verily the Almighty, the Powerful. The Wronged One hath desired naught for Himself and enjoineth His loved ones to that which God hath commanded Him in a preserved Tablet. Grieve not over anything. We have chosen for you what is greater than what you have chosen for yourselves, and ordained that which gladdeneth the hearts of them that know. Rejoice in thy Lord's remembrance. He hath sent down for thee that whereby thy mention shall endure throughout the kingdom of earth and heaven. Thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed, beareth witness to this. Glory be upon thee and upon thy mother and thine aunt and her daughter, from One mighty and wise.\n\n=== END BH03077
